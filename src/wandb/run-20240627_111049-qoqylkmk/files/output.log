KeyError: 'question'
{'1403.0007_1': {'title': 'Cosmic Star-Formation History', 'question': ' How has the UV luminosity function of galaxies evolved from z~4 to z~8 according to analyses of deep HST data?', 'text': 'Early analyses of the GOODS data (Giavalisco et al. 2004a) found evidence for relatively mild evolution of the UV luminosity density from 2 < z < 5 and clear evidence that there were fewer high-luminosity galaxies at z≈6 (Stanway et al. 2003, Dickinson et al. 2004). Subsequent studies have repeatedly mined the combined GOODS+HUDF observations, using deeper data and more rigorous analyses. At least 20 papers about high-redshift LFs using WFC3 data in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS have been published since 2010, augmenting at least a dozen others pre-WFC3. We cannot attempt to review them all here, but they have convincingly demonstrated that the UVLF evolves significantly at z>4. The current consensus is that this is primarily luminosity evolution, at least at 4 < z < 7, with L∗ brightening over time (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2007, 2012b; Grazian et al. 2011). As a result, the number density of bright LBGs increases rapidly with time, more quickly than does the integrated luminosity density. Analyses using the CANDELS and HUDF09+12 NIR imaging point to continued evolution out to z = 8 and perhaps beyond (Oesch et al. 2012, Yan et al. 2012, Lorenzoni et al. 2013, Schenker et al. 2013), although it would be prudent to recall that only a handful of galaxies at z≈7 have reasonably secure spectroscopic confirmation and none at z>7.5. There is broad agreement that UV spectral slopes for LBGs are bluer at z>4 than at lower redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013), which has implications for their dust extinction and total SFRD. Most of these studies have examined the faint-end slope of the LF, measuring very steep values, in some cases approaching or exceeding the divergent value α=−2 (Bouwens et al. 2012b, McLure et al. 2013). Several studies have also extended SFRD analyses to 9 < z < 12, using data from the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011a, Ellis et al. 2013) or from lensing cluster studies (Coe et al. 2013). Although still in flux as better data accumulate, these measurements have considerable significance for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and for the reionization of the IGM (e.g., Robertson et al. 2013), but relatively little impact on the global star-formation budget of the Universe. According to current estimates, only ∼1% of the cosmic SMD present today was formed at z>6.', 'citations': [['Bouwens', '2007'], ['Dickinson', '2004'], ['Ellis', '2013'], ['Coe', '2013'], ['Oesch', '2012'], ['Bouwens', '2011'], ['Schenker', '2013'], ['Giavalisco', '2004'], ['Stanway', '2003'], ['Yan', '2012'], ['McLure', '2013'], ['Finkelstein', '2012'], ['Grazian', '2011'], ['Dunlop', '2013'], ['Lorenzoni', '2013'], ['Bouwens', '2012'], ['Robertson', '2013']], 'arxiv': ['1201.0755', '1212.4819', '1208.3529', '0309070', '0302212', '1207.2727', '1212.0860', '1211.6804', '1212.5222', '1301.1228', '0707.2080', '1211.3663', '1210.8417', '1008.3901']}}
