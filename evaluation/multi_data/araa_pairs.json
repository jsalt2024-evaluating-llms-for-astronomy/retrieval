At this point a strong, quasi-stationary shock, HST-1, appears to form in the flow (\nFigure 1\n) and regularly ejects superluminal components (Cheung et al. 2007, Nakamura et al. 2010) at apparent speeds up to 6c (Biretta et al. 1999, Giroletti et al. 2012) before the jet slows and widens (\nFigure 3\n). The helical structure observed beyond HST-1 suggests that the magnetic field is still dynamically strong here (Asada & Nakamura 2012). A similar, stationary transition is observed near the component C7 in BL Lac. This is also at a deprojected radius \n\n and also creates superluminal components.\n",

    "question": " What have radio and \u03b3-ray correlation studies revealed about the locations of emission regions in AGN jets, and how do these findings impact our understanding of jet structure?",
    "text": "Both the Caltech 40-m and the MPIfR F-GAMMA studies found statistically significant correlations between the radio- and \u03b3-ray-flux density variations in some of the AGNs studied (Richards et al. 2011, Fuhrmann et al. 2014, Max-Moerbeck et al. 2014). In all such cases the centimeter-wavelength radio variations lagged behind the \u03b3-ray variations by about 100 days. The F-GAMMA results also showed that the lag decreases with wavelength, falling to zero by \n\n GHz. It is therefore clear that in some AGNs, the \u03b3-ray emission regions are indeed closer to the SMBH than the radio emission regions. However, there are also observations that show that in some AGNs, the \u03b3-ray and radio emission regions are colocated (Jorstad et al. 2001, Marscher et al. 2011, Jorstad & Marscher 2016, Rani et al. 2018). It appears, therefore, that \u03b3-ray emission from AGNs occurs at a variety of sites, some close to the SMBH and some close to the radio-emitting regions. Nalewajko et al. (2014) have presented an observational plan to locate the sites of synchrotron and Compton emission and argued that spine-sheath jet structure models are not a plausible alternative to external broad emission line photons.",

All four are transient magnetars, and their radio emission is transient too and associated with an X-ray outburst. In XTE J1810\u2212197 (the first detected radio-emitting magnetar), pulsations were observed after, but not before, its 2003 outburst. The radio pulsations disappeared in late 2008 with no prior secular decrease in radio flux (Camilo et al. 2016). Behavior in the other sources is similar (Camilo et al. 2007a, Levin et al. 2012). The persistent (i.e., nontransient) magnetars and several other transient magnetars have been searched for radio pulsations but with no detections (e.g., Lazarus et al. 2012, Tong et al. 2013b). In the four magnetars with confirmed radio pulsations, the radio emission in all cases is very bright and shows large pulse-to-pulse variability, with pulse morphologies, both single and average, that can be broad and that generally change enormously on timescales of minutes. They can be punctuated by spiky peaks that can be much shorter than the pulse period. This radio emission is also highly linearly polarized, with polarization fractions of 60\u2013100%. No evidence for a radio burst at the epoch of a GF has been seen (Tendulkar et al. 2016).",

    "question": " How do hard X-ray observations inform our understanding of energy release and particle acceleration in solar flares?",
    "text": "Based upon the discovery of hard X-ray emission at the beginning of a solar flare (Peterson & Winckler 1958) and its interpretation as nonthermal bremsstrahlung continuum from mildly relativistic electrons (Anderson & Winckler 1962), one could identify the loop heating as owing to the collisional losses of electrons injected by some unknown mechanism operating in the corona. From a coronal electron source, known to exist via the radio type III (fast drift) emission (e.g., Wild et al. 1963), one could imagine a thick-target region in the dense chromosphere for electrons projected downward, rather than upward as in a type III burst. The existence of the rare reverse-slope type III emission (Tarnstrom & Zehntner 1975) lends some support for this idea. This kind of model matches the idea of the Neupert effect (Neupert 1968), but one should note that this very common morphology would result from any impulsive heating mechanism. The hard X-ray continuum and the microwave gyrosynchrotron radiation tend to occur at the beginning of a flare (the impulsive phase). The Neupert effect neatly allows one to think of the coronal soft X-ray sources and chromospheric line emissions (H\u03b1) as showing the drastic evolution and heating of cool chromospheric mass injected (by evaporation) into coronal magnetic traps, where its soft X-ray emission constitutes the gradual phase of the flare.",

    "question": " What is the standard model for eruptive solar flares and CMEs, and how does it explain the observed phenomena?",
    "text": "By fits and starts, theorists began to concentrate on this behavior of eruptive flares, leading to the CSHKP picture (Carmichael 1964, Sturrock 1966, Hirayama 1974, Kopp & Pneuman 1976)\n4\n as summarized by Moore et al. (2001) and Shibata & Magara (2011), for example. In this scenario, the erupting solar magnetic field pushes coronal material out into the heliosphere as a CME, leaving a current sheet behind (a 2D manifold), as well as a flare arcade of hot X-ray-emitting loops that result when magnetic reconnection restores the closed field, leading eventually to the H\u03b1 loop prominence system. A 3D version of this model can incorporate a flux rope (e.g., Janvier et al. 2013), either formed during the eruption or perhaps preexisting as a part of the structure supporting the filament; in situ observations can detect this flux rope as a magnetic cloud (Burlaga et al. 1982) as it rises through the heliosphere.",

    "text": "Early X-ray observations of AGNs yielded soft X-ray spectra frequently showing the imprint of absorption from ionized gas, the warm absorber (WA) (Halpern 1984, Reynolds & Fabian 1995). More recent observations have found at least 50% of radio-quiet AGNs showing WAs in their soft X-ray (\u223c0.3\u20132 keV) spectra. The limited spectral resolution of the Einstein Observatory and Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA) observations prevented important parameters of the WAs, in particular the outflow velocity and mass rate, to be determined with useful precision. The higher resolution and high throughput afforded by contemporary X-ray observatories Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Suzaku has transformed that situation over the past decade, with the WA being shown, typically, to be dominated by K-shell ions of the lighter metals (C, N, O, etc.) and Fe-L, with outflow velocities of several hundred kilometers per second (Blustin et al. 2005, McKernan et al. 2007).",

(2010), Rupke & Veilleux (2011), and Sturm et al. (2011) find large-scale (kiloparsec) flows with v\nout\u223c1\u00d7103 km s\u22121 and \n\n year\u22121) in the nearby quasar Mrk 231. Other galaxies show similar phenomena (cf.

In each case it appears that AGN feedback is the driving agency. There is general agreement for Mrk 231, for example, that the mass outflow rate \n\n and the kinetic energy rate \n\n are too large to be driven by star formation but comparable with values predicted for AGN feedback.",

If defined strictly on the observed flux, the ULX population contains a small number of bright supernovae and supernova remnants.

    "question": " What are the key features and variations observed in low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) detected in ultraluminous X-ray sources?",
    "text": "Low-frequency QPOs and timing features such as the low-frequency break in the continuum noise have been reported only for a small number of ULXs owing to the large photon statistics needed and the fact that many ULXs have little fast variability. The first QPO detection was from M82 (Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003) and was later localized to M82 X-1 (Feng & Kaaret 2007). Additional observations revealed shifts in the QPO frequency in the range of 34\u2013120 mHz and a flat-topped continuum component with a low-frequency break around 34 mHz (Dewangan et al. 2006, Mucciarelli et al. 2006, Caballero-Garc\u00eda et al. 2013a). The low-frequency noise and QPOs disappeared in three deep XMM-Newton observations, suggesting a change in the accretion state of M82 X-1 (Feng & Kaaret 2010; see Section 6). NGC 5408 X-1 shows strong timing noise (Soria et al. 2004), a low-frequency break at a few millihertz, and QPOs with varying frequency in the 10\u201320-mHz range (Strohmayer 2009). Low-frequency QPOs around 33 and 80 mHz, above the break of a flat-topped noise component, were detected in NGC 1313 X-1 (Pasham et al. 2015). Rao et al. (2010) reported QPOs at 8.5 mHz above a continuum break near 3 mHz in NGC 6946 X-1. An integrated variation amplitude of 60% in the frequency range of 1\u2013100 mHz makes it one of the most variable ULXs.",

    "question": " How do supercritical accretion models interpret the two-component spectra observed in brighter ultraluminous X-ray sources?",
    "text": "The two-component spectra of brighter ULXs have been physically interpreted via supercritical accretion models, with the soft component being emission from the inner photosphere within the outflowing wind (King & Pounds 2003, Poutanen et al. 2007) and the hard component being the hot, inner disk emission (Middleton et al. 2011a, Kajava et al. 2012). This differs from the original interpretation of the two-component UL spectra discussed in Section 2.2. The luminosity of the soft/wind component is then predicted to decrease with increasing temperature (Poutanen et al. 2007), in strong contrast with the expected behavior of a disk. As discussed in Section 2.5, the soft component of ULX spectra fitted with two-component models generally shows decreasing luminosity, both total and in the soft component, with increasing temperature (Feng & Kaaret 2007), with a relationship L\u221dT\n\u22123.5 (Kajava & Poutanen 2009).",

    "text": "The presence of spiral arms is observed to correlate with an enhancement in star-formation rate (SFR), and spirals may trigger and/or concentrate star formation (SF; Roberts 1969, Kim et al. 2020). It has long been noted that the average SF properties of galaxies vary systematically along the classic Hubble spiral sequence (Kennicutt 1998a), with later spirals having more gas and enhanced SF relative to earlier spirals. Hart et al. (2017a), in agreement with early work (e.g., Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1982), also note a link, with flocculent spirals tending to be bluer than grand design spirals, but they conclude the overall SFRs are similar. The star-formation efficiency (SFE) can be used to distinguish enhanced SF due to increased gas density from an enhancement of the SFR relative to density: Studies of the SFE of disks suggest it does not vary much from arm to interarm (Foyle et al. 2010), although Yu et al. (2021) demonstrate a correlation of SFE (or gas depletion timescales) with spiral arm strength in a large sample.",

    "question": " What observational evidence indicates that silicate grains are aligned while carbon grains are not aligned in the interstellar medium?",
    "text": "The strong polarization seen in the 9.7-\u03bcm and 18-\u03bcm silicate spectral features (Smith et al. 2000) shows that silicate grains are aligned. In contrast, sensitive searches for polarization in the 3.4-\u03bcm line of the aliphatic C\u2212H stretch mode do not show detectable polarization (e.g., Chiar et al. 2006). As a result of the exposure to atomic hydrogen and UV photons, such surface groups are expected to be present on all forms of carbonaceous dust in the diffuse ISM (Chiar et al. 2013 and references therein). Thus, the lack of polarization in this spectral feature indicates that carbon grains are not aligned. This is supported by the fact that in models of the FIR-to-submillimeter polarization spectra by Draine & Fraisse (2009), only those assuming spherical carbon grains (equivalent to nonalignment) match the observations (Vaillancourt & Matthews 2012; Section 3.5). The spectral dependence of the submillimeter-to-millimeter polarization determined by the Planck project is also consistent with this interpretation (Planck Collab. XXII 2015). Additionally, comparisons of linear and circular polarization in the ISM indicate that the grains responsible for the polarization are good dielectrics (Martin 1974, Martin & Angel 1976, Mathis 1986). This is a characteristic consistent with silicate dust but not with carbonaceous grains.",

    "text": "\nGoodman & Dickson (1998) noted that the dynamical tide in a star similar to the present Sun, forced by a binary companion in an eccentric orbit, can easily exceed the breaking amplitude in the innermost wavelengths near the stellar center and is then bound to be significantly damped. In fact, the level of nonlinearity in the wave increases strongly toward the center because of the concentration of the wave energy into a small volume. Ogilvie & Lin (2007) applied a similar idea to the host stars of hot Jupiters, where the stellar rotation is slow compared to the orbit and the eccentricity is negligible; they found that, for a model based on the present Sun, a companion of more than about three Jupiter masses would generate waves that could break near the center, but also noted that the threshold depends on the stellar model. More detailed calculations were made by Barker & Ogilvie (2010), who also performed numerical simulations of the breaking process. Among solar-type stars, the threshold companion mass decreases with increasing stellar mass and with increasing age. Older or more massive stars have a steeper stratification near the center because of their chemical evolution.",

    "question": " What evidence exists for tidal circularization in binary star systems, and how well do theoretical models explain the observed circularization timescales?",
    "text": "Indirect evidence of tidal dissipation in stars and giant planets comes from a comparison of the observed distributions of orbital and spin parameters with the expected outcomes of tidal evolution, given reasonable assumptions about the initial conditions. For spectroscopic binary stars, the measured joint distribution of orbital eccentricity e and orbital period P provides good evidence for tidal circularization, showing a clear preference for smaller e at small P. The most detailed study is that of Meibom & Mathieu (2005; see also Mathieu 2005), who plot e versus P for eight populations of solar-type binaries of different ages from pre-main-sequence to late-main-sequence and define a characteristic circularization period (below which orbits are more circular) for each based on a fit to the distribution. The circularization period generally increases with age, suggestive of ongoing tidal dissipation, in a way that is very roughly consistent with Q\u2032\u2248106 (Ogilvie & Lin 2007; see also Hansen 2010, discussed in Section 5.3 below). It is clear from \nFigure 5\n that convective damping of the equilibrium tide in a star similar to the present Sun is much too inefficient to explain this result, even with optimistic assumptions (Q\u2032\u22481010 being a more reasonable estimate). (It should be noted that the primary stars span a range of masses around 1M\u2299, and that the secondary stars, which might make an important or even dominant contribution to circularization, are mostly not observed.) If the stars are assumed to be synchronized, then the frequencies of the first-order eccentricity tides (\nTable 1\n) in the fluid frame are \n\n (\nFigure 2\n) and can excite inertial waves in the convective zone. Studies of the dynamical tide in a solar model can then explain Q\u2032\u2248107\u2013108 (Ogilvie & Lin 2007), but this is still too inefficient to explain the observations. Witte & Savonije (2002) found that the dynamical tide in the radiative zone, together with the effects of rotation and resonant locking, could also provide much more dissipation than the equilibrium tide, but still not enough to explain the observations. A gap still exists, therefore, between theory and observations in this area. [Zahn & Bouchet (1989) previously argued on theoretical grounds that most of the circularization occurs during the pre-main-sequence phase, when the stars are larger and fully convective, but the observations do imply an ongoing process.]",

Bouabid et al. (2013), Van Reeth et al. (2016), and Ouazzani et al. (2017) showed how the slope of points in the \u0394P \u2212 P diagram measures the interior rotation rate. The slopes differ for series of prograde sectoral, zonal, and retrograde sectoral dipole modes (Ouazzani et al. 2017, their figure 2), and all series are useful. The prograde modes are most common and in many cases dozens of consecutive radial overtone modes are detected, particularly in the 4-year Kepler data in which the frequency resolution is the best to date. Ouazzani et al. (2019, their figure 5) showed good agreement between the internal rotation rates determined by Cunha et al. (2020) and Van Reeth et al.

    "text": "The massive outer disk at \u223c20\u201330 AU was also the source of various Kuiper belt object (KBO) populations (Section 10), indicating that Jupiter Trojans and KBOs are siblings. Indeed, they share the same SFD with a break at \u2243100 km (Adams et al. 2014, Fraser et al. 2014). The bulk density of Patroclus and Hector, both Jupiter's Trojans, was determined to be \u03c1=0.8\u20131 g cm\u22123 (Marchis et al. 2014, Buie et al. 2015), which is suggestive of high H2O-ice content and/or high porosity. The Patroclus and (18974) 1998 WR21 equal-size binaries are probably rare survivors of a much larger population of binaries in the outer disk (most binaries were presumably dissociated by collisions and planetary encounters). In summary, Jupiter Trojans may represent the most readily accessible repository of Kuiper belt material. The NASA Lucy mission, to be launched in 2021, will explore this connection (Levison et al. 2016).",

    "question": " What specific conditions are required for Saturn's obliquity to be excited by capture in the p6=s8 spin-orbit resonance during late planetary migration?",
    "text": "\nVokrouhlick\u00fd & Nesvorn\u00fd (2015) found that Saturn's obliquity can indeed be excited by capture in the p\n6=s\n8 spin-orbit resonance (Ward & Hamilton 2004, Hamilton & Ward 2004, Bou\u00e9 et al. 2009) during the late stages of planetary migration. To reproduce the current orientation of Saturn's spin vector, however, specific conditions must be met (\nFigure 11\n). First, Neptune's late-stage migration must be slow with 100<\u03c4<200 Myr. Fast migration rates with \u03c4<100 Myr do not work because the resonant capture and excitation of \u03b86 do not happen.\n5\n Second, for Saturn to remain in the p\n6=s\n8 resonance today, \u03b16<0.8 arcsec year\u22121, which is lower than the estimate derived from modeling of Saturn's interior (\u03b16=0.845 arcsec year\u22121; Helled et al. 2009). Interestingly, direct measurements of the mean precession rate of Saturn's spin axis suggest \u03b16=0.81\u00b10.05 arcsec year\u22121 (see discussion in Vokrouhlick\u00fd & Nesvorn\u00fd 2015), which would allow for \u03b16<0.8 arcsec year\u22121 within the quoted uncertainty.\n",

    "question": " How do photometric redshifts impact large-scale structure measurements, particularly for studies of clustering amplitude and baryonic acoustic oscillations?",
    "text": "The clustering of galaxies is a probe both of the amplitude of density fluctuations (when joined with lensing; e.g., Baldauf et al. 2010) and of the scale of baryonic acoustic oscillations (BAOs). Large-scale structure measurements can be performed either by simply measuring angular clustering in photo-z slices (e.g., S\u00e1nchez et al. 2011, Carnero et al. 2012, DES Collab. 2021b) or, for more sensitive results, by using photo-z estimates (or PDFs) for individual objects (e.g., Padmanabhan et al. 2007, Seo et al. 2012, Zhou et al. 2021). The observed amplitude of angular clustering will depend directly on the redshift distribution of the galaxy sample. As was the case for clustering-based studies of galaxy evolution, increasing the performance of photo-zs will improve the SNR for cosmological large-scale structure studies. Characterization of the width of the ensemble redshift distribution is particularly important for minimizing systematic uncertainties in measurements of the clustering amplitude (e.g., Cawthon et al. 2020), while characterization of the mean redshift will be more important for constraints on the BAO distance scale.",

    "question": " What novel sources of resonant excitation have been discovered in Saturn's rings, and how do they provide insight into planetary interiors?",
    "text": "\nHedman et al. (2010) have characterized the gaps and edges in the Cassini division in great detail. They suggest that most of the structures arise in response to disturbances in the massive outer edge of the B ring that librate relative to the 2:1 forcing by Mimas. An equally novel source of resonant gravitational excitation of spiral density waves, not in the Cassini division but in Saturn's C ring, is low-order normal-mode oscillations of Saturn, as predicted by Marley (1991) and Marley & Porco (1993). Using stellar occultation measurements from the Cassini spacecraft, Hedman & Nicholson (2013) find six sets of density waves with m=2 and m=4 in the C ring that have pattern speeds too large to be associated with any satellite resonance. Assuming that the planetary oscillations are excited stochastically, the authors use the behavior of the waves to constrain, in a preliminary fashion, the damping constant of the planetary oscillations. Coupled with better calculations of the density wave amplitude in the density waves in the C ring, the method promises to give an exciting new way to extract information about Saturn's interior. Finally, to add variety as to possible mechanisms, Hedman & Showalter (2015) argue that a transient bending wave in Saturn's D ring may have occurred by a ring impact.",

We can see its use in Saha & Williams (1994) who applied it to extract galaxy kinematics from absorption line spectra. Further seeds were planted down the line by Christensen & Meyer (1998) while studying gravitational wave radiation, and then by Christensen et al. (2001) and Knox et al. (2001) in the context of cosmological parameter estimation using cosmic microwave background data. Inspired by these papers, Lewis & Bridle (2002) more than any other paper seems to have galvanized the astronomy community in the use of Bayesian and MCMC techniques. They laid out in detail the Bayesian-MCMC framework, applied it to one of the most important data sets of the time (cosmic background radiation) and used it to address a significant scientific question\u2014the fundamental parameters of our Universe. Additionally, they made their MCMC code publicly available, which was instrumental in lowering the barrier for new entrants to the field.",

    "question": " How are solar-like oscillations in stars characterized and what can they reveal about stellar properties and Galactic evolution?",
    "text": "Solar-like oscillations, which are excited and damped in the outer convective envelopes of a star, are seen in stars like the Sun and red giants. With the advent of space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT that provide high-quality photometric data over a long time series, it has now become feasible to detect solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of stars (Stello et al. 2013, 2015). Typically, the power spectrum of a star with solar-like oscillations (\nFigure 10) shows a regular pattern of modes, characterized by a large frequency separation \u0394\u03bd. The overall amplitude is modulated by a Gaussian envelope, and this is characterized by the frequency of maximum oscillation \u03bdmax. Theory suggests that \u0394\u03bd for a given star is related to its density (Ulrich 1986), whereas the \u03bdmax is related to its surface gravity and temperature (Brown et al. 1991, Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). Using the above two relations, the mass and the radius of a star can be constrained. The mass of a red giant is sensitive to its age, and this makes asteroseismology very useful for understanding Galactic evolution (Chaplin et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2016). For further details on solar-type oscillations see the review by Chaplin & Miglio (2013).\n",

    "question": " How does catastrophic quenching affect the \u03b1 effect in dynamo theory, and how is it related to magnetic helicity conservation?",
    "text": "The term catastrophic quenching was coined by Blackman & Field (2000) to denote any type of detrimental ReM dependence of the nonlinear feedback. Ignoring the effect of turbulent diffusion (i.e., the term \n\n in Equation 4), Cattaneo & Hughes (1996) found that numerically \n\n, where \n\n is the equipartition field strength, whose energy density is equal to the kinetic energy density. Evidently, owing to the ReM factor in the expression for \u03b1, this dependence is catastrophic. This dependence was originally anticipated by Vainshtein & Cattaneo (1992) on the basis of earlier analogous results by Cattaneo & Vainshtein (1991) for the suppression of just \u03b7t in two dimensions. Gruzinov & Diamond (1996) explained these results as a consequence of the conservation of magnetic helicity \n\n in three dimensions, which is routinely seen during laboratory plasma relaxation (Ji et al. 1995). However, the dependence of \u03b1 on ReM is a peculiar property of the magnetic helicity equation in the presence of an imposed magnetic field \n\n. In that case, the magnetic helicity corresponding to the departure from the imposed field, \n\n, yields, in the steady state, \n\n. Since we define mean fields here as volume averages, and since \n\n in Equation 4, we have \n\n, and therefore \n\n, so \u03b1 \u2192 0 as \u03b7 \u2192 0 or ReM \u2192 \u221e. This agrees with the heuristic quenching formula \n\n, which also predicts \u03b1 \u2192 0 as ReM \u2192 \u221e. The analysis also shows that the quenching is related to magnetic helicity conservation. A detailed explanation of this derivation is reviewed in Brandenburg & Subramanian (2005a).",

    "question": " What are the current models and observational constraints for the large-scale magnetic field structure of the Milky Way?",
    "text": "Classifying the Milky Way's magnetic field structure is much harder. The existing parametric models of the Galactic magnetic field are based largely on full-sky RM maps of extragalactic sources (e.g., Oppermann et al. 2015, Hutschenreuter et al. 2022) and synchrotron emission maps of the Milky Way (mainly from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe; see Page et al. 2007, Bennett et al. 2013) (see also \nFigure 11\n). The model of Sun et al. (2008) assumes an ASS with a reversal in the inner 5 kpc. Jansson & Farrar (2012) include magnetic spiral arms and an X-shaped field in the halo (see also Section 6.5 for the observational motivation). Jaffe et al. (2010) also fit magnetic spiral arms to the disk data, also including the random magnetic field component. Using analytic forms for the 3D field, Terral & Ferri\u00e8re (2017) concluded that a bisymmetric (m = 1) halo field best fits the RM data. However, West et al. (2020) found evidence for an axisymmetric (m = 0) quadrupolar magnetic field with a small net vertical component in the RM. A newer analysis (Dickey et al. 2022) shows that a combination of an axisymmetric mode and a bisymmetric mode, based on analytical galactic dynamo models from Henriksen et al. (2018), best explains the large-scale morphology of the Galactic RM data. As the quality of the observational data improves, a complex picture of galactic magnetic field morphology emerges, including that of the Milky Way.\n",

    "text": "At long radio wavelengths, the synchrotron emission from even just a uniform magnetic field suffers depolarization from the superposition of Faraday-rotated contributions. However, if the magnetic field is helical, the polarized intensity can either enhance the depolarization if helicity and RM have opposite signs or cancel it if they have the same sign (Brandenburg & Stepanov 2014, Horellou & Fletcher 2014). This leads to a correlation between polarized intensity and RM (Volegova & Stepanov 2010), which has now been used by West et al. (2020) to characterize the Galactic magnetic helicity. Future observations with the Square Kilometer Array are expected to reveal much more detailed information on magnetic helicity using a continuous band of wavelengths (Beck et al. 2015).",

    "question": " What is the WSA model and how does it explain the relationship between solar wind speed and coronal magnetic field topology?",
    "text": "Despite the difficulties in associating solar wind streams with specific coronal sources, there is a well-established empirical relationship between the speed of a parcel of solar wind at 1 AU and the inferred topological behavior of its approximate magnetic footpoint. Levine et al. (1977) and Wang & Sheeley (1990) discovered an inverse correlation between the wind speed and the degree of superradial flux-tube expansion (i.e., the amount of trumpet-like growth of an area traced out by the tips of field lines in a compact bundle) between the photosphere and a reference point at a radial distance of about 2.5 \n\n. This relationship, together with subsequent refinements (see also Arge & Pizzo 2000, Riley et al. 2015), is typically called the WSA model (after Wang, Sheeley & Arge), and it has evolved into an integral part of modern-day operational space-weather forecasting. Kovakenko (1981) and Wang & Sheeley (1991) proposed independently that the physical origin of this effect is related to the existence of Alfv\u00e9n waves at the coronal base. Consider a situation in which the upward energy flux of waves is the same at every point on the solar surface. A parcel of plasma up in the corona with a low superradial expansion factor collects wave energy from a larger patch of the surface than does a parcel of the same size associated with a high superradial expansion factor. Thus, the low-expansion regions have the most vigorous waves and turbulent fluctuations, the most wave-driven coronal heating, and thus the most intense solar wind acceleration. It is probably no coincidence that the central regions of coronal holes exhibit the lowest superradial expansion factors.",

    "question": " What are the typical observational characteristics of propagating slow magnetoacoustic waves in the solar corona, and how are they detected?",
    "text": "Compressive propagating coronal slow waves are usually associated with quasi-periodic EUV and soft X-ray intensity perturbations that move upward along field-aligned plasma nonuniformities. They are observed, in particular, with the high-resolution imaging telescopes. These propagating quasi-periodic disturbances typically have small amplitudes of a few percent of the background intensity, with periods in the range of 2\u201310 min and propagation speeds of \u223c70\u2013235 km s\u22121, which are comparable with the local sound speed. These waves are observed to decay quickly with height and with the decay length of a few tens of millions of meters. Routine observations demonstrated omnipresence of this phenomenon, occurring in both the plume and interplume regions in polar coronal holes (e.g., Gupta et al. 2010), legs of long fan-like loops in active regions (see \nFigure 4\n and Yuan & Nakariakov 2012), and also in plume-like structures in equatorial coronal holes and quiet Sun regions (e.g., Tian et al. 2011, Krishna Prasad et al. 2012b). These waves could be also detected spectroscopically, as Doppler shift variations and emission enhancements in the blue wing of the emission line (e.g., Verwichte et al. 2010), manifesting the in-phase behavior of the velocity and density perturbations. For comprehensive reviews of earlier observational results on the detection of propagating slow waves in coronal loops and holes, readers are referred to, e.g., De Moortel (2009) and Banerjee et al. (2011). Discussion of an alternative interpretation for the propagating EUV disturbances, in terms of quasi-periodic upflows, and its constructive criticism based on the comparison to the wave-related explanation are given by Wang (2016).\n",

    "text": "For many years, the only known low-redshift strong-lens system was Q2237+0305, the Einstein Cross (Huchra et al. 1985). In this case, the lensing galaxy is a barred spiral with \u03c3 \u2248 165 km s\u22121, at z = 0.038, and analysis yields a total Einstein-aperture M/L that is too small to be consistent with a Salpeter or heavier IMF (Ferreras et al. 2010), even assuming no contribution from DM. Smith et al. (2005) discovered the first low-redshift elliptical galaxy known to act as a strong lens. ESO325\u2013G004, at z = 0.034, images a background galaxy into a partial Einstein ring, providing a very robust measurement of the mass projected inside a radius of 1.9 kpc (\u223c0.25 R\neff). With a high velocity dispersion (\u03c3 \u223c300 km s\u22121), absence of any apparent ongoing star formation, negligible rotation, and \u03b1-enhanced abundance pattern, this galaxy is typical of the objects found in other studies to have a (bottom-)heavy IMF. However, Smith & Lucey (2013) showed that the lensing mass implies \u03a8 to be consistent with a MW IMF (\u03b1lens = 1.04 \u00b1 0.15). They assumed a theoretically motivated estimate for the projected DM contribution, but this is a small correction (15%) due to the small projected Einstein radius, and even attributing all mass to the stars yields a sub-Salpeter \u03b1 factor. Three further low-z early-type lens galaxies have since been discovered (Smith et al. 2015, Collier et al. 2018). After corrections for the likely projected DM content, based on cosmological simulations, all of these galaxies have \u03b1 consistent with a MW IMF, on \u223c2-kpc scales. Efforts are underway to enlarge the samples of low-redshift strong lenses (Talbot et al. 2018, Collier et al. 2020). The approach can be augmented with upper limits on \u03b1 from galaxies with close-projected but singly imaged background galaxies, when unambiguous limits on counter-images can be established (Smith et al. 2018).",

    "question": " How does the two-phase formation scenario for massive early-type galaxies potentially explain observed radial variations in their initial mass functions?",
    "text": "CONNECTION TO THE TWO-PHASE GALAXY FORMATION SCENARIOEvidence from both observations and simulations seems to support a two-phase scenario for the formation of massive ETGs (Oser et al. 2010). In this picture, an early phase of in situ star formation (Barro et al. 2013) leads to a population of initially compact (1\u20132 kpc) but massive (\u223c1011 M\u2299) quiescent galaxies at z\n\n\n 1.5 (Trujillo et al. 2006), which later grow by accreting stars that formed elsewhere, through minor mergers (Belli et al. 2014). The similarity in size-scale with the radial extent of the IMF variations in massive ETGs (\n\n2 kpc, e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2017, La Barbera et al. 2019) tempts speculation that the IMF signal is linked specifically to the surviving stars from the in situ formation phase, which are thought still to dominate the innermost regions (<0.1 R\neff) of their descendent galaxies at z = 0 (e.g., Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016). This picture finds support in some rare relic galaxies at low redshift that are thought to have suffered little accretion after the initial phase, and which indeed seem to exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs at all radii (Ferr\u00e9-Mateu et al. 2017).",
