Multiwavelength imaging surveys with the Hubble (HST) and Spitzer space telescopes and ground-based facilities, together with spectroscopic follow-up with 8-m-class telescopes, have led to the discovery of galaxies with confirmed redshifts as large as z = 7.5 (Finkelstein et al. 2013) as well as compelling photometric candidates as far back as z\u224811 (Coe et al. 2013) when the Universe was only 3% of its current age. Following the seminal work of Steidel et al. (1996), color-selection criteria that are sensitive to the presence of intergalactic Hi absorption features in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of distant sources have been used to build increasingly large samples of star-forming galaxies at 2.5\u2272z\u22729 (e.g., Madau et al. 1996, Steidel et al. 2003, Giavalisco et al. 2004a, Bouwens et al. 2011b). Infrared (IR)-optical color selection criteria efficiently isolate both actively star-forming and passively evolving galaxies at z\u22482 (Franx et al. 2003, Daddi et al. 2004). Photometric redshifts have become an unavoidable tool for placing faint galaxies onto a cosmic timeline. Spitzer, Herschel, and submillimeter telescopes have revealed that dusty galaxies with star-formation rates (SFRs) of order 100M\u2299 year\u22121 or more were abundant when the Universe was only 2\u20133 Gyr old (Barger et al. 1998, Daddi et al. 2005, Gruppioni et al. 2013). Deep near-infrared (NIR) observations are now commonly used to select galaxies on the basis of their optical rest-frame light and to chart the evolution of the global stellar mass density (SMD) at 0<z<3 (Dickinson et al. 2003). The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite has quantified the UV galaxy luminosity function (LF) of galaxies in the local Universe and its evolution at z\u22721. Ground-based observations and, subsequently, UV and IR data from GALEX and Spitzer have confirmed that star-formation activity was significantly higher in the past (Lilly et al. 1996, Le Floc'h et al. 2005, Schiminovich et al. 2005). In the local Universe, various galaxy properties (colors, surface mass densities, and concentrations) have been observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to be \u201cbimodal\u201d around a transitional stellar mass of 3\u00d71010M\u2299 (Kauffmann et al. 2003), showing a clear division between faint, blue, active galaxies and bright, red, passive systems. The number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies appear to have remained nearly constant since z\u223c1, whereas those of red galaxies (around L\u2217) have been rising (Faber et al. 2007). At redshifts 0<z<2 at least, and perhaps earlier, most star-forming galaxies are observed to obey a relatively tight \u201cmain-sequence\u201d correlation between their SFRs and stellar masses (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority of starburst galaxies have elevated SFRs above this main sequence as well as a growing population of quiescent galaxies that fall below it.", "With the avalanche of new data, galaxy taxonomy has been enriched by the addition of new acronyms such as LBGs, LAEs, EROs, BzKs, DRGs, DOGs, LIRGs, ULIRGs, and SMGs. Making sense of it all and fitting it together into a coherent picture remain one of astronomy's great challenges, in part because of the observational difficulty of tracking continuously transforming galaxy subpopulations across cosmic time and in part because theory provides only a partial interpretative framework. The key idea of standard cosmological scenarios is that primordial density fluctuations grow by gravitational instability driven by cold, collisionless dark matter, leading to a \u201cbottom-up\u201d \u039bCDM (cold dark matter) scenario of structure formation (Peebles 1982). Galaxies form hierarchically: Low-mass objects (\u201chalos\u201d) collapse earlier and merge to form increasingly larger systems over time\u2014from ultrafaint dwarfs to clusters of galaxies (Blumenthal et al. 1984). Ordinary matter in the Universe follows the dynamics dictated by the dark matter until radiative, hydrodynamic, and star-formation processes take over (White & Rees 1978). The \u201cdark side\u201d of galaxy formation can be modeled with high accuracy and has been explored in detail through N-body numerical simulations of increasing resolution and size (e.g., Davis et al. 1985; Dubinski & Carlberg 1991; Moore et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2005, 2008; Diemand et al. 2008; Stadel et al. 2009; Klypin et al. 2011). However, the same does not hold for the baryons. Several complex processes are still poorly understood, for example, baryonic dissipation inside evolving CDM halos, the transformation of cold gas into stars, the formation of disks and spheroids, the chemical enrichment of gaseous material on galactic and intergalactic scales, and the role played by \u201cfeedback\u201d [the effect of the energy input from stars, supernovae (SNe), and massive black holes on their environment] in regulating star formation and generating galactic outflows. The purely phenomenological treatment of complex physical processes that is at the core of semianalytic schemes of galaxy formation (e.g., White & Frenk 1991, Kauffmann et al. 1993, Somerville & Primack 1999, Cole et al. 2000) and\u2014at a much higher level of realism\u2014the \u201csubgrid modeling\u201d of star formation and stellar feedback that must be implemented even in the more accurate cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Katz et al. 1996, Yepes et al. 1997, Navarro & Steinmetz 2000, Springel & Hernquist 2003, Keres et al. 2005, Ocvirk et al. 2008, Governato et al. 2010, Guedes et al. 2011, Hopkins et al. 2012, Kuhlen et al. 2012, Zemp et al. 2012, Agertz et al. 2013) are sensitive to poorly determined parameters and suffer from various degeneracies, a weakness that has traditionally prevented robust predictions to be made in advance of specific observations.", "Ideally, an in-depth understanding of galaxy evolution would encompass the full sequence of events that led from the formation of the first stars after the end of the cosmic dark ages to the present-day diversity of forms, sizes, masses, colors, luminosities, metallicities, and clustering properties of galaxies. This is a daunting task, and it is perhaps not surprising that an alternative way to look at and interpret the bewildering variety of galaxy data has become very popular in the past two decades. The method focuses on the emission properties of the galaxy population as a whole, traces the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density from the far-UV (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR), and offers the prospect of an empirical determination of the global history of star formation and heavy element production of the Universe, independently of the complex evolutionary phases of individual galaxy subpopulations. The modern version of this technique relies on some basic properties of stellar populations and dusty starburst galaxies:", "By modeling the emission history of all stars in the Universe at UV, optical, and IR wavelengths from the present epoch to z\u22488 and beyond, one can then shed light on some key questions in galaxy formation and evolution studies: Is there a characteristic cosmic epoch of the formation of stars and heavy elements in galaxies? What fraction of the luminous baryons observed today were already locked into galaxies at early times? Are the data consistent with a universal IMF? Do galaxies reionize the Universe at a redshift greater than 6? Can we account for all the metals produced by the global star-formation activity from the Big Bang to the present? How does the cosmic history of star formation compare with the history of mass accretion onto massive black holes as traced by luminous quasars?", "This review focuses on the range of observations, methods, and theoretical tools that are allowing astronomers to map the rate of transformation of gas into stars in the Universe, from the cosmic dark ages to the present epoch. Given the limited space available, it is impossible to provide a thorough survey of such a huge community effort without leaving out significant contributions or whole subfields. We have therefore tried to refer only briefly to earlier findings and present recent observations in more detail, limiting the number of studies cited and highlighting key research areas. In doing so, we hope to provide a manageable overview of how the field has developed and matured in line with new technological advances and theoretical insights and of the questions with which astronomers still struggle nowadays.", "The remainder of this review is organized as follows: The equations of cosmic chemical evolution that govern the consumption of gas into stars and the formation and dispersal of heavy elements in the Universe as a whole are given in Section 2. We turn to the topic of measuring mass from light and draw attention to areas of uncertainty in Section 3. Large surveys, key data sets, and the analyses thereof are highlighted in Section 4. An up-to-date determination of the star-formation history (SFH) of the Universe is provided and its main implications are discussed in Section 5. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 6. Unless otherwise stated, all results presented here will assume a \u201ccosmic concordance cosmology\u201d with parameters (\u03a9\nM\n, \u03a9\u039b, \u03a9\nb\n, h)=(0.3, 0.7, 0.045, 0.7).", "To pursue and cast light into a quantitative form of the idea of a history of cosmic star formation and metal enrichment\u2014not of any particular type of galaxy but of the Universe as a whole\u2014it is useful to start by generalizing the standard equations of galaxy evolution (Tinsley 1980) over all galaxies and intergalactic gas in the Universe. In a representative cosmological comoving volume with density \u03c1\u2217 in long-lived stars and stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars, black holes) and gas density \u03c1\ng\n and in which new stars are formed at the rate \u03c8, the equations of cosmic chemical evolution can be written as", "\n", "", "Here, Z is the metallicity in the gas and newly born stars, R is the \u201creturn fraction\u201d or the mass fraction of each generation of stars that is put back into the interstellar medium (ISM) and intergalactic medium (IGM), and y is the net metal yield or the mass of new heavy elements created and ejected into the ISM/IGM by each generation of stars per unit mass locked into stars. The above equations govern the formation, destruction, and distribution of heavy elements as they cycle through stars and are ultimately dispersed into the ISM/IGM. By treating all galaxies as a single stellar system and all baryons in the ISM/IGM as its gas reservoir, their solution enables the mean trends of galaxy populations to be calculated with the fewest number of free parameters. The equations state that, for every new mass element locked forever into long-lived stars and stellar remnants, \u0394\u03c1\u2217, the metallicity of the ISM/IGM increases as \u0394Z=y\u0394\u03c1\u2217/\u03c1\ng\n, whereas the mass of heavy elements in the ISM/IGM changes as \u0394(Z\u03c1\ng\n)=(y\u2212Z)\u0394\u03c1\u2217. The latter expression is a consequence of metals being released into the gas from mass loss during post-main-sequence stellar evolution as well as being removed from the ISM/IGM when new stars condense out. However, compared with the source term, the metal sink term can be neglected at early epochs when Z\u226ay.", "At redshift z, Equation 1 can be integrated to give the following:", "For a given universal stellar IMF, the quantities R and y can be derived using the following formulas:", "\n", "", "\n", "", "where m is mass of a star, wm\n is its remnant mass, \u03d5(m) is the IMF [normalized so that \n\n], and ym\n is the stellar yield, i.e., the fraction of mass m that is converted to metals and ejected. (In this review, the term \u201cyield\u201d generally indicates the net yield y of a stellar population as defined in Equation 7; instead, we explicitly speak of \u201cstellar yields\u201d to indicate the ym\n resulting from nucleosynthesis calculations.) The above equations have been written under the simplifying assumptions of \u201cinstantaneous recycling\u201d (where the release and mixing of the products of nucleosynthesis by all stars more massive than m\n0 occur on a timescale that is much shorter than the Hubble time, whereas stars with m<m\n0 live forever), \u201cone zone\u201d (where the heavy elements are well mixed at all times within the volume under consideration), \u201cclosed box\u201d (flows of gas in and out of the chosen volume are negligible), and \u201cconstant IMF and metal yield.\u201d", "Recall now that the main-sequence timescale is shorter than 0.6 Gyr (the age of the Universe at z = 8.5) for stars more massive than 2.5M\u2299, whereas stars less massive than 0.9M\u2299 never evolve off the main sequence. [Stellar evolutionary models by Schaller et al. (1992) show that, for m<7M\u2299, solar-metallicity stars have longer lifetimes than their metal-poor counterparts, whereas the opposite is true for m>9M\u2299.] So over the redshift range of interest here, the instantaneous recycling approximation may break down in the limited mass range 0.9<m<2.5M\u2299. For illustrative purposes, in the following we adopt the initial-final mass values for white dwarfs tabulated by Weidemann (2000), which can be fit to few-percent accuracy over the interval 1M\u2299<m<7M\u2299 as wm\n=0.444+0.084m. We also assume that all stars with 8M\u2299<m<m\nBH=40M\u2299 return all but a wm\n=1.4M\u2299 remnant, and stars above m\nBH collapse to black holes without ejecting material into space, i.e., wm\n=m. Few stars form with masses above 40M\u2299, so the impact of the latter simplifying assumption on chemical evolution is minimal. Thus, taking m\n0=1M\u2299 as the dividing stellar mass for instantaneous recycling and a Salpeter (1955) IMF with \u03d5(m)\u221dm\n\u22122.35 in the range ml\n=0.1M\u2299<m<mu\n=100M\u2299, one derives a return fraction of R = 0.27. Under the same assumptions, a Chabrier (2003) IMF,", "\n", "", "(with mc\n=0.08M\u2299 and \u03c3=0.69) is more weighted toward short-lived massive stars and yields a larger return fraction, R = 0.41. In the instantaneous recycling approximation, the fraction of \u201cdark\u201d stellar remnants formed in each generation is", "\n", "", "The two IMFs produce a dark remnant mass fraction of D = 0.12 and D = 0.19, respectively. The stellar nucleosynthetic yields depend on metallicity, rotation, and the mass limit for black hole formation m\nBH. By integrating over the IMF the subsolar metallicity stellar yields (where the effect of mass loss is negligible) tabulated by Maeder (1992) from 10M\u2299 to m\nBH=40M\u2299, we obtain y = 0.016 for a Salpeter and y = 0.032 for a Chabrier IMF. When integrated to m\nBH=60M\u2299, the same tabulation implies y = 0.023 (with R = 0.29) and y = 0.048 (with R = 0.44) for a Salpeter and Chabrier IMF, respectively. Notice that some of the uncertainties associated with the IMF and the mass cutoff m\nBH become smaller when computing the term y(1\u2212R) in the equations (Equation 1). For massive stars at solar metallicities, stellar winds eject large amounts of helium and carbon into the ISM before these are processed into heavier elements, but the effect on the integrated metal yields (10\u221240M\u2299) is weak (Maeder 1992). Total stellar yields (including the wind and pre-SN contributions) obtained from rotating stellar models at solar metallicity have been presented by Hirschi et al. (2005). Over the same range 10\u221240M\u2299, in this case we derive y = 0.019 for Salpeter and y = 0.038 for Chabrier. For comparison, the zero-metallicity stellar yields of Chieffi & Limongi (2004) imply y = 0.015 for Salpeter and y = 0.030 for Chabrier.", "Although disfavored by many observations, a Salpeter IMF in the mass range 0.1\u2212100M\u2299 is used as a reference throughout the rest of this review. Similarly, for consistency with prior work, we assume the canonical metallicity scale where solar metallicity is Z\u2299=0.02, rather than the revised value Z\u2299=0.014 of Asplund et al. (2009).", "Fundamentally, deriving the history of star formation in galaxies involves inferring mass from light. We observe the emission from galaxies at various wavelengths, and from those measurements, we try to infer either the rates at which the galaxies are forming stars or their integrated stellar masses. \nFigure 1\n illustrates the sensitivity of today's premier multiwavelength surveys to the SFRs and stellar masses of galaxies at high redshift. Rest-frame UV, IR, submillimeter and radio emission, as well as nebular lines such as H\u03b1 are all used to measure SFRs and are discussed in this section. In the absence of extinction, UV measurements are more sensitive than current IR or radio data by orders of magnitude, but in practice, dust attenuation is often severe. Long-wavelength data are essential to gain a comprehensive picture of cosmic star formation but are limited by current instrumental sensitivities, although ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) enables dramatic improvements at submillimeter wavelengths that are particularly valuable at higher redshifts. NIR to mid-infrared (MIR) measurements are critical for deriving stellar masses. Their sensitivity to stellar mass depends critically on the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population in a distant galaxy, hence on its age, SFH, and extinction. \nFigure 1b\n\n illustrates two limiting cases: a maximum-M/L model defined as a passively evolving stellar population as old as the Universe and a minimum-M/L model defined as a very young, unreddened, actively star-forming galaxy. In principle, surveys should be mass-complete to the maximum-M/L limits. Much less massive galaxies with young, low-M/L stellar populations can easily be detected, but observations would miss dusty or evolved galaxies with lower masses. The HST WFC3 camera has significantly improved NIR sensitivity compared with most ground-based imaging, but it samples only optical rest-frame light at z<3. Spitzer's IRAC remains the premier resource for deriving stellar masses at higher redshifts, and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide a major advance.\n", "", "\n Figure 1\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The conversions from light to mass are derived or calibrated using stellar population synthesis models, which encode our knowledge of stellar evolution and of the SEDs of stars, and compute the emergent spectrum for a galaxy with given properties. This knowledge is imperfect, although astronomers have made great progress developing population synthesis models and improving the libraries of empirical and theoretical stellar spectra that they use (for a recent review, see Conroy 2013).", "A galaxy (or the Universe as a whole) consists of stars that span a wide range of masses, ages, and metal abundances. The light from those stars may be attenuated by dust before it emerges from the galaxy; the dust dims and generally reddens the galaxy spectrum, and the heated dust re-emits energy in the IR. A galaxy spectrum arises from a composite stellar population whose true distribution of properties is generally unknown. For nearby galaxies, resolved color-magnitude diagrams can reveal the actual distributions of stellar properties, but for most galaxies, we can observe only their integrated light and properties of the emergent spectrum (particularly broadband colors) are often degenerate to different intrinsic properties. An often-noted example is the degeneracy between age, metallicity, and dust attenuation, all of which can redden the spectrum of a galaxy. Observations at higher spectral resolution, for example, of individual spectral lines, can help to resolve some degeneracies (e.g., to constrain stellar metallicities, population ages from absorption line strengths, or reddening from emission line ratios), but never all: The inherently composite nature of stellar populations requires that we make simplifying assumptions when interpreting the light, assumptions that generally cannot be uniquely tested for individual galaxies. Examples of such assumptions include the form of the IMF, the stellar metallicity distribution, the wavelength dependence of dust attenuation, or the precise SFH of the galaxy. The hope is that these assumptions can be made as reasonably as possible, that their impact on derived masses or SFRs can be estimated, and that ultimately they may be tested or constrained by observations in various ways.", "The IMF underlies the relation between mass, light, and stellar population age. It controls the ratio of hot, bright stars that dominate the light to cool, faint stars that usually dominate the mass. It regulates the luminosity and color evolution of the integrated stellar population, as stars with different masses evolve at different rates. It also affects the time evolution of the integrated stellar mass, which changes as more massive stars lose gas to the ISM via winds or detonate as SNe.", "It is essentially impossible to constrain the IMF from photometric measurements of the integrated light from galaxies: The color of a galaxy does not uniquely reveal its underlying IMF, as there are too many degeneracies to permit useful constraints. Even detailed spectroscopy does not usually offer strong constraints on the IMF overall, although certain spectral features can be useful diagnostics of the number of stars in a given mass range (e.g., Leitherer et al. 1999). The most direct constraints on the IMF come from counting stars as a function of mass in resolved, nearby stellar populations, but they must be very nearby (within our Galaxy and its satellites) to detect subsolar dwarf stars that dominate the mass of a stellar system. The next-best constraints come from integrated measurements of the mass-to-light ratio for star clusters or galaxies, using kinematics (velocity dispersions or rotation curves) to derive a mass for comparison to the luminosity. However, these measurements are difficult to make for faint galaxies at high redshift and require careful modeling to account for the role of dark matter and many other effects.", "For lack of better information, astronomers often assume that the IMF is universal, with the same shape at all times and in all galaxies. Although the IMF of various stellar populations within the Milky Way appears to be invariant (for a review, see Bastian et al. 2010), recent studies suggest that the low-mass IMF slope may be a function of the global galactic potential, becoming increasingly shallow (bottom light) with decreasing galaxy velocity dispersion (Conroy & van Dokkum 2012, Geha et al. 2013). It is still unknown, however, how galaxy to galaxy variations may affect the \u201ccosmic\u201d volume-averaged IMF as a function of redshift. In Section 5, we see how a universal IMF can provide a reasonably consistent picture of the global SFH. The exact shape of the IMF at low stellar masses is fairly unimportant for deriving relative stellar masses or SFRs for galaxies. Low-mass stars contribute most of the mass but almost none of the light and do not evolve over a Hubble time. Therefore, changing the low-mass IMF mainly rescales the mass-to-light ratio M/L and, hence, affects both stellar masses and SFRs derived from photometry to a similar degree. Changes to the intermediate- and high-mass region of the IMF, however, can have significant effects on the luminosity, color evolution, and the galaxy properties derived from photometry. It is quite common to adopt the simple power-law IMF of Salpeter (1955), truncated over a finite mass range (generally, 0.1 to 100M\u2299, as adopted in this review). However, most observations show that the actual IMF turns over from the Salpeter slope at masses <1M\u2299, resulting in smaller M/L ratios than those predicted by the Salpeter IMF. Some common versions of such an IMF are the broken power-law representation used by Kroupa (2001) and the log-normal turnover suggested by Chabrier (2003).", "Dust extinction is another important effect that must often be assumed or inferred, rather than directly measured. The shape of the extinction law depends on the properties of the dust grains causing the extinction. For observations of a single star, photons may be absorbed by dust or scattered out of the observed sightline. However, galaxies are 3D structures with mixed and varying distributions of stars and dust. Photons may be scattered both into and out of the sightline, and the optical depth of dust along the line of sight to the observer will be different for every star in the galaxy. These effects are generally lumped together into the simplifying assumption of a net dust attenuation curve, and such relations have been derived for local galaxy samples both empirically (e.g., Calzetti et al. 2000) and using theoretical modeling (Charlot & Fall 2000). However, all galaxies are not equal, and no net attenuation law is equally appropriate for all galaxies. There can always be stars that are completely obscured behind optically thick dust such that little or none of their light emerges directly from the galaxy, except reradiated as dust emission. Although this may not be a significant factor for many galaxies, there are certainly some starburst galaxies in which huge and bolometrically dominant star-formation activity takes place in regions screened by hundreds of magnitudes of dust extinction. UV/optical measurements will never detect this light, but the star formation can be detected and measured at other wavelengths, e.g., with FIR or radio data.", "To derive star formation rates or stellar masses for galaxies using stellar population synthesis models, astronomers typically assume relatively simple, parameterized SFHs. However, the SFHs of individual galaxies are unlikely to be smooth and simple; they may vary on both long and short timescales. The fact that young stars are more luminous than older stars leads to the problem of \u201coutshining\u201d (e.g., Papovich et al. 2001, Maraston et al. 2010)\u2014the light from older stars can be lost in the glare of more recent star formation and contributes relatively little to the observed photometry from a galaxy, even if those stars contribute significantly to its mass. SED model fits to galaxies with recent star formation tend to be driven largely by the younger, brighter starlight and may not constrain the mass (or other properties) of older stars that may be present.", "For the Universe as a whole, there is one \u201ccosmic\u201d IMF that represents the global average at a given time or redshift, regardless of whether the IMF varies from one galaxy to another. Similarly, there is a \u201ccosmic\u201d distribution of metallicities, a \u201ccosmic\u201d net attenuation of starlight by dust at a given wavelength, and the Universe as a whole obeys one \u201ccosmic\u201d SFH that, moreover, was probably relatively smooth over time\u2014i.e., any stochasticity or \u201cburstiness\u201d averages out when considered for the Universe as a whole. In principle, these facts can simplify the determination of the cosmic SFH, particularly when it is derived from measurements of integrated light averaging over all galaxies. In practice, however, astronomers often derive SFRs and stellar masses for individual galaxies in their deep surveys and then sum them to derive comoving volume averages. In that case, some of the advantages of the \u201ccosmic averaging\u201d are reduced.", "There are many ways in which to infer SFRs from observations of the integrated light from galaxies. Kennicutt (1998) and Kennicutt & Evans (2012) have presented extensive reviews of this topic, and here we recap only points that are especially relevant for measurements of the global SFH, particularly at high redshift. Virtually all observational tracers of star formation fundamentally measure the rate of massive star formation, because massive stars emit most of the energy from a young stellar population. However, different observational tracers are sensitive to different ranges of stellar masses; hence, they respond differently as a function of stellar population age. For example, H\u03b1 emission arises primarily from Hii regions photoionized by O stars with lifetimes shorter than 20 Myr, whereas the UV continuum is produced by stars with a broader mass range and with longer lifetimes. The time dependence of different indicators can complicate efforts to derive accurate SFRs for individual galaxies, especially if their SFRs may be rapidly changing (e.g., during a starburst event), but they should average out when summing over a whole population of galaxies.", "Newly formed stellar populations emit radiation over a broad spectrum. For a normal IMF, low-mass stars dominate the mass integrated over the whole stellar population, but at young ages, the luminosity is dominated by UV emission from massive stars. These stars have short lifetimes, so the UV emission fades quickly. For a Salpeter IMF, the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity from an evolving simple stellar population (SSP) (i.e., an ensemble of stars formed instantaneously and evolving together) with solar metallicity fades by a factor of 100 after 108 years and by factors of 103 to 106 after 109 years, depending on metallicity (\nFigure 2\n). Bolometrically, at least half of the luminous energy that an SSP produces over a 10-Gyr cosmic lifetime emerges in the first 100 Myr, mostly in the UV, making this a natural wavelength from which to infer SFRs.\n", "", "\n Figure 2\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "For a galaxy forming stars at a constant rate, the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity stabilizes once O stars start to evolve off the main sequence. For solar metallicity, by an age of 107.5 years, the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity has reached 75% of its asymptotic value, although convergence is somewhat slower at lower metallicity (\nFigure 2\n). For these reasons, the UV luminosity at wavelengths of \u223c1,500 \u00c5 (wavelengths from 1,400 \u00c5 to 1,700 \u00c5 have been used in the literature for both local and high-redshift studies) is regarded as a good tracer of the formation rate of massive stars, provided that the timescale for significant fluctuations in the SFR is longer than a few 107 years. For shorter bursts or dips in the SFR, changes in the UV continuum flux may lag those in the SFR and smooth over such variations.", "Although the 1,500-\u00c5 rest frame is readily accessible with ground-based optical observations of galaxies at redshifts z\u22731.4, measurements at lower redshifts require space-based UV data (e.g., from GALEX or HST) or are limited to longer UV wavelengths. Mid-UV reference wavelengths that have been used in the literature include 2,300 \u00c5 (the approximate central wavelength of the GALEX near-UV passband) and 2,800 \u00c5 (used, e.g., by Lilly et al. 1996). The mid-UV emission from a galaxy can have a larger contribution from longer-lived, lower-mass stars, particularly at later ages, and the time evolution of the luminosity is more gradual. This is particularly true after \u223c250 Myr, when the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity of an SSP drops off sharply, whereas the 2,800-\u00c5 luminosity continues to fade at an approximately exponential rate (\nFigure 2\n). For a constant SFR, the UV spectral slope reddens moderately with time, as the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity reaches a steady-state level earlier, whereas longer-lived (B and A) stars continue to build up and contribute to the 2,800-\u00c5 luminosity. This complicates the conversion from luminosity to SFR as well as any correction for dust extinction based on the UV spectral slope. Still, for young ages, both shorter and longer UV wavelengths usefully trace the SFR and have been used extensively in the literature. Moreover, longer UV wavelengths are subject to somewhat lesser dust attenuation. Wavelengths shorter than that of Ly\u03b1 (1,216 \u00c5) are rarely used to estimate SFRs, particularly at high redshift where absorption from neutral hydrogen in the IGM is strong.", "The UV luminosity output by a stellar population also depends on its metallicity, which affects stellar temperatures and line blanketing. Generally speaking, less-metal-rich stars produce more UV light. The amplitude of this effect is not insignificant and depends on the details of the SFH. From a Salpeter IMF and constant SFR, the range of FUV luminosity per unit SFR for stars spanning a factor of 100 in metallicity (from Z = 0.0003 to 0.03) is less than 0.24 dex, or 70%. These variations are larger at higher metallicities and older ages; therefore, we may expect significant evolution in the L\nFUV to the SFR conversion factor as the global metallicity of galaxies evolves.", "We express the conversion factor between the intrinsic FUV-specific luminosity L\n\u03bd(FUV) (before extinction or corrected for extinction) and the ongoing SFR as", "\n", "", "where L\n\u03bd(FUV) is expressed in units of erg s\u22121 Hz\u22121 and SFR in units of M\u2299 year\u22121. The precise value of the conversion factor \n\n is sensitive to the recent SFH and metal-enrichment history as well as to the choice of IMF. It is relatively insensitive to the exact FUV wavelength, as the UV spectrum of a galaxy with a constant SFR is quite flat in f\n\u03bd units, at least for ages much longer than 107 years. Generally in this review, we use FUV to refer to 1,500-\u00c5 emission or are explicit when we refer to other UV wavelengths. For a Salpeter IMF in the mass range 0.1\u2212100M\u2299 and constant SFR, the flexible stellar population synthesis (FSPS) models of Conroy et al.

Concentrating on the FUV behavior at 1,500 \u00c5 for constant \u03c8(z), the conversion factor is nearly constant, though slightly elevated at the highest redshifts as the cosmic age gets young, particularly for lower-metallicity models. A SFH that increases with time from z = 12 to 1.7, so that the UV-emitting population is on average younger over that redshift range, leads to a more gradually declining trend in \n\n with time. The dashed line incorporates one scenario for a global change in the metallicity of the star-forming population, evolving as Z\u2217=Z\n\u229910\u22120.15z\n (Kewley & Kobulnicky 2007). This particular evolution is only moderately well constrained at lower redshifts and should be taken as illustrative only, but we may certainly expect metallicities to be lower on average at higher redshift. The effects of metallicity dominate over those of age in this scenario, but the two counterbalance each other to a certain degree, so that \n\n changes by less than 20%. At 2,800 \u00c5, the redshift dependence of \n\n is stronger, particularly at z<2 as the global SFRD declines with time, although this may be partially canceled by the effects of metallicity evolution.

The widely used value from Kennicutt (1998) (and based on the calibration by Madau et al. 1998b), \n\n, is 20% larger than our calibration. Other recent analyses based on the GALAXEV libraries have also found lower mean conversion factors, for both low- and high-redshift galaxy populations (e.g., Salim et al. 2007, Haardt & Madau 2012). The FUV conversion tabulated in Kennicutt & Evans (2012) (from Murphy et al. 2011), if rescaled from the Kroupa to Salpeter IMF, is very close to the z = 0 solar metallicity value of \n\n in \nFigure 3\n, but our somewhat smaller value should be more representative for the peak era of cosmic star formation at high redshift.

This ratio is nearly constant, varying by only 5% with age and 3% over a factor of 100 in metallicity. Where necessary to convert SFRs from the literature from Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs to the Salpeter IMF, we divide by constant factors of 0.63 (Chabrier) or 0.67 (Kroupa). Similarly, \nFigure 4\n examines mass-to-light ratios for an SSP as a function of age in various bandpasses, comparing values for the Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs to the Salpeter IMF. Again, these ratios are fairly constant with age and have very little dependence on the bandpass. In other words, the color evolution for an SSP with Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs is very similar to that for the Salpeter IMF, showing a roughly constant offset in M/L. [The similar time dependence of M/L for the \u201cbottom-light\u201d Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs to that for the Salpeter IMF is something of a coincidence (or a conspiracy). The rate of luminosity evolution for an SSP depends on the logarithmic IMF slope at masses greater than 1M\u2299 and is faster for the flatter x = 1.3 (Kroupa or Chabrier) than for the Salpeter value x = 1.35. However, the evolution of the recycled mass fraction is also faster for the Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs because their low-mass turnovers give them smaller mass fractions of long-lived stars. These two effects roughly cancel for x = 1.3, resulting in a time dependence for M/L that is nearly the same as that for the Salpeter IMF. For an SSP with a \u201cbottom-light\u201d IMF with a Salpeter slope x = 1.35, the ratio of M/L compared with that for a Salpeter IMF would decrease by \u223c16% over \u223c5 Gyr, and a constant IMF rescaling factor for derived stellar masses would be inappropriate.] The dependence on metallicity (not shown) is very weak. To rescale stellar masses from Chabrier or Kroupa to Salpeter IMF, we divide by constant factors 0.61 and 0.66, respectively.\n", "", "\n Figure 4\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The greatest drawback for UV measurements of star formation is the obscuring effect of dust. Extinction is strong in the UV, so even modest amounts of dust can dramatically suppress the emerging UV flux. Dust re-emits the absorbed energy in the IR, which we discuss in the next section. A reliable measurement of SFRs from UV light must either correct for the effects of dust absorption or measure the absorbed energy directly through IR emission. We will return to the relation between UV dust attenuation and IR emission in Section 3.1.3 below.", "The energy that dust absorbs from the UV is reradiated at MIR and FIR wavelengths, making IR observations another important tool for measuring SFRs. The effect of dust extinction at FIR wavelengths is generally regarded as negligible, although in the MIR extinction can still be relevant for the most deeply buried star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN). The total IR luminosity (L\nIR, usually defined as being integrated over the wavelength range 8\u20131,000 \u03bcm) is a measurement of the energy that was absorbed by dust mainly at UV wavelengths. Because most UV emission comes from star formation, the IR luminosity is often interpreted as being directly proportional to the absorbed fraction of the energy from star formation. However, active nuclei can also produce strong UV emission, often in dusty environments, and may contribute to IR emission by heating dust in the torus and clouds surrounding the AGN. Older stellar populations can also heat dust that is present in the ISM of a galaxy, contributing to the FIR emission. This is important particularly for \u201cmature\u201d galaxies with low current SFRs in the nearby Universe: For a galaxy such as our Milky Way, perhaps half of the FIR emission comes from dust heated by older stars, not from young star-forming regions (Lonsdale Persson & Helou 1987). However, for very actively star-forming galaxies without AGN, it is generally assumed that most of the IR emission arises from new star formation. Ideally, a galaxy's total IR luminosity would be measured by fitting a dust emission model to observations at several wavelengths, hopefully spanning the peak of dust emission. In practice, however, such multiwavelength data are often unavailable, and astronomers frequently use an SED template that is often derived from observations of local galaxies to extrapolate from a single observed flux density at some MIR or FIR wavelength, not necessarily close to the dust emission peak, to a total L\nIR. Thus, variations in the dust emission properties from galaxy to galaxy can lead to significant uncertainties in not only this bolometric correction but also the estimation of SFRs.", "Arising from various components heated to different temperatures, the spectrum of dust emission is fairly complex. Most of the dust mass in a galaxy is usually in the form of relatively cold dust (15\u201360 K) that contributes strongly to the emission at FIR and submillimeter wavelengths (30\u20131,000 \u03bcm). Dust at several different temperatures may be present, including both colder grains in the ambient ISM and warmer grains in star-forming regions. Emission from still hotter, small-grain dust in star-forming regions, usually transiently heated by single photons and not in thermal equilibrium, can dominate the MIR continuum (\u03bb <30 \u03bcm) and may serve as a useful SFR indicator (e.g., Calzetti et al. 2007). The MIR spectral region (3\u201320 \u03bcm) is both spectrally and physically complex: It has strong emission bands from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and absorption bands primarily from silicates. The strength of emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can depend strongly on ISM metallicity and radiation field intensity (e.g., Engelbracht et al. 2005, 2008; Smith et al. 2007). Strong silicate absorption features are seen when the column density of dust and gas is particularly large toward obscured AGN and perhaps even nuclear starburst regions. AGN may contribute strong continuum emission from warm dust and can dominate over star formation at MIR wavelengths. By contrast, in the FIR, their role is less prominent.", "The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Spitzer Space Telescope were the first telescopes with MIR sensitivities sufficient to detect galaxies at cosmological redshifts. In particular, Spitzer observations at 24 \u03bcm with the MIPS instrument are very sensitive and capable of detecting \u201cnormal\u201d star-forming galaxies out to z\u22482 in modest integration times. Spitzer is also very efficient for mapping large sky areas. It has a 24-\u03bcm beam size that is small enough (5.7 arcsec) to reliably identify faint galaxy counterparts to the IR emission. However, only a fraction of the total IR luminosity emerges in the MIR. As noted above, it is a complicated spectral region that leads to large and potentially quite uncertain bolometric corrections from the observed MIR flux to the total IR luminosity. At z\u22482, where 24-\u03bcm observations sample rest-frame wavelengths around 8 \u03bcm, where the strongest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands are found, spectral templates based on local galaxies span more than an order of magnitude in the ratio L\nIR/L\n8\n\u03bc\nm (e.g., Chary & Elbaz 2001, Dale & Helou 2002, Dale et al. 2005). More information about the type of galaxy being observed is needed to choose with confidence an appropriate template to convert the observed MIR luminosity to L\nIR or an SFR.", "The FIR thermal emission is a simpler and more direct measurement of star-formation energy. Partly owing to their large beam sizes that resulted in significant confusion and blending of sources and in difficulty localizing galaxy counterparts, ISO and Spitzer offer only relatively limited FIR sensitivity for deep observations. The Herschel Space Observatory dramatically improved such observations: Its 3.5-m mirror diameter provided a point spread function FWHM (full width half maximum) small enough to minimize confusion and to identify source counterparts in observations from 70 to 250 \u03bcm. However, at the longest wavelengths of the Herschel SPIRE instrument, 350 and 500 \u03bcm, confusion becomes severe. Herschel observations can directly detect galaxies near the peak of their FIR dust emission: Dust SEDs typically peak at 60\u2013100 \u03bcm in the rest frame, within the range of Herschel observations out to z<4. Temperature variations in galaxies lead to variations in the bolometric corrections for observations at a single wavelength, but these differences are much smaller than for MIR data, generally less then factors of 2.", "Despite Herschel's FIR sensitivity, deep Spitzer 24-\u03bcm observations, in general, still detect more high-z sources down to lower limiting IR luminosities or SFRs. At z\u22482, the deepest Herschel observations only barely reach to roughly \n\n [the characteristic luminosity of the \u201cknee\u201d of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF)], leaving a large fraction of the total cosmic SFRD undetected, at least for individual sources, although stacking can be used to probe to fainter levels. Deep Spitzer 24-\u03bcm observations detect galaxies with SFRs several times lower, and many fields were surveyed to faint limiting fluxes at 24 \u03bcm during Spitzer's cryogenic lifetime. Therefore, there is still value in trying to understand and calibrate ways to measure star formation from deep MIR data, despite the large and potentially uncertain bolometric corrections.", "In practice, observations of IR-luminous galaxies detected at high redshift with both Spitzer and Herschel have demonstrated that the IR SEDs for many galaxies are well behaved and that variations can be understood at least in part. Several pre-Herschel studies (Daddi et al. 2007; Papovich et al. 2007; Magnelli et al. 2009, 2011) compared 24-\u03bcm observations of distant galaxies with those of other SFR tracers, including Spitzer FIR measurements (either individual detections or stacked averages) and radio emission. On average, the MIR to FIR flux ratios for galaxies at z\u22721.3 match those predicted by local IR SED templates such as those of Chary & Elbaz (2001), implying that 24-\u03bcm-derived SFRs should be reliable. However, at higher redshift, 1.31011\nL\n\u2299 and >1012\nL\n\u2299, respectively) are merger-driven starbursts, but at z\u22482 where the SFRs and sSFRs of galaxies are globally much larger, the majority of LIRGs and ULIRGs are \u201cnormal\u201d main-sequence galaxies. Their IR SEDs are more similar to those of ordinary, local star-forming spiral galaxies and have smaller bolometric corrections from observed 24-\u03bcm data (rest frame \u03bb \u22488 \u03bcm) than those predicted by SED templates designed to match local LIRGs and ULIRGs. Elbaz et al. (2011) constructed a \u201cuniversal\u201d main-sequence SED from the ensemble of high-z Spitzer and Herschel photometry for galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields at 0.3<z<2.5. This SED leads to consistent total IR luminosities for the large majority of galaxies over that redshift range. Although no single template can be used to accurately derive L\nIR or SFR from MIR observations for all galaxies, we now have a better understanding of how this can be done on average, which may be sufficient for deriving the global redshift evolution of the IR luminosity density or its corresponding SFRD. Rodighiero et al. (2011) (see also Sargent et al. 2012) showed that starbursts (whose IR SEDs deviate significantly from those of the main-sequence population) account for only 10% of the global SFRD at z\u22482. With the data now available from Herschel and Spitzer, a broad understanding of the evolving IRLF and IR luminosity density, at least at 0<z<2.5, seems within reach.", "MIR and FIR observations require space-based telescopes, but at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths, observations can once again be made from the ground within certain atmospheric transmission windows. The advent of submillimeter bolometer array cameras such as SCUBA on the JCMT revolutionized the field and led to the first detections of a large population of ULIRGs at high redshift (e.g., Smail et al. 1997, Hughes et al. 1998, Barger et al. 1998). Until recently, only the most luminous high-z objects could be readily detected, but the new ALMA interferometer will improve detection sensitivities by more than an order of magnitude, albeit over small fields of view. As noted above, submillimeter observations measure emission beyond the peak of dust emission, where flux is declining steeply with wavelength in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the SED. This leads to a negative K correction so strong that it cancels out the effects of distance: A galaxy with a given IR luminosity will have roughly constant submillimeter flux if it is observed at any redshift 1<z<10. By contrast, the bolometric corrections from the observed submillimeter wavelengths to the total IR luminosities are large and depend strongly on dust temperature. This can lead to significant uncertainties interpreting submillimeter fluxes from high-redshift sources and a bias toward detecting galaxies with the coldest dust emission.", "By analogy with Equation 10, we express the conversion from IR luminosity (L\nIR) to ongoing SFR as", "\n", "", "where L\nIR is the IR luminosity integrated over the wavelength range from 8 to 1,000 \u03bcm. Here, it is assumed that the IR emission is entirely due to recent star formation, but in practice, AGN and older stars can contribute to dust heating. Furthermore, if the net dust opacity to young star-forming regions in a galaxy is not large and if a significant amount of UV radiation emerges, then the SFR derived from the IR luminosity will represent only a fraction of the total. Hence, we write SFRIR in Equation 11 to indicate that this is only the dust-obscured component of the SFR. For this reason, some authors advocate summing the SFRs derived from the observed IR and UV luminosity densities, the latter uncorrected for extinction. Once again, we calibrate the conversion factor \n\n using the FSPS models of Conroy et al. (2009), which also incorporate dust attenuation and re-emission. We assume simple foreground-screen dust attenuation from Calzetti et al. (2000), although the details of the dust absorption model matter relatively little. The luminosity integrated from 8 to 1000 \u03bcm depends only mildly on the detailed dust emission parameters (essentially, the dust temperature distribution) for a broad range of reasonable values. Because the dust luminosity is primarily reprocessed UV emission from young star formation, the conversion factor \n\n also depends on the details of the SFH and on metallicity. In practice, we may expect that galaxies with substantial extinction and bolometrically dominant dust emission are unlikely to have low metallicities; here, we assume solar metallicity for our calibration. We modify Equation 11 to account for both the FUV and FIR components of star formation:", "\n", "", "where L\nFUV is the observed FUV luminosity at 1,500 \u00c5 with no correction for extinction. We use FSPS models with a Salpeter IMF, solar metallicity, and constant SFR to compute L\nFUV and L\nIR as a function of age for various levels of dust attenuation; we then solve for \n\n. \nFigure 5\n shows the result of this calculation: SFR is expressed in units of M\u2299 year\u22121, and both the FUV and IR luminosities are expressed in solar units (with L\nFUV=\u03bdL\n\u03bd) to display both on the same scale. As shown in Section 3.1.1, the FUV emission reaches a steady state after \u223c300 Myr, and for this calculation, we use the asymptotic value \n\n (equivalently, \n\n year\u22121 erg\u22121 s Hz). Instead, L\nIR increases slowly (hence, K\nIR decreases) as the optical rest-frame luminosity of longer-lived stars continues to build, some fraction of which is then absorbed by dust and re-emitted. This model with constant SFR and constant dust attenuation results in a modest effect of \u223c0.1 dex in \n\n per dex in log t. However, in practice, older stars will likely have lower dust extinction than younger stars, thus further reducing this trend. At ages of a few 108 years, K\nIR depends very little on the total extinction. Kennicutt (1998) proposed a calibration factor \n\n, which is fully consistent with the models shown in \nFigure 5\n for an age of 300 Myr. We adopt that value for this review. For luminosities measured in cgs units, we can write \n\n year\u22121 erg\u22121 s.\n", "", "\n Figure 5\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "As noted above, dust can substantially attenuate UV emission, not only compromising its utility for measuring SFRs, but also producing IR emission, which is a valuable tracer of star-formation activity. Considerable effort has been invested in understanding the physics and phenomenology of extinction in galaxies (for a review, see Calzetti 2001). In principle, the best way to account for the effect of dust attenuation is to directly measure the energy emitted at both UV and IR wavelengths, i.e., both the luminosity that escapes the galaxy directly and that which is absorbed and reradiated by dust. This provides a \u201cbolometric\u201d approach to measuring SFRs. In practice, however, data sensitive enough to measure FIR luminosities of high-redshift galaxies are often unavailable. Herschel greatly advanced these sorts of observations, but its sensitivity, although impressive, was sufficient to detect only galaxies with high SFRs >100M\u2299 year\u22121, at z>2.", "For star-forming galaxies with moderate extinction at z>1, optical photometry measuring rest-frame UV light is obtained much more easily than are suitably deep FIR, submillimeter, or radio data. Current observations of UV light are also typically much more sensitive to star formation than are those at other wavelengths (\nFigure 1\n). As a result, trying to infer SFRs from rest-frame UV observations alone is tempting, but this requires reliable estimates of dust extinction corrections. For example, Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are a UV-selected population of star-forming high-redshift galaxies. Their selection would favor relatively low extinction, but even LBGs are quite dusty: Reddy et al. (2012) used Herschel observations to determine that, on average, 80% of the FUV emission from typical (\n\n) LBGs at z\u22482 is absorbed by dust and reradiated in the FIR. Many more massive galaxies with high SFRs have greater extinction. So-called dust-obscured galaxies (Dey et al. 2008) have MIR to UV flux density ratios >1,000 (typically corresponding to L\nIR/L\nFUV>100) (Penner et al. 2012) and are quite common, contributing 5\u201310% of the SFRD at z\u22482 (Pope et al. 2008); many of these are nearly or entirely invisible in deep optical images.", "Nevertheless, the widespread availability of rest-frame UV data for high-redshift galaxies encourages their use for measuring the cosmic SFH. Presently, at z\u226b2, there is little alternative: Even the deepest Spitzer, Herschel, radio, or submillimeter surveys can detect only the rarest and most ultraluminous galaxies at such redshifts. By contrast, deep optical and NIR surveys have now identified samples of thousands of UV-selected star-forming galaxies out to z\u22487 and beyond.", "Attempts to measure and correct for dust extinction in high-z galaxies have generally used the UV spectral slope (designated \u03b2) as a measure of UV reddening and have adopted empirical correlations between UV reddening and UV extinction. Calzetti et al. (1994, 2000) used ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy to derive an empirical, average dust attenuation curve for a sample of local UV-bright star-forming galaxies. Meurer et al. (1999) (later updated by Overzier et al. 2011) used UV and FIR data for a similar local sample to empirically calibrate the relation between UV reddening (\u03b2) and UV extinction (IRX\u2261L\nIR/L\nFUV, which can be directly related to A\nFUV). The reasonably tight IRX-\u03b2 relation obeyed by the local UV-bright galaxies is broadly consistent with the Calzetti attenuation law, hence reinforcing its popularity. However, other local studies showed clearly that some galaxies deviate from these relations. Goldader et al. (2002) found that nearby ULIRGs deviate strongly from the Meurer IRX-\u03b2 relation; these ULIRGs have very large values of IRX but often with relatively blue UV spectral index \u03b2. This was interpreted to mean that the observed UV light from local ULIRGs is relatively unreddened star formation in the host galaxy that is unrelated to the bolometrically dominant star formation, which is entirely obscured from view at UV-optical wavelengths and detected only in the FIR. Instead, observations of ordinary spiral galaxies (Kong et al. 2004, Buat et al. 2005) measured redder values of \u03b2 for a given IRX. This is generally taken as evidence that light from older and less massive stars contributes significantly to the near-UV emission, leading to redder UV colors for reasons unrelated to extinction. In general, different relative distributions of stars and dust can lead to different net attenuation properties. Extinction can easily be patchy: Winds from star-forming regions can blow away dust on certain timescales, whereas other regions that are younger or more deeply embedded in the galaxy's ISM remain more heavily obscured. Dust heating also depends on geometry, leading to different distributions of dust temperatures and different emission spectra at IR and submillimeter wavelengths.", "At high redshift, there are only relatively limited tests of the relation between UV reddening and extinction. Reddy & Steidel (2004) and Reddy et al. (2006, 2010, 2012) have compared various SFR tracers (including radio, Spitzer 24-\u03bcm, and Herschel 100\u2013160-\u03bcm emission) to show that Calzetti/Meurer UV extinction laws are broadly appropriate for the majority of L\u2217 LBGs at z\u22482. However, they found evidence for systematic deviations for galaxies with the largest SFRs (>100M\u2299 year\u22121), which, similar to local ULIRGs, show \u201cgrayer\u201d effective attenuation (i.e., less UV reddening for their net UV extinction). They also found evidence for systematic deviations for the youngest galaxies, which show stronger reddening for their net FUV extinction, perhaps because of the metallicity or geometric effects that steepen the wavelength dependence of the UV reddening function compared with results from the Calzetti law. Assuming Calzetti attenuation, Daddi et al. (2007) and Magdis et al. (2010) also found broad consistency between UV-based and IR- or radio-based SFR measurements for samples at z \u2248 2\u20133 (although, see Carilli et al. 2008). However, studies that have selected galaxies primarily on the basis of their IR emission have tended to find significant deviations from Meurer/Calzetti attenuation. In general, these deviations indicate that UV-based SFRs using Meurer/Calzetti UV slope corrections significantly underestimate total SFRs (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005, Papovich et al. 2007). Such studies have also found that differently selected populations may obey systematically different net dust attenuation relations depending on the properties of the galaxies (Buat et al. 2012, Penner et al. 2012).", "Therefore, we must remain cautious about SFRs derived from UV data alone, even when estimates of UV reddening are available. Current evidence suggests that these may work well on average for UV-bright LBGs with relatively low reddening but may fail for other galaxies including the most IR-luminous objects that dominate the most rapidly star-forming galaxy population. Star formation that is obscured by too much dust, e.g., in compact starburst regions, will be unrecorded by UV observations and can be measured directly only with deep IR, submillimeter, or radio measurements.", "Star formation also produces nebular line emission from excited and ionized gas in Hii regions. Recombination lines of hydrogen such as H\u03b1 and Ly\u03b1 are often used to measure SFRs, because they have a close relation to photoionization rates that are mainly due to intense UV radiation from OB stars. Hence, they trace massive star formation quite directly, although the presence of AGN can also contribute to these lines. Other lines from heavier elements such as [Oii] 3,727 \u00c5 or [Oiii] 5,007 \u00c5 have been used, but they tend to have more complex dependence on ISM conditions such as metallicity or excitation. Emission lines are also subject to absorption by dust in the star-forming regions. This is particularly true for Ly\u03b1, which is a resonance line, scattered by encounters with neutral hydrogen atoms. Such encounters can greatly increase the path length of travel for Ly\u03b1 and hence increase the likelihood that it may encounter a dust grain and be absorbed. Overall, H\u03b1 is regarded as the most reliable among the easily accessible nebular SFR tracers (e.g., Moustakas et al. 2006). Weaker but less extinguished hydrogen lines in the NIR, such as Paschen \u03b1, can be very useful for measuring SFRs in dusty galaxies, but they are generally accessible only at very low redshift, although the JWST will open the possibility for measuring these for significant numbers of galaxies at cosmological distances.", "Radio emission is also correlated with star formation, as SN-accelerated electrons emit nonthermal radiation at centimeter wavelengths; thermal (free-free) emission from electrons in Hii regions can also contribute, particularly at higher frequencies (>5 GHz). The physics is somewhat complicated and not entirely understood, but a remarkably tight correlation is observed between radio emission and FIR emission in local galaxies spanning many orders of magnitude in luminosity (e.g., Condon 1992, Yun et al. 2001). Radio emission is free from dust extinction and thus offers a relatively unbiased tracer of star formation. However, it is difficult to obtain radio observations deep enough to detect ordinary star-forming galaxies at high redshift, although recent upgrades to the Karl G. Jansky VLA have significantly improved its sensitivity. AGN can also contribute to radio emission, occasionally dominating for radio-loud AGN (which are a minority population). Radio emission should also be suppressed at earlier cosmic epochs, as electrons should lose energy by inverse Compton scattering off microwave background photons whose energy density increases at high redshift. Recent studies have found little evidence for redshift evolution in the FIR to radio correlation (Appleton et al. 2004; Ivison et al. 2010a,b; Sargent et al. 2010a,b; Mao et al. 2011).", "Even X-rays have been used to trace SFRs. X-rays are typically regarded as a quintessential signature of AGN activity in galaxies, but they are also produced by young stellar populations, notably by X-ray binaries. In the absence of an AGN, X-ray emission may be measured from individual star-forming galaxies out to z\u22481 in the deepest Chandra fields, and stacking measurements have been used to reach fainter fluxes in studies of UV-selected galaxies, with detections at 1<z<4 and upper limits at higher redshifts (Reddy & Steidel 2004; Laird et al. 2005, 2006; Lehmer et al. 2005; Basu-Zych et al. 2013). However, the proportionality between X-ray luminosity and SFR may vary with stellar population age and other parameters that could affect the mix of low- and high-mass X-ray binaries present in a galaxy; various calibrations that differ significantly have been published (e.g., Ranalli et al. 2003, Persic et al. 2004). Overall, because most of the cosmic X-ray background arises from AGN (for a review, see Brandt & Hasinger 2005), the value of using X-rays to measure the cosmic SFH seems limited (we do not discuss this method further).", "Whereas hot young stars emit most of their energy at UV wavelengths, the cooler low-mass stars that dominate the stellar mass of a galaxy emit most of their light at red optical and NIR wavelengths. If we examine the SED of an evolving SSP from ages older than 109 years, the bulk of the luminosity (in \u03bbf\n\u03bb energy units) is emitted in a broad plateau between 0.4 and 2.5 \u03bcm, peaking at \u223c1 \u03bcm for ages >2 Gyr. (In f\n\u03bd flux density or AB magnitude units, the SED peak is at approximately 1.6 \u03bcm, where there is a minimum in the H\u2212 opacity of cool stellar atmospheres.) The effects of dust extinction are also greatly reduced at NIR wavelengths: For Calzetti attenuation, the extinction (in magnitudes) A in the K-band is 10 times smaller than that in the V-band and 25 times smaller than that at 1,600 \u00c5.", "The luminosity, and hence the mass-to-light ratio, of a stellar population evolves very steeply with time at UV and blue wavelengths: Young stars evolve quickly off the main sequence but more slowly at red and NIR wavelengths. Therefore, observations in the NIR rest frame more closely trace the integrated stellar mass of a galaxy, but we cannot neglect the effects of evolution: The flux at 1 \u03bcm still changes by more than an order of magnitude as a stellar population ages from 0.1 to 10 Gyr (see, e.g., figure 9 from Bruzual & Charlot 2003). Therefore, we need to do more than simply measure the NIR luminosity to infer a stellar mass.", "In effect, astronomers use the colors or SED of a galaxy to infer the expected mass-to-light ratio at some wavelength (preferably in the red or NIR) and then multiply the observed luminosity by M/L to estimate the stellar mass (M\u2217). The most common method is to fit spectral templates generated by stellar population synthesis models to broadband photometry in whatever bands are available that span rest-frame UV to NIR wavelengths, where stellar photospheric emission dominates the galaxy light. Generally speaking, researchers generate a large suite of models that span a wide range of stellar population parameters, including the past SFH, age, metallicity, and dust attenuation. The IMF is typically fixed, because there is almost no photometric signature that can usefully constrain it. The suite of models is redshifted to match a galaxy of interest. The models are then convolved by the filter bandpasses to generate synthetic broadband fluxes that are fit to the photometry, allowing the luminosity normalization to vary and minimizing \u03c7\n2 or some other likelihood parameter. The unnormalized models have a specified unit mass; therefore, normalization of the best-fitting model provides the best estimate of the galaxy's stellar mass, given the range of input parameters that were allowed.", "In principle, this method can be used to constrain other stellar population parameters such as the galaxy's age, SFR, or the degree of extinction that is present. In practice, the fitting results for various parameters are often quite degenerate. For example, age, extinction, and metallicity all affect the integrated colors of a galaxy. As a result, the derived values of these parameters tend to be highly covariant: A galaxy may be red because it is old, dusty, or very metal rich. With very good photometry, particularly spanning a large range of wavelength and with many bandpasses that can more accurately sample the detailed spectral shape (e.g., measuring relatively sharp age-sensitive features such as the Balmer or 4,000-\u00c5 breaks), these constraints can be improved, but it is hard to avoid significant degeneracies. Careful practitioners may consider joint probability distributions for models that fit with acceptable likelihood. The stellar mass tends to be the best-constrained parameter, largely because the degeneracies in other parameters all tend to affect the net M/L of the model in similar ways. Redder colors from age, dust, or metallicity all tend to affect M/L to a similar (but not identical) degree. Whereas parameters such as age or reddening may be individually uncertain, the net M/L of acceptable models does not vary so much. Thus, the total mass is well constrained. Many papers have discussed stellar population modeling uncertainties in estimating galaxy masses; these are thoroughly reviewed by Conroy (2013).", "Other than the choice of the IMF, the largest uncertainty that affects the derived stellar mass is usually the necessarily imperfect knowledge of the galaxy's past SFH. Fundamentally, more recently formed stars can easily outshine older stars and dominate the observed light, even at red wavelengths. The observed photometry may be dominated by the younger starlight, even though the actual galaxy mass may be dominated by older stars that are lost in the glare of the younger stars (\u201coutshining,\u201d e.g., Papovich et al. 2001, Maraston et al. 2010) and thus have little impact on the choice of the best-fitting models. Therefore, the model fitting often underestimates the age of the galaxy or the potential contribution of older stars to the mass, and it may also underestimate the mass. If the actual SFH were well known (which is almost never the case in practice), this might not be a problem. For example, the models used to fit the photometry are often assumed to have smoothly varying SFRs, but the actual SFHs of real galaxies can be complex and nonmonotonic, fluctuating with time and perhaps punctuated by short-duration bursts. Even if very large suites of models with complex SFHs are considered, outshining tends to ensure that recently formed stars drive the model fitting, whereas the mass in older stars is poorly constrained. This effect generally leads to underestimation of galaxy stellar masses (Pforr et al. 2012). Realistically constraining the distribution of allowable past SFHs for real galaxies, especially at high redshift, remains a basic limitation when deriving stellar masses.", "In practice, these SFH degeneracies are largest for galaxies with recent star formation. For galaxies that have not formed stars in a long while (say >1 Gyr) or for which the current SFR is small compared with the stellar mass (often quantified by the sSFR), the outshining is small and, thus, so is the resulting systematic uncertainty on M/L. Therefore, stellar masses for present-day elliptical galaxies, which are old with little or no ongoing star formation, or for ordinary spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way tend to be reasonably well-constrained, whereas those for very actively star-forming galaxies are less certain. As an example, Papovich et al. (2001) fit models to HST WFPC2 and NICMOS photometry for faint LBGs at z\u22482.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N). When using models with smoothly varying SFHs, they found stellar mass uncertainties to be \u03c3(logM\u2217)<0.5 dex, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex, i.e., less than a factor of 2. However, if they considered \u201cmaximal M/L\u201d models, which allowed for as much older stellar mass as possible within the \u03c7\n2 fitting constraints formed at z=\u221e, the masses could in principle be as much as 3 to 8 times larger. In practice, such extreme models seem unlikely. Moreover, the early work of Papovich et al. (2001) used photometry only out to the K-band or rest-frame wavelengths \u223c6,000 \u00c5 at z = 2.5. Today, deep Spitzer IRAC photometry routinely measures fluxes for high-z galaxies at redder rest-frame wavelengths and can significantly improve stellar mass constraints. Nevertheless, even with the best data from Spitzer (or the JWST in the future), the effects of outshining fundamentally limit our certainty about stellar mass estimates for individual objects. These effects can be reduced only if reasonable prior assumptions can more tightly constrain the range of allowable SFHs.", "Interestingly, at very high redshifts some of these SFH uncertainties are reduced, simply because the Universe is much younger. At z>6, the Universe is less than 1 Gyr old, and the oldest stars in the galaxies must be younger than that; this sets a cap on M/L for a hypothetical unseen old population and thus on its possible contribution to the total stellar mass. Curtis-Lake et al. (2013) provided a recent and detailed discussion of stellar population modeling uncertainties for galaxies at z \u223c 6.", "Additionally, the practitioners who create stellar population models have not reached complete consensus: Questions regarding evolutionary tracks, the contributions of certain stellar subpopulations, and the behavior of stellar populations at low and high metallicities remain topics of debate or are poorly calibrated by observations. One widely recognized example of such uncertainties was highlighted by Maraston (2005), whose models featured significantly greater contributions of emission from thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars to the red and NIR rest-frame light at SSP ages between a few hundred million years and \u223c2 Gyr. The enhanced red luminosity led to lower M/L at these wavelengths and redder colors, with potentially quite significant effects (factors of 2 or more) in derived stellar masses for galaxies dominated by stars in this age range. Although such populations may not dominate in most present-day galaxies, at z\u22482\u22124 when the Universe was only a few billion years old their role must be accurately modeled to ensure proper estimates of stellar masses. Maraston et al. (2006) found that this could reduce derived stellar masses by \u223c60% on average for K-band-selected star-forming galaxies at z\u22482 compared with results computed using the popular models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003). Although Bruzual et al. (2013) released new models in 2007 that featured enhanced TP-AGB emission, they have argued in recent conference presentations for weaker TP-AGB emission more similar to that in the older models. Given the lack of a completely satisfactory way to compute this contribution on theoretical principles, a lot hangs on the sparseness of data available to empirically calibrate the emission and evolution of TP-AGB stars.", "Over the past 18 years, a sea of published measurements of the cosmic SFRD or SMD at many different redshifts have used different data sets and methods. Much of the observational work has been carried out in deep survey fields that have accumulated outstanding multiwavelength data for this purpose and cover different angular scales to different depths (\nFigure 6\n). We do not attempt a comprehensive review of this literature. Instead, we highlight key data sets and analyses from roughly the first decade of cosmic SFR measurements (1996\u20132006) and then focus on the most important or extensive recent measurements that we use in our analysis in Section 5. Hopkins (2004) and Hopkins & Beacom (2006) provided an extensive compilation of SFRD measurements up to 2006, whereas Wilkins et al. (2008a) summarized SMD derivations through 2007. Other authors have also compiled these data more recently (e.g., Behroozi et al. 2013).\n", "", "\n Figure 6\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The number of papers that present measurements of the cosmic SFR history vastly exceeds the number of different data sets that have been used for this purpose because certain well-trodden surveys such as the HDF-N, the Hubble Ultradeep Field (HUDF), GOODS, and COSMOS have been used repeatedly by many groups or by the same groups who continue to refine their analyses or add new observational information. One should thus be cautious compiling results from many different studies: Although the analyses are independent, the data used and the actual galaxies measured may not be different. For example, the SFHs of GOODS-South and COSMOS are particularly well studied, but true cosmic variance due to clustering in those fields will not cancel out from one analysis to another.", "The largest number of analyses of the cosmic SFRD have used rest-frame UV continuum measurements, largely because the method is quite sensitive (see \nFigure 1\n) and can be applied over a very broad range of redshifts. Rest-frame FUV (1,500 \u00c5) SFRs at 1.4<z<6 can be measured using optical photometry that is (relatively) easily obtained with ground-based or HST imaging. The heavy use of photometric redshifts in recent years has led to much work based on imaging data alone, with little or no spectroscopy. However, in popular deep survey fields such as GOODS or COSMOS, the photo-z values are typically well calibrated thanks to the widespread availability of thousands of spectroscopic measurements. At z<1, rest-frame UV measurements ideally require space-based telescopes such as GALEX or HST to reach rest-frame wavelengths near 1,500 \u00c5, but several studies have used blue or U-band imaging to sample mid-UV wavelengths (e.g., 2,800 \u00c5) at z<1 instead.", "The modern era of SFRD measurements arguably began with the analysis of Lilly et al. (1996), who were the first to combine a large and deep (for its time) spectroscopic redshift survey with multiwavelength photometry and to derive LFs and luminosity densities at several different rest-frame wavelengths, including the rest-frame UV. The Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) was carried out using the 4-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and mainly surveyed the Universe out to z<1. The available BVIK-band photometry permitted direct measurement of 2,800-\u00c5 rest-frame luminosities at z>0.5 and down to z\u22480.3 with modest spectral extrapolation. Lilly et al. (1996) found that the 2,800-\u00c5 luminosity density declined by approximately one order of magnitude from z = 1 to the present, which they interpreted as a steep decline in the SFRD.", "\nMadau et al. (1996) used the then-new HDF observations to extend this analysis to much higher redshift. They employed color-selected LBG samples at \u2329z\u232a=2.75 and 4. The deep HST WFPC2 photometry allowed luminosities to be measured at 1,500 \u00c5 in the rest frame, reaching fainter than contemporaneous ground-based LBG data at z\u22483 from Steidel et al. (1996) and thus integrating further down the LF. Madau et al. (1996) quoted only lower limits for the SFRD, without extrapolation to fainter luminosities (relatively small, given the depth of the HDF imaging) and without correction for dust absorption (significant, but at the time little known). Later analyses (e.g., Sawicki et al. 1997, Madau et al. 1998b, Steidel et al. 1999) fit Schechter LFs to the photometric samples to extrapolate to total UV luminosity densities. Connolly et al. (1997) and Pascarelle et al. (1998) combined the optical HST imaging of the HDF with ground-based NIR data to improve photometric redshift analyses in the redshift \u201cdesert\u201d at 11 and the CFRS measurements at z<1 suggested a general \u201crise and fall\u201d picture of a UV luminosity density and, by inference, the cosmic SFH that peaked somewhere between z\u22481 and 2.", "Various surveys subsequently extended this finding using other data sets or different analyses. Several groups reanalyzed the HDF (and later the HDF-South) data in various ways or made use of deeper spectroscopic surveys with the Keck telescope. Cowie et al. (1999) and Wilson et al. (2002) combined Keck spectroscopy in several fields with deep U-band imaging to measure shorter rest-frame UV wavelengths (2,000\u20132,500 \u00c5) at z<1 than were probed in the CFRS analysis of Lilly et al. (1996) and derived a shallower rate of decline in the SFRD. Wolf et al. (2005) used 17-filter intermediate and broadband imaging to obtain high-quality photometric redshifts at z<1.25 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and analyzed the 2,800-\u00c5 luminosity density evolution.", "Ideally, UV rest-frame observations at z<1 should be done from space telescopes to sample shorter UV wavelengths than those used in the ground-based studies by Lilly, Wilson, Wolf, and others. In early work, Treyer et al. (1998) and Sullivan et al. (2000) used the FOCA balloon-borne UV telescope to measure 2,000-\u00c5 luminosity densities at z\u22480.15. GALEX has since provided vastly more FUV data, including both wide-area and deeper surveys. Wyder et al. (2005) combined GALEX all-sky imaging survey data with distances from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) over 56 deg2 to measure local (z\u22480.055) LFs at 1,500 \u00c5 and 2,300 \u00c5. Budav\u00e1ri et al. (2005) analyzed a similar total sky area using somewhat deeper GALEX data and SDSS-derived photometric redshifts to compute LFs and densities at z<0.25. Salim et al. (2007) and Robotham & Driver (2011) have since analyzed much larger GALEX data sets with SDSS data to cover as much as 830 deg2. Robotham & Driver (2011) presented a straightforward derivation of the UV luminosity function (UVLF) and luminosity density, whereas Salim et al. (2007) used GALEX photometry as one ingredient to derive SFRs and the total SFRD.", "\nArnouts et al. (2005) combined much deeper GALEX observations with spectroscopy from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) and derived 1,500-\u00c5 rest-frame LFs at 0.2 < z < 1.2. Schiminovich et al. (2005) integrated these LFs to determine the 1,500-\u00c5 luminosity density, measuring evolution consistent with \u03c1FUV\u221d(1+z)2.5. This remains the most direct and frequently cited GALEX study of FUV luminosity densities at z<1, which is somewhat surprising, as there are many more deep GALEX observations in fields with extensive spectroscopy (COSMOS, AEGIS, GOODS, etc.). Yet, to our knowledge, there have been no other published LFs. The Arnouts/Schiminovich analysis is admirable, but it used only \u223c1,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts over the whole range \u0394z=1 in a single field covering 0.5 deg2. Hence, it may be subject to cosmic variance issues. This area is ripe for further exploitation of existing archival data.", "HST is the only other modern space telescope with UV capabilities, particularly with the UVIS channel of the WFC3 camera. Until recently, only one 50-arcmin2 field in GOODS-South had been surveyed to interesting depths to study distant galaxies (Hathi et al. 2010, Oesch et al. 2010). At z<1.4, where these data measure FUV rest-frame emission, the survey volume and counting statistics are poor. These data have also been used for Lyman break color selection at z\u22481.5\u20132. The analyses generally support relatively steep UVLFs with \u03b1<\u22121.5 with large uncertainties. Expanded WFC3 UVIS observations in the HUDF and GOODS-North field have been recently completed and should improve the existing measurements. A recent WFC3 UVIS survey of gravitationally lensed galaxies behind the massive cluster Abell 1689 (Alavi et al. 2013) has been used for Lyman break color selection to unprecedentedly faint FUV luminosities at z\u22482 to MAB\n\u2248\u221213, or \u223c1,000 times fainter than L\u2217 at that redshift. Alavi et al. (2013) found no turnover to the LF down to those limits and measured a faint-end slope \u03b1=\u22121.56\u00b10.13.", "\nCucciati et al. (2012) analyzed a larger, deeper and more complete spectroscopic sample in the same VVDS survey field studied by Arnouts et al. (2005) and Schiminovich et al. (2005). They fit SED models to multiband photometry from the U- to the K-bands to extrapolate flux density measurements to FUV rest-frame wavelengths at z<1.4. They demonstrated consistency with the GALEX luminosity densities from Schiminovich et al. (2005) but did not make direct use of the GALEX data. Although the largest and deepest spectroscopic sample used to derive UVLFs at 0 < z < 2, it is based on only one sightline and requires SED extrapolation to rest frame 1,500 \u00c5 at lower redshifts. Tresse et al. (2007) presented a similar, earlier analysis using shallower spectroscopy in two VVDS fields.", "Over many years, Steidel and collaborators have carried out an extensive campaign of Keck spectroscopy for Lyman break\u2013selected galaxies, especially at z\u22482 and 3 (Steidel et al. 2003, 2004). Their survey covers many widely spread sightlines and provides excellent control over cosmic variance. Among several LF analyses from these data, the most recent and definitive are those of Reddy et al. (2008) and Reddy & Steidel (2009). These still rely on deep photometric color-selected samples to probe the faint end of the LF, but with a degree of spectroscopic confirmation and calibration for brighter galaxies that is unmatched by any other survey. The use of UV rest-frame selection means that any LBG-based study will miss heavily dust-obscured star formation at these redshifts, but as a measure of the evolving UV luminosity density, the LBG surveys have provided the most robust method to date.", "At higher redshifts, 4 < z < 7, deep HST observations (discussed below) have dominated surveys for LBGs in recent years, but several ground-based imaging programs have made significant contributions, particularly surveying wider areas at (relatively) shallower depths to constrain the bright end of the LF. The Subaru telescope and its SuPrime Cam imager have been particularly important in this respect, although deep IR imaging from UKIRT and the VLT has also been used. Notable examples (not an exhaustive list) include Ouchi et al. (2004), Yoshida et al. (2006), Iwata et al. (2007), and McLure et al. (2009) at z = 4 to 6 and Ouchi et al. (2009), Castellano et al. (2010a,b), Bowler et al. (2012), and Tilvi et al. (2013) at z\u22487.", "The installation of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) enabled substantially more efficient optical HST imaging that covers fields much wider than the original HDF. ACS also offered significant gains in sensitivity at the reddest wavelengths, making Lyman break selection practical out to z\u22486. Two major ACS surveys led to new derivations of the cosmic SFRD. GOODS (Giavalisco et al. 2004b) observed two independent fields with combined area >60 times larger than the HDF through four filters. This provided a sample of several thousand Lyman break candidates at z\u22484 and of order 1,000 at z\u22485, reaching significantly fainter than L\u2217 and permitting robust characterization of the luminosity density. LBG selection at z\u22486 was less secure from GOODS ACS data alone, as it was based on a single color (i\u2212z) and could sample only relatively bright galaxies. The HUDF (Beckwith et al. 2006) observed a single ACS pointing (\u223c11 arcmin2) located within the GOODS-South region with very long exposure times and reaching fainter than the original HDF and with better sensitivity at higher redshifts. Both GOODS and the HUDF have been repeatedly revisited with new observations from HST over the years to add deeper optical imaging as well as NIR data, first from NICMOS (Thompson et al. 2006, Conselice et al. 2011) and later with WFC3 in the HUDF09 and HUDF12 programs (Bouwens et al. 2011b, Ellis et al. 2013) and the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) of several premier deep survey fields including GOODS (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011). These IR observations make Lyman break selection at z\u22486 far more robust and extend the method out to z\u22488, with a handful of unconfirmed candidates identified out to z\u224812.", "Early analyses of the GOODS data (Giavalisco et al. 2004a) found evidence for relatively mild evolution of the UV luminosity density from 2 < z < 5 and clear evidence that there were fewer high-luminosity galaxies at z\u22486 (Stanway et al. 2003, Dickinson et al. 2004). Subsequent studies have repeatedly mined the combined GOODS+HUDF observations, using deeper data and more rigorous analyses. At least 20 papers about high-redshift LFs using WFC3 data in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS have been published since 2010, augmenting at least a dozen others pre-WFC3. We cannot attempt to review them all here, but they have convincingly demonstrated that the UVLF evolves significantly at z>4. The current consensus is that this is primarily luminosity evolution, at least at 4 < z < 7, with L\u2217 brightening over time (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2007, 2012b; Grazian et al. 2011). As a result, the number density of bright LBGs increases rapidly with time, more quickly than does the integrated luminosity density. Analyses using the CANDELS and HUDF09+12 NIR imaging point to continued evolution out to z = 8 and perhaps beyond (Oesch et al. 2012, Yan et al. 2012, Lorenzoni et al. 2013, Schenker et al. 2013), although it would be prudent to recall that only a handful of galaxies at z\u22487 have reasonably secure spectroscopic confirmation and none at z>7.5. There is broad agreement that UV spectral slopes for LBGs are bluer at z>4 than at lower redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013), which has implications for their dust extinction and total SFRD. Most of these studies have examined the faint-end slope of the LF, measuring very steep values, in some cases approaching or exceeding the divergent value \u03b1=\u22122 (Bouwens et al. 2012b, McLure et al. 2013). Several studies have also extended SFRD analyses to 9 < z < 12, using data from the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011a, Ellis et al. 2013) or from lensing cluster studies (Coe et al. 2013). Although still in flux as better data accumulate, these measurements have considerable significance for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and for the reionization of the IGM (e.g., Robertson et al. 2013), but relatively little impact on the global star-formation budget of the Universe. According to current estimates, only \u223c1% of the cosmic SMD present today was formed at z>6.", "IRAS enabled the first measurements of the local far-infrared luminosity function (FIRLF) (Lawrence et al. 1986, Soifer et al. 1987, Saunders et al. 1990, Sanders et al. 2003). These were typically measured either at 60-\u03bcm observed wavelength or using FIR luminosities integrated over a broader wavelength range. They were also generally extrapolated from the measured IRAS fluxes using fitting formulas. Although various representations of FIR luminosity have been adopted, here we consider L\nIR as the luminosity integrated over the range 8\u20131,000 \u03bcm, which encompasses most of the bolometric luminosity of dust emission from nearly all sources of interest. The longest wavelength IRAS band was at 100 \u03bcm, but AKARI extended all-sky FIR measurements out to 160 \u03bcm to provide more reliable measurements of the bolometric luminosity and reduced bias against galaxies with cold dust temperatures. Goto et al. (2011a,b) reanalyzed the local IRLF incorporating AKARI data. Despite differences in detail, the results are largely consistent with previous IRAS measurements in the luminosity range of overlap. LFs have also been measured for IRAS samples selected at 12 and 25 \u03bcm (Rush et al. 1993, Shupe et al. 1998). LFs at longer IR wavelengths were measured for (rather small) local samples with ISO [90 \u03bcm (Serjeant et al. 2004); 170 \u03bcm (Takeuchi et al. 2006)], Herschel (250\u2013500 \u03bcm) (Dey et al. 2010, Vaccari et al. 2010), and with ground-based (sub)millimeter observations generally for IRAS-selected samples [1.2 mm (Franceschini et al. 1998); 850 \u03bcm (Dunne et al. 2000)]. New, large-area measurements using the largest Herschel surveys (e.g., H-ATLAS, covering 550 deg2 with observations from 100 to 500 \u03bcm) have not yet appeared in the literature.", "Nearly all studies found that the bright end of the IRLF cuts off less sharply than does the exponential used in the Schechter function. This has typically been modeled either as a double power law (e.g., Lawrence et al. 1986, Sanders et al. 2003) or as a combined log-normal and power law (e.g., Saunders et al. 1990). Locally, the bright end of the IRLF is dominated by galaxies with warmer dust temperatures, which tend to be starburst galaxies and dusty AGN (Saunders et al. 1990). Several studies have measured a steep faint-end slope \u03b1 (dN/dL\u221dL\n\u03b1), e.g., \u03b1=\u22121.6 (Sanders et al. 2003), \u03b1=\u22121.8 (Goto et al. 2011a), and \u03b1=\u22121.99 (Goto et al. 2011b). However, other studies have found flatter distributions, e.g., \u03b1=\u22121.2 to \u22121.0 (Saunders et al. 1990, Takeuchi et al. 2003, Vaccari et al. 2010). In practice, the faint end has not been well sampled locally except in a few of the IRAS surveys. Future analysis of the widest Herschel surveys may help resolve this.", "In local, relatively quiescent spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, more than half of the FIR luminosity is believed to arise, not from dust in active star-forming regions, but from dust in the general ISM that is heated by ambient starlight from intermediate- and older-age stellar populations (Lonsdale Persson & Helou 1987, Sodriski et al. 1997). The luminosity of the Milky Way is typical (L\nIR\u22481010L\u2299) (Sodriski et al. 1997) compared with the knee of the local IRLF at \n\n (Sanders et al. 2003). This implies that a significant fraction of the local IR luminosity density is not the direct result of young star formation. Thus, it may not be a good measure of the global SFR today. At higher redshift when the specific SFR of typical galaxies was much larger and the net dust extinction to star-forming regions was, on average, larger (see Section 5.1), we may expect the IRLF and its integral to more reliably trace the total SFRD. However, Salim et al. (2009) suggested that, even at higher redshift (z\u22480.7), intermediate-age stars may significantly contribute to MIR dust emission observed by Spitzer at 24 \u03bcm.", "The deepest surveys with ISO at 15 \u03bcm detected a few hundred galaxies, mainly at z\u2a7d1, in the HDF and a few other deep survey regions where spectroscopic and photometric redshifts were available (Rowan-Robinson et al. 1997, Aussel et al. 1999, Flores et al. 1999). Analyses of these generally agreed that the emission from dusty star formation increased steeply with redshift, although statistics were generally too poor to construct redshift-dependent LFs. Chary & Elbaz (2001) used measurements from ISO and SCUBA as well as constraints from the FIR background as measured by the COBE satellite to constrain a model for the evolution of the cosmic SFH. Their model exhibited a sharp decline in the SFRD by a factor of 10 or more from z\u22480.8 to the present, with a plateau of nearly constant star formation at 0.8 < z < 2. At higher redshifts, the SFRD was more poorly constrained. Submillimeter sources placed a rough lower bound, whereas the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) set an upper limit. Acceptable solutions ranged from flat evolution to an increase by a factor of \u223c10 from z = 4.5 to 2.", "\nSpitzer greatly enhanced the sensitivity and mapping efficiency for deep IR observations, particularly at 24 \u03bcm where the beam size (FWHM \u2248 5.7 arcsec) was small enough to enable relatively straightforward association with optical counterparts. Spitzer also observed in an era when very large spectroscopic redshift surveys were available or under way and when photometric redshift techniques were well established. Le Floc'h et al. (2005) produced an early, seminal analysis of 24-\u03bcm sources at 0.3 < z < 1.2 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. Integrating over derived IRLFs, they inferred an evolution of the IR luminosity density proportional to (1+z)3.9\u00b10.4, significantly steeper than the evolving UV luminosity density, \u03c1FUV\u221d(1+z)2.5 (Schiminovich et al. 2005). With strong luminosity evolution, the fraction of the IR luminosity density produced by LIGs and ULIGs evolved even more steeply: Le Floc'h et al. (2005) found that galaxies with L\nIR>1011L\u2299 produced 70% \u00b1 15% of the IR luminosity density at z\u22481, compared with \u223c5\u201315% today, depending on the adopted local LF. Several analyses of LFs, mainly at z<1, using shallower Spitzer data covering significantly wider areas have also been published: These include Babbedge et al. (2006) and Rujopakarn et al. (2010) at 24 \u03bcm and Patel et al. (2013) at 70 \u03bcm and 160 \u03bcm. The work by Rujopakarn et al. (2010) is particularly notable for its combination of (relatively) wide area (9 deg2), extensive spectroscopic redshifts (4,047 galaxies with z\u2a7d0.65), and 24-\u03bcm sensitivity (0.27 mJy, sufficient to reach \u223cL\u2217 out to z = 0.65), making it arguably the best bridge study to date between local (IRAS and AKARI) measurements and deep-field studies at z\u2a7e1.", "Several studies extended Spitzer 24-\u03bcm-based LF measurements to higher redshifts, z\u22482 to 2.5 (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005, Caputi et al. 2007, Rodighiero et al. 2010). Such studies primarily use deeper 24-\u03bcm data and fainter spectroscopic and photometric redshifts available in the two GOODS fields. [P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) used shallower 24-\u03bcm data, whereas Caputi et al. (2007) and Rodighiero et al. (2010) employed deeper data from the GOODS team. Rodighiero et al. (2010) also incorporated relatively shallow Spitzer 24-\u03bcm data covering 0.85 deg2 in one of the VVDS redshift survey fields.] Depending on the analysis, these studies all found flatter IR luminosity density evolution at higher redshifts with modestly lower or higher \u03c1(L\nIR) at z = 2 than at z = 1. All three studies also found that the characteristic IR luminosity \n\n brightened further at z>1, such that ULIRGs emitted either close to 50% of the total energy density at z\u22482 (Caputi et al. 2007, Rodighiero et al. 2010) or the majority of it (P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005).", "Depending on the data, methodology, and assumptions that are used, IRLFs estimated at high redshift have differed at both the faint and bright ends. At the faint end, the available data rarely constrain the slope of the LF at high redshift. Indeed, as noted above, there are significant differences in the faint-end slopes that have been measured at z\u22480. Data with a limiting 24-\u03bcm flux density of 80 \u03bcJy (as found for most of the earlier Spitzer studies described above) reach only a factor of a few fainter than typical estimates of \n\n at z\u22481, and they barely reach \n\n at z\u22482. Thus, most analyses are forced to assume a faint-end slope based on measurements at lower redshifts, making them subject to large (typically >100%) and uncertain extrapolations to total IR luminosity densities.", "Moreover, depending on the SED templates that are adopted, there are significant differences in the (large) extrapolations from observed MIR rest-frame measurements (e.g., 8-\u03bcm rest frame at z = 2) to the bolometric IR luminosity and SFR. Indeed, we expect such variations among real galaxies. Compared with several other studies, P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) found many more galaxies with L\nIR>1012L\u2299 at z\u22482, in part owing to different assumptions about these bolometric corrections. Also, different procedures to account for AGN emission (which can be particularly strong in the MIR) as well as heavy reliance on photometric redshifts may contribute to systematic issues in the IRLF, particularly at the bright end.", "As we noted above (Section 3.1.2), several studies (Papovich et al. 2007, Daddi et al. 2007) stacked data at longer FIR wavelengths (e.g., 70 \u03bcm) or in radio and submillimeter data and found that standard SED templates such as those of Chary & Elbaz (2001) tend to overestimate typical bolometric corrections from observed 24-\u03bcm data for galaxies at z\u22482. This suggested that true FIR measurements were needed to reliably determine luminosities and SFRs at high redshift. Huynh et al. (2007) made early measurements of the IRLF at z<1 using the deepest available Spitzer 70-\u03bcm data in GOODS-North. The sample of detected sources was very small, but it was generally consistent with the earlier 24-\u03bcm work by Le Floc'h et al. (2005).", "\nMagnelli et al. (2009, 2011) used comparably deep 70-\u03bcm data over a much wider area from the Far-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey to extend this work. In addition to counting detected sources (mostly at z<1.3, given the depth of the 70-\u03bcm data), Magnelli et al. (2009, 2011) stacked 70-\u03bcm data in bins of 24-\u03bcm flux and redshift to measure empirically the average conversion between observed MIR and FIR luminosities. Compared with previous studies, they also used significantly deeper 24-\u03bcm catalogs extending down to 30 \u03bcJy in the GOODS fields. At z<1.3, Magnelli et al. (2009) found that the average FIR over MIR flux ratios closely matched predictions from the template library of Chary & Elbaz (2001). They also measured LFs that were similar to previous measurements, but that extended to fainter luminosities significantly below the bend in the IRLF at z\u22481 and with better statistics. At z>1.3, however, Magnelli et al. (2011) confirmed previous suggestions that the average 70-\u03bcm to 24-\u03bcm flux ratios deviated systematically from the predictions of standard local SED templates. They extrapolated from the averaged 70-\u03bcm fluxes to the bolometric IRLF and found only a mild increase in L\u2217 and the luminosity contribution of ULIRGs from z\u22481 to 2. At lower redshifts, the faint-end slope was consistent with \u03b1=\u22121.6 as measured for local IRAS galaxies by Sanders et al. (2003). By z = 2, the data reach only slightly fainter than the IRLF knee, and the slope is not constrained. However, extrapolating with a fixed slope \u03b1=\u22121.6, Magnelli et al. (2011) found that the faint IRLF at z = 2 would be quite similar to that predicted by Reddy et al. (2008) on the basis of UV-selected galaxies and the dust absorption predicted from their UV spectral slopes.", "The Herschel Space Observatory significantly improved sensitivity and reduced the beam size for FIR (70\u2013500 \u03bcm) observations, and several large programs were dedicated to surveys of the most important multiwavelength-deep fields. Even the deepest Herschel surveys do not detect as many sources per square arcminute as are found in the deepest Spitzer 24-\u03bcm observations, but direct access to FIR wavelengths is invaluable for reliably estimating bolometric luminosities and SFRs at high redshift. Several analyses presented preliminary LFs out to z = 2 to 3 using data sets obtained early in the Herschel mission (Eales et al. 2010, Gruppioni et al. 2010, Lapi et al. 2011).", "More extensive analyses of larger Herschel data sets have recently appeared in the literature. Gruppioni et al. (2013) used sources selected in Herschel PACS observations at 70, 100, and 160 \u03bcm in the two GOODS fields as well as shallower but wider observations of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and COSMOS. They fit customized IR SED templates to photometry from both the PACS and SPIRE (250\u2013500 \u03bcm) instruments and computed IR luminosities based on spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. They derived LFs out to z<4.2. However, at the highest redshifts (3 < z < 4.2), the data are sensitive only to the rarest hyperluminous sources. Limiting their analysis to z<2.3, Magnelli et al. (2013) restricted their study to the deepest 70\u2013160-\u03bcm data available in the GOODS fields and extracted FIR fluxes to still-fainter limits at positions of 24-\u03bcm-detected sources. Note that, as is often the case, the fields analyzed and the data used in these studies overlap considerably; even if the methods of analysis are different, they cannot be considered to be fully independent. That said, in their range of overlap, the two analyses are generally consistent: They find somewhat stronger luminosity evolution at z>1 than in the Spitzer analysis of Magnelli et al. (2011) and, hence, demonstrate a larger contribution of ULIRGs to the total IR luminosity density at z\u22482 [but not as large as in some earlier Spitzer studies, e.g., by P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005)]. Magnelli et al. (2011) concluded that this difference (compared with their own very similar Spitzer analysis) is mainly due to better determination of the total IR luminosities of galaxies using the improved Herschel FIR measurements. Gruppioni et al. (2013) found that the characteristic luminosity \n\n continued to brighten at z>2, albeit at a slower rate. Neither survey reliably measured the faint-end slope of the IRLF at high redshift, and both fixed it to values derived locally. Each study adopted distinct values: Magnelli et al. (2011) used \u03b1=\u22121.6, whereas Gruppioni et al. (2013) used \u03b1 = \u22121.2. Given these different slopes, it is striking and perhaps surprising that these two analyses derive similar values for the total IR luminosity density at redshifts 0<z<2. Broadly speaking, both studies find evolution by a factor of \u223c6 between z = 1.1 and today and comparatively flat evolution at higher redshift to \u2329z\u232a=2.05 (Magnelli et al. 2011) and \u2329z\u232a=2.75 (Gruppioni et al. 2013), albeit with an increasing range of values allowed within the measurement uncertainties.", "\n\nFigure 7\n shows recent determinations of the IRLFs and UVLFs at 0<z<4. The UVLFs in the figure show the observed luminosities uncorrected for extinction and are presented in units of solar luminosities for more direct comparison with the IRLFs. This figure illustrates several points that indicate low extinction for galaxies with lower SFRs and a significant contribution from low-luminosity galaxies to the global SFRD at high redshift.\n\n\n", "", "\n Figure 7\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Before Spitzer and Herschel, ground-based submillimeter bolometer arrays, especially SCUBA at JCMT, provided an essential glimpse at dusty star formation at very high redshifts. As is frequently noted, the negative K correction at submillimeter wavelengths approximately cancels luminosity distance dimming at z>1. The flux limits of most submillimeter surveys constrain individual source detections to ultra- and hyperluminous galaxies, so that only the tip of the IRLF is sampled. In practice, the greatest limitation for deriving LFs or SFRD is identifying galaxy counterparts to submillimeter sources and measuring their redshifts. This limitation is due mainly to the large beam size of single-dish submillimeter observations, but it is also due to the fact that the optical counterparts are often very faint and sometimes invisible. Another consequence of the negative K correction is that substantial redshift uncertainties translate to only relatively small uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity. Hence, using radio-identified counterparts and very rough radio-millimetric redshift estimates, Barger et al. (2000) were able to make plausible estimates of the SFRD from submillimeter sources in broad redshift bins. Barger et al. (2012) recently updated their findings using a complete submillimeter galaxy (SMG) sample with accurate interferometric positions from the submillimeter array (SMA) and with more extensive redshift information, made possible in part thanks to recent advances in millimetric CO spectroscopy. Chapman et al. (2005) measured optical spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of radio-identified SMGs and derived the first SMG LFs at \u2329z\u232a=0.9 and \u2329z\u232a=2.5. These estimates were recently updated by Wardlow et al. (2011) using (mainly) photometric redshifts for another well-defined SMG sample. These analyses demonstrated a significant contribution of dusty SMGs to the cosmic SFRD at high redshift, mainly limited to z\u22724. However, recent discoveries of substantial numbers of SMGs out to z = 6.3 (e.g., Riechers et al. 2013) suggest that the dusty ultraluminous population may be important even in the first few billion years of the cosmic SFH.", "Although direct FIR detection of individual sources at z\u226b2 is limited to the most extremely luminous objects (\nFigure 1\n), the CIRB provides additional constraints on dusty star formation at the highest redshifts (Pei et al. 1999, Gispert et al. 2000). FIR source counts and the CIRB were reviewed by Lagache et al. (2005) and recent results from Herschel are reviewed by Lutz (2014) in this volume, so we only briefly discuss this topic here. Sources directly detected by Herschel in the deepest observations resolve \u223c75% of the CIRB at 100 and 160 \u03bcm (Berta et al. 2011, Magnelli et al. 2013), albeit with significant uncertainties at 100 \u03bcm. Stacking Herschel data at the position of sources detected by Spitzer at 24 \u03bcm detects an even larger fraction that, with modest extrapolation, can account for the entire CIRB at these wavelengths. At 250 to 500 \u03bcm, where confusion is more severe in Herschel SPIRE data, the directly resolved fractions are smaller (from 15% to 5% at 250 to 500 \u03bcm), whereas stacking detects 73% to 55%. Again, an extrapolation is consistent with resolving the entire background (B\u00e9thermin et al. 2012). Because the deepest Herschel observations were carried out in fields such as GOODS and COSMOS with exceptional ancillary data, it is possible to stack in bins of photometric redshift to constrain the redshift distribution of the CIRB emission. At higher redshifts, the peak of dust emission from galaxies shifts to longer FIR and submillimeter wavelengths, and the fractional contribution of more-distant galaxies increases with the wavelength of the bandpass analyzed. Combining data from Spitzer through Herschel to ground-based submillimeter observations, B\u00e9thermin et al. (2012) estimated that 4.7 \u00b1 2.0 nW m\u22122 sr\u22121, or 17+11\n\u22129% of the integrated CIRB, is produced by galaxies at z>2. Although the fraction is small, it still allows for a significant amount of dusty star formation to take place at z>2, beyond what is seen in directly detected sources. However, the 24-\u03bcm sources used for these stacking analyses are also subject to strong k-correction dimming at z>2. Thus, a larger fraction of the high-redshift CIRB may have been missed.", "Among the nebular emission lines that have been most frequently used to quantify SFRs at high redshift, H\u03b1 is arguably the most useful (see Section 3.1.4). Lines from other elements, most commonly [Oii] 3,727 \u00c5, have also been used to measure the cosmic SFR (e.g., Hogg et al. 1998), but their more complex dependence on metallicity and ISM conditions as well as their larger extinction make them problematic. Narrow-band Ly\u03b1 surveys are popular at high redshift, but Ly\u03b1 is so strongly subject to resonant scattering and extinction that it must always be regarded as setting only a lower limit on the true SFR.", "H\u03b1 is accessible with optical observations only at z<0.5, and NIR observations are needed to follow it out to higher redshifts (z\u22722.5). Recent technological developments in IR instrumentation have significantly increased the potential for such measurements. A new generation of wide-field imagers using mosaics of IR arrays is now operating on 4-m- and 8-m-class telescopes (e.g., UKIRT WFCAM, CFHT WIRCAM, NOAO NEWFIRM, VISTA VIRCAM, VLT HAWK-I), thereby significantly increasing the comoving volumes accessible for deep narrow-band imaging. NIR multiobject spectrographs are now becoming mature and efficient (e.g., Subaru MOIRCS and FMOS, Keck MOSFIRE, VLT KMOS, LBT LUCI). Slitless grism spectroscopy with WFC3 on the HST can measure faint H\u03b1 lines out to z<1.5 for all objects within its field of view. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Narrow-band imaging surveys are tuned to specific, narrow redshift ranges and are strongly subject to density variations due to line-of-sight clustering effects. Flux calibration for objects whose redshifts place emission lines in the wings of the narrow bandpasses can also be problematic. Only statistical corrections can be made for the flux contribution from [Nii] or for stellar absorption. Multislit spectroscopy is subject to slit losses that complicate measurements of integrated line fluxes, and atmospheric absorption and emission significantly limit the accessible redshifts and can introduce complicated selection effects. (The new VLT KMOS spectrograph uses multiple deployable integral field units, thus eliminating slit-loss concerns, and may prove to be a valuable tool for H\u03b1 surveys.) HST WFC3 slitless spectroscopy avoids concerns about the atmosphere and slit losses, but deep observations covering adequately large solid angles are time intensive. As of this writing, results on H\u03b1 LFs from the largest ongoing programs [WISPS (Atek et al. 2010) and 3D-HST (Brammer et al. 2012)] have not appeared in the literature to supersede earlier HST NICMOS results (Yan et al. 1999, Hopkins et al. 2000, Shim et al. 2009). With all methods, reliable extinction corrections depend on the measurement of the Balmer decrement (the ratio of H\u03b1 to H\u03b2 line fluxes). This is rarely available for narrow-band surveys, but it is sometimes available for spectroscopic samples. However, in such cases, the sample selection is often limited by the weaker H\u03b2 line. Hence, statistical corrections are often adopted. AGN and LINERs can also contribute significantly to the samples of emission line galaxies and can be reliably taken into account only using high-quality spectroscopic data to measure line-excitation diagnostics. Most careful studies of the local galaxy population using spectroscopy from SDSS or GAMA (see below) have done this, but it is rarely possible at higher redshifts. Thus, most studies have resorted to statistical corrections or none at all.", "Much literature discusses LF and SFRD measurements from H\u03b1, [Oii] and [Oiii], and we note only selected works here. Gunawardhana et al. (2013) included a thorough and up-to-date compilation of these measurements at low and high redshifts. Using objective prism photographic data, Gallego et al. (1995) presented an important early study of the local H\u03b1 LF. Subsequently, the SDSS provided a vast number of spectroscopic redshifts and line-flux measurements, although the small aperture size of the spectroscopic fibers requires careful and inevitably uncertain corrections to the total emission line flux for each galaxy. SDSS spectroscopy covers both H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 and can provide a measurement of extinction via the Balmer decrement, although care is needed to account for stellar absorption, flux limits, and selection effects. Brinchmann et al. (2004) conducted a widely cited study of local star formation from SDSS optical spectroscopy and photometry. They used a full analysis of the emission and absorption line spectroscopy. Thus, their study was not strictly based on H\u03b1 alone, although the Balmer lines carry significant weight in the SFR determinations. As noted above, Salim et al. (2007) carried out an independent SDSS analysis based mainly on photometry including GALEX UV measurements but with extensive cross comparison to the H\u03b1 data. By using photometry, the Salim analysis bypasses uncertainties inherent in the spectroscopic H\u03b1 aperture corrections. The local SFRDs (normalized to z = 0.1) from the studies by Brinchmann et al. (2004) and Salim et al. (2007) agree extremely well. Most recently, Gunawardhana et al. (2013) combined data from the SDSS with significantly deeper (but also much smaller) fiber spectroscopy from the GAMA survey to probe fainter down the LF and extend the analysis to higher redshifts (z<0.35).", "Optical spectroscopic surveys have measured H\u03b1 SFRDs typically out to z<0.4 (e.g., Tresse & Maddox 1998, Sullivan et al. 2000, Westra et al. 2010, Gunawardhana et al. 2013). Until recently, NIR spectroscopy was measured only for small samples, object by object, typically at 0.5<z<1.1 (Glazebrook et al. 1999, Tresse et al. 2002, Doherty et al. 2006). In general, nebular line extinction is not directly measured and can only be assumed. The same is true for corrections for stellar absorption. Larger-scale and deeper spectroscopic surveys from a new generation of multiobject IR spectrographs on 8\u201310-m telescopes should be forthcoming.", "Several studies have exploited slitless grism spectroscopy of H\u03b1 at 0.7<z<1.9 from the HST NICMOS instrument (Yan et al. 1999, Hopkins et al. 2000, Shim et al. 2009). These studies are of small but relatively unbiased samples that are observed with relatively uniform sensitivity over a broad redshift range and without concerns for flux losses due to a finite spectrograph slit size. Once again, direct measurements of extinction are generally unavailable, and the low-resolution slitless spectroscopy inextricably blends H\u03b1 with [Nii], thus requiring purely statistical corrections. New, more sensitive grism surveys with HST WFC3 that cover larger solid angles are under way.", "The largest number of high-redshift measurements has come from narrow-band imaging surveys using wide-field CCD cameras out to z\u22480.4 and with IR arrays at higher redshifts. These are generally carried out using filters that fit into spectral windows relatively unaffected by atmospheric absorption or emission and that correspond to specific redshifts (z = 0.24, 0.40, 0.84, 1.47, and 2.23 are all common). Using a new generation of wide-field imagers, the current state-of-the-art H\u03b1 surveys include those of Ly et al. (2007, 2011), Hayes et al. (2010), and Sobral et al. (2013). The latter survey (HiZELS) combines data from Subaru Suprime-Cam (z = 0.40) and UKIRT WFCAM (z = 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23): It covers \u223c2 deg2 in two survey fields, with deeper but narrower (0.03 deg2) observations at z = 2.23 from the VLT and its HAWK-I imager. Between 500 and 1750 H\u03b1 emitters are detected in each redshift window, thereby providing good statistics. These authors measured a steady increase in the characteristic luminosity L\u2217(H\u03b1) with redshift and a faint-end slope \u03b1\u22481.6 that is constant with redshift and is also similar to that found in most of the UV continuum surveys.", "Centimeter-wavelength radio continuum emission from star-forming galaxies arises from a combination of flat-spectrum free-free emission, which is prominent at high frequencies, and steep spectrum synchrotron emission, which dominates at lower frequencies. Although the free-free emission should be a direct tracer of star-formation rates, it has been impractical to observe this at high redshift. However, the improved high-frequency sensitivity of the Jansky VLA should open this capability in the future. The lower-frequency emission arises mainly as a consequence of SNe. As such, it is also related to the SFR. In practice, its calibration as an SFR measurement is primarily empirical, e.g., based on the tight correlation observed between radio and far-IR emission for IRAS-selected galaxies in the local Universe (e.g., Yun et al. 2001). This correlation together with insensitivity to dust extinction makes radio emission an attractive wavelength for studying star formation.", "Problematically, AGN can also produce powerful radio emission. Locally, radio sources with L\n\u03bd(1.4GHz)>1023 W Hz\u22121 are predominantly AGN. This radio luminosity corresponds to an SFR >94M\u2299 year\u22121, using the conversion factor from Murphy et al. (2011) scaled to a Salpeter IMF. Such galaxies are extremely rare locally, so very powerful radio sources are commonly excluded as likely AGN. However, at z>1, galaxies with these SFRs (corresponding to ULIRGs in terms of their IR luminosities) are common, even \u201cnormal\u201d (see Section 3.1.2). Thus, it is problematic to disregard them simply on the basis of their radio emission. Other considerations are needed to distinguish AGN from star-forming radio sources, such as radio spectral index, radio morphology, or radio/IR flux ratios, but these are all more difficult to measure, especially for very faint sources.", "The local radio LF has been used to estimate the current SFRD in many studies (for recent examples, see Machalski & Godlowski 2000, Condon et al. 2002, Sadler et al. 2002, Serjeant et al. 2002, Mauch & Sadler 2007). In these studies, the authors carefully employed various criteria to separate AGN from star-forming galaxies. Data were often compared with IRAS IR measurements and excluded objects with a radio excess relative to their IR luminosities.", "At z>1, even the deepest VLA surveys have been able to detect galaxies with SFRs only \u2273100M\u2299 year\u22121 (\nFigure 1\n) and \u22731, 000M\u2299 year\u22121 at z>3, although the Jansky VLA is now pushing to fainter sensitivities. Haarsma et al. (2000) were among the first to combine very deep VLA observations with spectroscopic and photometric redshift information to derive radio LFs and the cosmic SFRD at high redshift, primarily at 0.3<z<0.8. However, they also considered one very broad bin from 1<z<4.4. Based on individually detected radio sources, this work was updated in later studies that took advantage of more extensive multiwavelength data to distinguish AGN from star-forming galaxies. Seymour et al. (2008) identified AGN based on radio spectral indexes, radio morphology, and radio to NIR and MIR flux ratios. Smol\u010di\u0107 et al. (2009) used optical SED criteria to identify star-forming galaxies detected in VLA 1.4 GHz data for COSMOS at more modest redshifts z<1.3. Seymour et al. (2008) assumed pure luminosity evolution for the LF, consistent with the measurements by Smol\u010di\u0107 et al. (2009) (and earlier by Haarsma et al. 2000). All these studies found broad agreement between the radio SFRD evolution and optical and IR surveys, noting a steep decline from z = 1 to 0; Seymour et al. (2008) measured a peak SFRD at z\u22481.5, albeit with large uncertainties.", "Other studies have used radio stacking to probe to fainter luminosities below the detection limits for individual sources\u2014particularly, stacking for NIR samples that approximate stellar mass selection. Here, the assumption is that, as in the local Universe, radio sources at fainter luminosities will primarily trace star formation with relatively little AGN contribution. Dunne et al. (2009) stacked VLA 1.4 GHz and GMRT 610 MHz data for K-band-selected sources in bins of redshift and K-band luminosity. They found a linear (but redshift-dependent) relation between radio and NIR luminosity. Using a measurement of the evolving K-band LF from the same data set, they then used this radio/NIR ratio to extrapolate the observations to the total radio luminosity density and SFRD. Karim et al. (2011) used a large 1.4-GHz survey of COSMOS and a Spitzer 3.6-\u03bcm-selected sample to carry out the most extensive study of this sort to date. Stacking in bins of stellar mass and photometric redshift and converting the mean radio fluxes to SFRs, they extensively analyzed the SFR-M\u2217 correlation and used this and the evolving stellar mass function (SMF) (from Ilbert et al. 2010) to compute the integrated SFRD. Dunne et al. (2009) measured a steady increase in the SFRD from z\u22480 to a peak at z\u22481.5 that declined at higher redshift to z\u22484. By contrast, Karim et al. (2011) found a monotonic decline in the SFRD from z = 3 to today.", "As the technology of NIR detectors advanced, so did surveys that used NIR photometry to better sample galaxies by stellar mass at both low and high redshifts (e.g., Cowie et al. 1996, Gavazzi et al. 1996). However, it was not until the turn of the millennium that authors started to routinely use stellar population synthesis models to convert photometry and redshift information to stellar masses for large samples of galaxies, especially at high redshift. Before the era of large, modern redshift surveys such as the SDSS and the 2dFGRS, several authors made estimates of the local baryonic densities and SMDs (Persic & Salucci 1992; Fukugita et al. 1998; Salucci & Persic 1999). This effort accelerated, however, as new spectroscopic surveys mapped the local Universe. Cole et al. (2001) used 2dFGRS redshifts and NIR photometry from 2MASS to measure the local K-band LF more accurately than had previously been possible. Then, using stellar population modeling, they inferred stellar masses from the galaxy colors and luminosities and derived the local galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and the local comoving SMD. Bell et al. (2003) did the same using SDSS and 2MASS. Many studies have subsequently derived the GSMF from incrementally improving SDSS data releases, using additional ancillary data and a variety of methods for stellar population modeling; mass-to-light ratios are sometimes derived from photometry and from the SDSS spectra (Panter et al. 2007, Baldry et al. 2008, Li & White 2009). Moustakas et al. (2013) incorporated photometry from the UV (GALEX) to the MIR (WISE) in their analysis of the SDSS GSMF. Baldry et al. (2012) analyzed a sample from GAMA, a wide-area spectroscopic survey extending significantly fainter than the SDSS, modeling M/L from optical SDSS photometry. As the samples have grown larger, more elaborate functional forms have been fit to the GSMF, including double and even triple Schechter functions, and there is some evidence that the GSMF slope at low masses (<109\nM\n\u2299) may be steeper than was previously believed (e.g., \u03b1=\u22121.47) (Baldry et al. 2012). Other authors have modeled stellar populations for ensembles of galaxies rather than deriving individual galaxy stellar masses, e.g., by fitting the integrated local luminosity densities for the entire local volume from UV to NIR wavelengths (Baldry & Glazebrook 2003) or by modeling coadded SDSS spectra in bins of luminosity, velocity dispersion, and 4,000-\u00c5 break strength (Gallazzi et al. 2008).", "At higher redshifts, Brinchmann & Ellis (2000) derived stellar masses for galaxies at z<1 in fields with both HST and NIR imaging. As expected given the declining cosmic SFRD at those redshifts, they found relatively little evolution in the integrated mass density at 0.4<z<0.9 but a marked evolution in the mass breakdown by morphological type. Cohen (2002) similarly found no significant evolution in the SMD at 0.25<z<1.05. Because the cosmic SFRD declines steeply with time at z<1, relatively little new stellar mass accumulates in the late stages of cosmic history. Moustakas et al. (2013) recently broke new ground with a low-resolution prism spectroscopic survey measuring \u223c40,000 redshifts for galaxies at 0.2<z<1 in five fields with Spitzer IRAC photometry covering 5.5 deg2. Even with such outstanding data, the evolution in the overall SMF at 0<z<1 is nearly imperceptible, but the migration of galaxies from the star-forming to the quiescent population is confirmed with exquisite detail.", "\nSawicki & Yee (1998), Giallongo et al. (1998), Papovich et al. (2001), and Shapley et al. (2001) pioneered the use of stellar population models to derive stellar masses for LBGs at z \u2248 2\u20133. Giallongo et al. (1998) computed comoving SMDs out to z \u2248 4 for galaxies from a relatively bright, optically selected sample, and measured steep evolution, but did not attempt to correct for unobserved galaxies fainter than the limits of their data. Subsequently, Dickinson et al. (2003), Fontana et al. (2003), and Rudnick et al. (2003) used the deepest NIR imaging then available for the two HDFs, HST NICMOS (HDF-N) and VLT ISAAC (HDF-S), together with extensive photometric and spectroscopic redshifts to derive the comoving SMD in several redshift bins out to z\u22483. Strong evolution was found over that longer redshift baseline; the SMD at z\u22483 measured in the range 5% to 15% of its present-day value, although a somewhat broader range of values would be permitted if systematic assumptions about the galaxy SFHs or stellar metallicities were pushed well beyond the range of models used for standard analysis. The SMD reached half its present-day value somewhere between z = 2 and 1. Strong cosmic variance in these small fields was also evident: At z>2, red galaxies with high mass-to-light ratios were nearly absent in the HDF-N but were found in moderate abundance in the HDF-S. By contrast, the corresponding SMDs differed substantially. This indicated the importance of surveying larger fields and more sightlines, but obtaining IR imaging to satisfactory depth over these larger regions of sky has proven to be very challenging and has required another decade of effort.", "The launch of Spitzer and the impressive performance of its IRAC camera for imaging at 3.6 to 8 \u03bcm made it possible to measure rest-frame NIR photometry for galaxies at high redshift, and major public survey imaging campaigns such as GOODS, S-COSMOS, and SWIRE produced widely accessible and heavily used imaging data sets spanning a wide range of area-depth parameter space, ideal for deriving SMFs and densities at high redshift. Indeed, NIR imaging has struggled to catch up with IRAC in terms of comparable area-depth coverage. Despite the vast swaths of telescope time that have been invested in obtaining NIR data on popular fields such as GOODS and COSMOS, imaging at 1 to 2.5 \u03bcm still tends to fall short of Spitzer's sensitivity at 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm. At z>4.5, the ground-based K-band samples rest-frame UV wavelengths, and IRAC offers the only viable way to measure optical rest-frame light to constrain stellar masses.", "From 2006 onward, most (although not all) papers on SMFs and densities at high redshift have made use of IRAC data\u2014often in the same survey fields that are repeatedly analyzed. Among many other papers, Fontana et al. (2006), P\u00e9rez-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2008), Kajisawa et al. (2009), and Marchesini et al. (2009) analyzed stellar masses in the GOODS fields (sometimes in combination with other data sets) for galaxies out to z\u22484. Arnouts et al. (2007), Pozzetti et al. (2010), Ilbert et al. (2010), and Brammer et al. (2011) analyzed wider-area but shallower surveys (e.g., COSMOS, VVDS-SWIRE, NMBS), generally focusing on redshifts z\u2a7d2. Despite differences in their methodologies, the conclusions of these papers painted a remarkably consistent picture of the evolution of the SMF at 0<z<3, with very little change in its shape, characteristic mass M\u2217, or faint-end slope, but with steady evolution in the characteristic density \u03d5\\*. There are indications that the faint-end slope of the mass function may steepen at higher redshifts (e.g., Kajisawa et al. 2009, Santini et al. 2012). The integrated SMDs measured in the different analyses generally agreed within factors of 2 at most redshifts, and a consistent picture of mass build-up emerged.", "Some of the most recent additions to this literature have taken advantage of deeper, wider NIR imaging from the largest-format cameras on 4-m-class telescopes (Bielby et al. 2012, Ilbert et al. 2013, Muzzin et al. 2013) to map relatively wide survey areas such as COSMOS or the CFHT Legacy Survey fields to depths previously reserved for small, deep surveys such as GOODS. Together with ever-growing spectroscopic surveys and increasingly excellent photometric redshifts, these have yielded the most statistically robust measurements of the SMFs at z<2.5. However, several of these surveys repeat analysis in COSMOS. Some even use essentially the same imaging data sets, so these analyses are not always robust against cosmic variance.", "\nSpitzer IRAC has been essential for deriving stellar masses at z>4, and very deep observations are necessary to detect typical galaxies at those redshifts. For this reason, nearly all analyses of SMDs at z>4 have been carried out in GOODS and the HUDF [in a departure from the GOODS-dominated norm, McLure et al. (2009) stacked relatively shallow IRAC data for LBGs at z = 5 and 6 in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey to measure average SEDs and mass-to-light ratios and, hence, to estimate the SMD], and nearly all have studied UV-selected LBGs, for which there are abundant samples. Early analyses of small samples of galaxies at z = 5 and 6, including estimates of the integrated SMD, were presented by Yan et al. (2006), Eyles et al. (2007), Stark et al. (2007), Verma et al. (2007), and Yabe et al. (2009). These were followed by larger and more systematic analyses of LBG samples at 4\u2a7ez\u2a7e7 (Stark et al. 2009, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2012), all of which used similar procedures and found broadly similar results. In particular, the derived LBG SMFs have somewhat shallower low-mass slopes than do the UVLFs, because M/LUV\n decreases at fainter UV luminosities, at least at z = 4 and 5 where this could be measured with some robustness from galaxies with individual IRAC detections (e.g., Lee et al. 2012). Using HST WFC3-selected samples in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS fields, Labb\u00e9 et al. (2013) recently extended this analysis to z\u22488.", "Exceptionally, some studies have used IRAC selection to avoid the potential bias of UV selection against older or dustier galaxies. Caputi et al. (2011) analyzed an IRAC 4.5-\u03bcm-selected sample in the UKIDSS Ultradeep Survey, thereby computing SMDs at 3\u2a7dz\u2a7d5. The depth of their IRAC data limited direct detections to a stellar mass completeness limit \u22731010.4M\u2299. Their extrapolated mass densities based on Schechter function fits fall somewhat below those from other LBG-based studies (e.g., Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2012), but this is likely due to uncertainties in the large extrapolation required. Several other authors have analyzed partially or wholly IRAC-selected candidates for massive galaxies at z\u22733.5 (Wiklind et al. 2008, Mancini et al. 2009, Marchesini et al. 2010, Caputi et al. 2012). In some cases, they have estimated comoving SMDs, although generally without fitting SMFs and often without rigorous analysis of sample completeness.", "Several studies have suggested that LBGs at z\u22734 have much stronger optical rest-frame nebular line emission (particularly H\u03b1 and [Oiii]) than do similar UV-selected galaxies at lower redshifts (Chary et al. 2005, Raiter et al. 2010, Shim et al. 2011, Labb\u00e9 et al. 2013, Stark et al. 2013). In most cases, this has been inferred on the basis of Spitzer IRAC colors that would be unusual for pure stellar populations but that can be explained if strong line emission boosts the IRAC fluxes. This line emission, if not taken into account, can significantly affect derived stellar population parameters and generally leads to overestimated stellar masses. For LBG samples at z = 4 to 8, Stark et al. (2013) and Labb\u00e9 et al. (2013) estimated that average stellar masses derived from models without nebular lines should be reduced by factors from 10% to 70%, with the effect increasing at higher redshifts. Although the photometric evidence for this strong nebular emission is compelling, it will be vitally important for JWST spectroscopy to confirm and quantify its effects.", "Galaxy evolution surveys have amassed a remarkable wealth of new data in the past two decades. Newer, larger, and deeper surveys have supplanted earlier work and have provided more statistically robust measurements of the SFR and stellar mass densities at many different redshifts. Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in even the best data or in our use of those data, which may significantly limit the accuracy or reliability of measurements of the cosmic SFH. Here we consider the strengths and weaknesses of the best measurements to date, from the local Universe out to the highest redshifts.", "To be statistically meaningful, measurements of the current SFR or SMD require surveys covering a large fraction of the sky. Salim et al. (2007) and Robotham & Driver (2011) used most or all of the GALEX Medium Imaging Survey data, covering \u223c1,000 deg2 overlapping the SDSS and 2dFGRS spectroscopic surveys, and there is little prospect for improving the UV data in the near future. Only refinements in the analysis can be expected, e.g., incorporating improved photometric data at optical or NIR wavelengths, or further joint analysis with spectroscopic stellar population measurements. As discussed below (Section 5.1) (\nFigure 8\n), there is significant disagreement in the literature about the net FUV extinction correction at z\u22480. Wide-area spectroscopic emission line surveys (e.g., from SDSS or GAMA) (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Gunawardhana et al. 2013) are limited by uncertain aperture corrections to line fluxes, whereas narrow-band imaging surveys have yet to cover enough galaxies over a wide enough area and are usually limited by the absence of direct measurements of extinction from the Balmer decrement, the [Nii] contribution to H\u03b1 measurements, or the contribution of AGN emission. There is still room for progress in combined narrow-band plus spectroscopic data for large local samples. The local FIRLF has not been drastically revised since the final IRAS analyses (Sanders et al. 2003, Takeuchi et al. 2003); additional AKARI data did not drastically change earlier results (Goto et al. 2011a,b; Sedgwick et al. 2011). The biggest remaining uncertainties pertain to the faint-end slope, where measurements vary significantly from \u03b1=\u22121.2 to \u22121.8 (or, somewhat implausibly, even \u22122.0) (e.g., Goto et al. 2011b). Analysis of the widest-area FIR surveys from Herschel, such as H-ATLAS (570 deg2) (Eales et al. 2010), may help with this. The present uncertainties lead to a difference of a factor of at least 2 to 3 in the local FIR luminosity density. Nevertheless, as previously noted, in today's relatively \u201cdead\u201d epoch of cosmic star formation, a significant fraction of the FIR emission from ordinary spiral galaxies may arise from dust heated by intermediate-age and older stellar populations, not newly formed OB stars. Hence, it is not necessarily the best measure of the SFR. At higher redshifts, when the cosmic-specific SFR was much larger, new star formation should dominate dust heating, making the IR emission a more robust global tracer.\n", "", "\n Figure 8\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Local measurements of the SMD have relied mainly on purely optical data (e.g., SDSS photometry and spectroscopy) or on relatively shallow NIR data from 2MASS. There may still be concerns about missing light, surface brightness biases, etc., in the 2MASS data (e.g., Bell et al. 2003), and deeper very-wide-field NIR data would be helpful. All-sky MIR data from WISE may be valuable and have been used by Moustakas et al. (2013), but without extensive analysis specifically focused on this topic. Deeper NIR data covering a significant fraction of the sky, either from new wide-field ground-based NIR telescopes with large apertures or from space-based surveys with EUCLID or WFIRST, would make a valuable new contribution. Otherwise, as for UV SFRs, the most likely improvements will come from refined stellar population analyses, rather than from new data.", "During the decline and fall of cosmic star formation, from z\u22481 to 0, the greatest weakness of current measurements is that they have generally covered small sky areas and small comoving volumes over few independent sightlines. Hence, they may be subject to significant cosmic variance uncertainties. Fields such as GOODS, which have been analyzed many times, are too small to offer precision measurements in fine redshift bins at z<1. Even the 2 deg2 COSMOS field subtends less than 100 Mpc at z<1 and can be spanned by large-scale structure; as a single sightline, it is subject to density fluctuations. Although very good data for measuring the SFRD or SMD at z<1 exist in many fields, relatively little information has been analyzed thoroughly, in part because intensive effort on spectroscopic (or even photometric) redshifts has been applied to only the few, most famous fields. Sometimes, even fields such as AEGIS, which has outstanding spectroscopy and deep GALEX, Spitzer, and Herschel data, have not been fully exploited for this purpose.", "For example, very deep GALEX data exist for several of the most famous survey fields, but the one widely cited analysis of the UV luminosity density at z<1 (Schiminovich et al. 2005) uses only \u223c1,000 sources with redshifts in a single 0.5-deg2 field. Expanded analysis of comparably deep GALEX data in COSMOS, AEGIS, and several other survey fields with existing, extensive spectroscopy is long overdue. There are no opportunities to collect more GALEX data, but deep U-band imaging measuring somewhat longer rest-frame UV wavelengths may be quite adequate for many purposes. Such data exist or could be obtained with wide-field imagers, but the best analysis to date (Cucciati et al. 2012), using \u223c11,000 spectroscopic redshifts, is limited to a single 0.6-deg2 sightline [indeed, the same field analyzed by Schiminovich et al. (2005) with GALEX]. Much more work can be done to improve this situation, with relatively limited new observational effort and often using data that already exist.", "Similarly, most analyses of MIR and FIR data from Spitzer and Herschel data have used data from, at most, three independent sightlines (e.g., Magnelli et al. 2009, Rodighiero et al. 2010, Gruppioni et al. 2013), nearly always combining the two GOODS fields with one shallower but wider data set (e.g., COSMOS or the VVDS-SWIRE field). The widest-area analysis to date is that of Rujopakarn et al. (2010), which used 24-\u03bcm-selected sources at z<0.65 from the 9-deg2 Bo\u00f6tes survey. In practice, more data over more sightlines exist. Large consortium surveys such as the PEP and HerMES Herschel Guaranteed Time programs have mapped many fields, often with an elegant hierarchy of different areas and depths, but these have not yet been exploited and combined into a single, definitive analysis. Typically, this is because the ancillary imaging and spectroscopy needed to identify IR source counterparts and to determine their redshifts is available or adequate in only a few fields (hence, the repeated analyses of GOODS and COSMOS).", "Many of these same comments apply to SMD estimates at z<1. In this case, the state of the art has recently been improved by Moustakas et al. (2013), who analyzed five independent fields with a combined solid angle of 5.5 deg2 with (relatively shallow) IRAC photometry and (low-resolution) spectroscopic redshifts. This is the best combination of area, depth, number of sightlines, and redshift quality for any study of the SMD at z<1 and is also superior to any data used to date for SFRD studies at similar redshifts. Deeper ground-based NIR data were used by Bielby et al. (2012), who analyzed four fields covering 2.1 deg2, and by several studies of the single 2-deg2 COSMOS field (e.g., Ilbert et al. 2013). New wide-area surveys such as VISTA VIDEO (Jarvis 2012) (ground-based NIR, three fields, 12 deg2) and SERVS (Mauduit et al. 2012) (Spitzer IRAC, five fields, 18 deg2, overlapping VIDEO) will provide excellent new data to improve mass function estimates, but only if adequate redshift information and supporting optical photometry are available.", "At z>1, deep surveys are needed to probe typical (L\u2217 and fainter) luminosities and to directly detect the majority of cosmic star formations. In principle, many fields have suitable data. However, in practice, a few survey fields have been reanalyzed many times, in part because they have the best spectroscopic and photometric redshift measurements and in part because they have the richest multiwavelength data. As such, they are magnets for studies of all kinds. In the UV, the 1,500-\u00c5 rest frame is easily probed at z>1.5 using ground-based or HST optical imaging. At z\u22482 and 3, the surveys of LBGs by Steidel and collaborators (e.g., Reddy & Steidel 2009) cover many independent sightlines. They offer excellent control of cosmic variance and have outstanding spectroscopic calibration. UV selection is biased against dusty star formation, but for pure measurements of the UVLF, their surveys are arguably definitive. The best direct measurements of dust emission from Spitzer and Herschel are limited to fewer fields, and still fewer have the very deep data needed to probe galaxies near L\u2217. As described above, most analysis has revolved around GOODS and COSMOS, and even in GOODS, the Herschel data only barely reach L\u2217 at z = 2. The faint-end slope of the IRLF is not directly constrained by individually detected sources at z>2, leading to potentially large uncertainties in any extrapolation to the bolometric IR luminosity density. With no more sensitive FIR space missions on the horizon, there is little prospect for wide-area surveys to fainter flux limits. ALMA can reach fainter submillimeter continuum limits and detect dust continuum from ordinary galaxies at very high redshifts, but only for very small solid angles. Mosaics of hundreds or even thousands of pointings would be needed to survey a field the size of GOODS. Well-designed observations targeting intelligently selected galaxy samples, rather than panoramic mapping, may be required.", "Stellar masses below the characteristic mass M\u2217 can be probed using the best ground-based NIR data and using Spitzer IRAC even with modest integration times. Thus, more fields have been analyzed, although GOODS and COSMOS still tend to dominate the literature. The extended Spitzer warm mission generated a wealth of valuable data that has yet to be fully exploited. In practice, there is uncannily good agreement between most determinations of the SMF and density at 1<z<4, and it is not clear that new surveys are needed, rather than more sophisticated analysis of the existing data. However, the CANDELS HST WFC3 survey reaches fainter multiband NIR fluxes in fields that already have the deepest IRAC data and, hence, provides an important opportunity for measuring photometric redshifts and stellar masses for galaxies fainter than the limits of most studies to date. This should provide a better constraint on the slope of the SMF at low masses.", "At z\u2a7e4, the large majority of UV-based SFR and SMD measurements have been derived from HST data, mainly in the GOODS fields and the HUDF plus its deep parallel fields (also located in and around GOODS-South). Although ground-based imaging can select galaxies at z\u2a7e4, in practice the HST surveys have gone deeper, especially at the very red optical wavelengths (I- and z-bands) and the NIR wavelengths needed to select galaxies at the highest redshifts; only with these data can LF measurements probe significantly fainter than L\u2217. GOODS also has the deepest Spitzer IRAC data, essential for deriving stellar masses at z>4, where even the K-band samples rest-frame UV wavelengths. Although the comoving volumes in the GOODS fields are significant at these large redshifts (nearly 106 comoving Mpc3 at z = 4 for the combined GOODS fields), one may still worry about clustering and cosmic variance, given only two sightlines. The CANDELS program (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011) is obtaining multiband optical and NIR HST imaging over five fields, each similar in size, including the two GOODS fields. This program is supplemented by very deep IRAC imaging from SEDS (Ashby et al. 2013) and S-CANDELS (G. Fazio, research in progress) and will help with cosmic variance control and improved statistics.", "At 68, the HUDF (or lensing clusters) are needed to detect convincing candidates. Hence, nearly all the literature on the SFRD or stellar masses at these redshifts consists of serial and parallel analyses of the same HUDF data sets as well as recent work from CLASH (Zheng et al. 2012, Coe et al. 2013). Here, the new Hubble Frontier Fields should be important. This program, to be executed from 2013 to 2016, will obtain multiband optical and NIR HST imaging with near-HUDF depth along with ultradeep Spitzer IRAC data for six massive galaxy clusters. Its lensing potential will magnify the faintest high-redshift background galaxies. In addition, there will be six new \u201cblank\u201d parallel fields that will improve statistics for unlensed sources and provide cosmic variance control for analyses that now depend on the HUDF (and its satellites) alone.", "At z>4, galaxies detected in ground-based NIR data (and at z>3 for HST observations in the reddest WFC3-IR filters) are observed at rest-frame UV wavelengths. Hence, even with CANDELS, the HUDF, and the Frontier Fields, HST selection will be biased against quiescent or dusty galaxies. Massive galaxies with huge SFRs that are detected at submillimeter wavelengths but invisible even out to the K-band have been detected. Redshifts z>4 have been confirmed from CO measurements (e.g., Daddi et al. 2009), but it is unknown how much they might contribute to the SFR or SMD. IRAC selection should, in principle, provide a less biased census (e.g., Mancini et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011; Caputi et al. 2011, 2012), but spectroscopic confirmation or even photometric redshift estimates for this population may prove to be very difficult before the launch of the JWST.", "\nEquation 1 was first used by Lanzetta et al. (1995) to study the chemical evolution of the damped Ly\u03b1 absorption systems, where one infers the comoving rate of star formation from the observed cosmological mass density of Hi;\nPei & Fall (1995) then generalized it to models with inflows and outflows. Madau et al. (1996, 1998b) and Lilly et al. (1996) developed a different method where data from galaxy surveys were used to infer the SFRD \u03c8(t) directly. This new approach relies on coupling the equations of chemical evolution to the spectrophotometric properties of the cosmic volume under consideration.

As an illustrative example of this technique, we provide in this section a current determination of the SFH of the Universe and discuss a number of possible implications.", "Rather than trying to be exhaustive, we base our modeling below on a limited number of contemporary (mostly post-2006) galaxy surveys (see \nTable 1\n). For the present purpose, we consider only surveys that have measured SFRs from rest-frame FUV (generally 1,500 \u00c5) or MIR and FIR measurements. Other surveys of nebular line or radio emission are also important, but they provide more limited or indirect information as discussed in previous sections (Sections 4.3 and 4.4). For the IR measurements, we emphasize surveys that make use of FIR data from Spitzer or Herschel, rather than relying on MIR (e.g., Spitzer 24-\u03bcm) measurements alone, owing to the complexity and lingering uncertainty over the best conversions from MIR luminosity to SFR, particularly at high redshift or high luminosity. In a few cases, we include older measurements when they are the best available, particularly for local luminosity densities from IRAS or GALEX, or GALEX-based measurements at higher redshifts that have not been updated since 2005.\n", "Determinations of the cosmic star-formation rate density from UV data (top group) and infrared data (bottom group) used in this review\n", "aIn our notation, AFUV\u2261\u22122.5log10\u3008kd\u3009.", "bAll our star-formation rate densities are based on the integration of the best-fit luminosity function parameters down to the same relative limiting luminosity, in units of the characteristic luminosity L\u2217, of Lmin=0.03L\u2217.

The integrated luminosity density has a strong dependence on L\nmin at high redshift, where the faint-end slope is measured to be very steep, i.e., \u03b1=\u22122.01\u00b10.21 at z\u223c7 and \u03b1=\u22121.91\u00b10.32 at z\u223c8 (Bouwens et al. 2011b). Slopes of \u03b1\u2272\u22122 lead to formally divergent luminosity densities. Our choice of a limiting luminosity that is 3.8 magnitudes fainter than L\u2217, although it samples a significant portion of the faint-end of the FUV LF, requires only a mild extrapolation (1.3 mag) from the deepest HST WFC3/IR observations (\u223c2.5 mag beyond L\u2217 at z \u223c 5\u20138) of the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011b). For the IR data, we use analytic or numerical integrations depending on the LF form adopted by each reference, but the same faint-end slope considerations apply.

This is the multiplicative factor needed to correct the observed FUV luminosity density to the intrinsic value before extinction or, equivalently, \u2329kd\n\u232a=\u03c1IR/\u03c1FUV+1 (e.g., Meurer et al. 1999). For most of the data shown in \nFigure 8\n, the attenuation has been estimated from the UV spectral slopes of star-forming galaxies using the attenuation-reddening relations from Meurer et al. (1999) or Calzetti et al. (2000) or occasionally from stellar population model fitting to the full UV-optical SEDs of galaxies integrated over the observed population (e.g., Salim et al. 2007, Cucciati et al. 2012). Robotham & Driver (2011) used the empirical attenuation correction of Driver et al. (2008). We note that the estimates of UV attenuation in the local Universe span a broad range, suggesting that more work needs to be done to firmly pin down this quantity (and perhaps implying that we should be cautious about the estimates at higher redshift). Several studies of UV-selected galaxies at z\u2a7e2 (Reddy & Steidel 2009, Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012b) have noted strong trends for less luminous galaxies as having bluer UV spectral slopes and, hence, lower inferred dust attenuation. Because the faint-end slope of the far-UV luminosity function (FUVLF) is so steep at high redshift, a large fraction of the reddened FUV luminosity density is emitted by galaxies much fainter than L\u2217; this extinction-luminosity trend also implies that the net extinction for the entire population will be a function of the faint integration limit for the sample. In \nFigure 8\n, the points from Reddy & Steidel (2009) (at z = 2.3 and 3.05) and from Bouwens et al. (2012a) (at 2.5\u2a7dz\u2a7d7) are shown for two faint-end integration limits: These are roughly down to the observed faint limit of the data, M\nFUV<\u221217.5 to \u221217.7 for the different redshift subsamples and extrapolated to L\nFUV=0. The net attenuation for the brighter limit, which more closely represents the sample of galaxies actually observed in the study, is significantly larger than for the extrapolation\u2014nearly two times larger for the Reddy & Steidel (2009) samples and by a lesser factor for the more distant objects from Bouwens et al. (2012a). In our analysis of the SFRDs, we have adopted the mean extinction factors inferred by each survey to correct the corresponding FUV luminosity densities.", "Adopting a different approach, Burgarella et al. (2013) measured total UV attenuation from the ratio of FIR to observed (uncorrected) FUV luminosity densities (\nFigure 8\n) as a function of redshift, using FUVLFs from Cucciati et al. (2012) and Herschel FIRLFs from Gruppioni et al. (2013). At z<2, these estimates agree reasonably well with the measurements inferred from the UV slope or from SED fitting. At z>2, the FIR/FUV estimates have large uncertainties owing to the similarly large uncertainties required to extrapolate the observed FIRLFs to a total luminosity density. The values are larger than those for the UV-selected surveys, particularly when compared with the UV values extrapolated to very faint luminosities. Although galaxies with lower SFRs may have reduced extinction, purely UV-selected samples at high redshift may also be biased against dusty star-forming galaxies. As we noted above, a robust census for star-forming galaxies at z\u226b2 selected on the basis of dust emission alone does not exist, owing to the sensitivity limits of past and present FIR and submillimeter observatories. Accordingly, the total amount of star formation that is missed from UV surveys at such high redshifts remains uncertain.", "\n\nFigure 9\n shows the cosmic SFH from UV and IR data following the above prescriptions as well as the best-fitting function", "\n", "", "These state-of-the-art surveys provide a remarkably consistent picture of the cosmic SFH: a rising phase, scaling as \u03c8(z)\u221d(1+z)\u22122.9 at 3\u2272z\u22728, slowing and peaking at some point probably between z = 2 and 1.5, when the Universe was \u223c3.5 Gyr old, followed by a gradual decline to the present day, roughly as \u03c8(z)\u221d(1+z)2.7. The comoving SFRD at redshift 7 was approximately the same as that measured locally. The increase in \u03c8(z) from z\u22488 to 3 appears to have been steady, with no sharp drop at the highest redshifts, although there is now active debate in the literature about whether that trend continues or breaks at redshifts 9 and beyond (Coe et al. 2013, Ellis et al. 2013, Oesch et al. 2013). Although we have adopted a fitting function that is a double power law in (1 + z), we note that the SFRD data at z<1 can also be fit quite well by an exponential decline with cosmic time and an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Compared with the recent empirical fit to the SFRD by Behroozi et al. (2013), the function in Equation 15 reaches its peak at a slightly higher redshift, with a lower maximum value of \u03c8 and with slightly shallower rates of change at both lower and higher redshift, and produces 20% fewer stars by z = 0.\n", "", "\n Figure 9\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "We also note that each published measurement has its own approach to computing uncertainties on the SFRD and takes different random and systematic factors into account, and we have made no attempt to rationalize these here.

We have instead adopted a fixed threshold of 0.03L\u2217 to integrate the published LFs, and given the covariance on the measurements and uncertainties of LF parameters, there is no simple way for us to correct the published uncertainties to be appropriate for our adopted integration limit. Therefore, we have simply retained the fractional errors on the SFRD measurements published by each author without modification to provide an indication of the relative inaccuracy derived by each study. These should not be taken too literally, especially when there is significant difference in the faint-end slopes of LFs reported in different studies, which can lead to large differences in the integrated luminosity density. Uncertainties in the faint-end slope and the resulting extrapolations are not always fully taken into account in published error analyses, especially when LFs are fit at high redshift by fixing the slope to some value measured only at lower redshift.", "Because core-collapse supernovae (CC SNe) (i.e., Type II and Ibc SNe) originate from massive, short-lived stars, the rates of these events should reflect ongoing star formation and offer an independent determination of the cosmic star formation and metal production rates at different cosmological epochs (e.g., Madau et al. 1998a, Dahlen et al. 2004). Although poor statistics and dust obscuration are major liming factors for using CC SNe as a tracer of the SFH of the Universe, most derived rates are consistent with each other and increase with lookback time between z = 0 and z\u223c1 (see \nFigure 10\n).

The IMF dependence in Equation 16 is largely canceled out by the IMF dependence of the derived SFRD \u03c8(z), as the stellar mass range probed by SFR indicators is comparable to the mass range of stars exploding as CC SNe. Recent comparisons between SFRs and CC SN rates have suggested a discrepancy between the two rates: The numbers of CC SNe detected are too low by a factor of approximately 2 (Horiuchi et al. 2011).

Recent studies of the GRB-SFR connection have claimed that GRBs do not trace the SFR in an unbiased way and are more frequent per unit stellar mass formed at early times (Kistler et al. 2009, Robertson & Ellis 2012, Trenti et al. 2012).", "\n\nFigure 11\n shows a compilation (see also \nTable 2\n) of recent (mostly post 2006) measurements of the SMD as a function of redshift (for a compilation of older data, see Wilkins et al. 2008a).

At high redshift, authors often extrapolate their SMFs beyond the observed range by fitting a Schechter function. Stellar mass completeness at any given redshift is rarely as well defined as luminosity completeness, given the broad range of M/L values that galaxies can exhibit. Unlike the LFs used for the SFRD calculations where we have tried to impose a consistent faint luminosity limit (relative to L\u2217) for integration, in most cases we have simply accepted whatever low-mass limits or integral values that the various authors reported. Many authors found that the characteristic mass M\u2217 appears to change little for 0<z<3 (e.g., Fontana et al. 2006, Ilbert et al. 2013) and is roughly 1011M\u2299 (Salpeter).

A common but by no means universal low-mass integration limit used in the literature is 108\nM\n\u2299.

We find little evidence for such significant discrepancies, although there does appear to be a net offset over a broad redshift range. Although smaller, a \u223c60% effect should not be disregarded. One can imagine several possible causes for this discrepancy; we consider several of them here.", "SFRs may be overestimated, particularly at high redshift during the peak era of galaxy growth. For UV-based measurements, a likely culprit may be the luminosity-weighted dust corrections, which could be too large, although it is often asserted that UV data are likely to underestimate SFRs in very dusty, luminous galaxies. IR-based SFRs may be overestimated and indeed were overestimated for some high-redshift galaxies in earlier Spitzer studies, although this seems less likely now in the era of deep Herschel FIR measurements. It seems more plausible that the SFRs inferred for individual galaxies may be correct on average but that the LF extrapolations could be too large. Many authors adopt fairly steep (\u03b1\u2a7e\u22121.6) faint-end slopes to both the UVLFs and IRLFs for distant galaxies. For the UVLFs, the best modern data constrain these slopes quite well, but in the IR current measurements are not deep enough to do so. However, although these extrapolations may be uncertain, the good agreement between the current best estimates of the UV- and IR-based SFRDs at 0<z<2.5 (\nFigure 9\n) does not clearly point to a problem in either one.", "Instead, stellar masses or their integrated SMD may be systematically underestimated. This is not implausible, particularly for star-forming galaxies, where the problem of recent star formation \u201coutshining\u201d older high-M/L stars is well known (see Section 5.1). By analyzing mock catalogs of galaxies drawn from simulations with realistic (and complex) SFHs, Pforr et al. (2012) found that the simplifying assumptions that are typically made when modeling stellar masses for real surveys generally lead to systematically underestimated stellar masses at all redshifts. That said, other systematic effects can work in the opposite direction and lead to mass overestimates, e.g., the effects of TP-AGB stars on the red and NIR light if these are not correctly modeled (Maraston 2005). A steeper low-mass slope to the GSMF could also increase the total SMD. This has been suggested even at z = 0, where mass functions have been measured with seemingly great precision and dynamic range (e.g., Baldry et al. 2008). At high redshift, most studies to date have found relatively flat low-mass SMF slopes, but galaxy samples may be incomplete (and photometric redshift estimates poor) for very faint, red, high-M/L galaxies if they exist in significant numbers. Some recent SMF determinations using very deep HST WFC3 observations have found steeper SMF slopes at z>1.5 (e.g., Santini et al. 2012), and new measurements from extremely deep NIR surveys such as CANDELS are eagerly anticipated. That said, it seems unlikely that the SMF slope at low redshift has been underestimated enough to account for a difference of 0.2 dex in the SMD.", "Recent evidence has suggested that strong nebular line emission can significantly affect broadband photometry for galaxies at high redshift, particularly z>3.8, where H\u03b1 (and, at z>5.3, [Oiii]) enter the Spitzer IRAC bands (Shim et al. 2011). Therefore, following Stark et al. (2013), we have divided the SMD of Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2011) at z\u22434, 5, 6, and 7 in \nFigure 11\n by the factor 1.1, 1.3, 1.6, and 2.4, respectively, to account for this effect. Although considerable uncertainties in these corrections remain, such downward revision to the inferred early SMD improves consistency with expectations from the time-integrated SFRD.", "Alternatively, some authors have considered how changing the IMF may help reconcile SMD(z) with the time-integrated SFRD(z) (e.g., Wilkins et al. 2008b). Generally, a more top-heavy or bottom-light IMF will lead to larger luminosities per unit SFR, hence smaller SFR/L conversion factors K (Section 3.1). Mass-to-light ratios for older stellar populations will also tend to be smaller, but not necessarily by the same factor. Although we have used a Salpeter IMF for reference in this review, an IMF with a low-mass turnover (e.g., Chabrier or Kroupa) will yield a larger mass return fraction R and proportionately lower final stellar masses for a given integrated past SFH by the factor (1\u2212R\n1)/(1\u2212R\n2)=0.81, where R\n1 and R\n2=0.41 and 0.27 for the Chabrier and Salpeter IMFs, respectively (Section 2). The apparent offset between the SMD data and our integrated model \u03c8(z) can be reduced further to only \u223c0.1 dex without invoking a particularly unusual IMF. Given the remaining potential for systemic uncertainties in the measurements of SFRDs and SMDs, it seems premature to tinker further with the IMF, although if discrepancies remain after further improvements in the measurements and modeling then this topic may be worth revisiting.", "In concordance with estimates from the cosmic SFH, the measurements of the SMD discussed above imply that galaxies formed the bulk (\u227375%) of their stellar mass at z<2. Stars formed in galaxies before 11.5 Gyr are predicted to contribute only 8% of the total stellar mass today. An important consistency check for all these determinations could come from studies of the past SFH of the Universe from its present contents. This \u201cfossil cosmology\u201d approach has benefited from large spectroscopic surveys in the local Universe such as the 2dFGRS (Colless et al. 2001) and the SDSS (York et al. 2000), which provide detailed spectral information for hundreds of thousands of galaxies. Using a sample of 1.7\u00d7105 galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR2 and comparing the spectrum of each galaxy to a library of templates by Bruzual & Charlot (2003) (the comparison was based on five spectral absorption features, namely D4,000, H\u03b2, and H\u03b4A+H\u03b3A as age-sensitive indexes and [Mg2Fe] and [MgFe]\u2032 as metal-sensitive indexes), Gallazzi et al. (2008) have constructed a distribution of stellar mass as a function of age (for a similar analysis on the SDSS DR3 sample, see also Panter et al. 2007).

Both distributions have a peak at 8\u201310 Gyr and decline rapidly at younger ages, with the peak age corresponding to the formation redshift, z\u223c2, where the cosmic star-formation density reaches a maximum. The SDSS distribution, however, appears to be skewed toward younger ages. This is partly caused by a bias toward younger populations in the SDSS \u201carchaeological\u201d approach, where individual galaxies are assigned only an average (weighted by mass or light) age that is closer to the last significant episode of star formation. Such bias appears to be reflected in \nFigure 12\n where the mass assembly history predicted by our model SFH is compared with that inferred by translating the characteristic age of the stellar populations measured by Gallazzi et al. (2008) into a characteristic redshift of formation. The agreement is generally good, although the SDSS distribution would predict later star formation and more rapid SMD growth at z<2 and correspondingly less stellar mass formed at z>2. The present-day total SMD derived by Gallazzi et al. (2008) is (6.0\u00b11.0)\u00d7108M\u2299 Mpc-3 (scaled up from a Chabrier to a Salpeter IMF), in excellent agreement with \u03c1\u2217=5.8\u00d7108M\u2299 Mpc-3 predicted by our model SFH.

The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M\u2217, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M\u2217 correlation. For the \u201cmain sequence\u201d of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a \u201cdownsizing\u201d picture first introduced by Cowie et al.

The tightness of this SFR-M\u2217 correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH.

The damped Ly\u03b1 absorption systems are detected in absorption (i.e., have no luminosity bias), and their large optical depths at the Lyman limit eliminate the need for uncertain ionization corrections to deduce metal abundances.

The enrichment of the circumgalactic medium, as probed in absorption by Ciii, Civ, Siiii, Siiv, Ovi, and other transitions, provides us with a record of past star formation and of the impact of galactic winds on their surroundings. \nFigure 14\n shows that the ionization-corrected metal abundances from Ovi absorption at z\u223c3 (Aguirre et al. 2008) and Civ absorption at z\u223c4 (Simcoe 2011) track well the predicted mean metallicity of the Universe, i.e., that these systems are an unbiased probe of the cosmic baryon cycle.", "The Universe at redshift 6 remains one of the most challenging observational frontiers, as the high opacity of the Ly\u03b1 forest inhibits detailed studies of hydrogen absorption along the line-of-sight to distant quasars. In this regime, the metal lines that fall longwards of the Ly\u03b1 emission take on a special significance as the only tool at our disposal to recognize individual absorption systems, whether in galaxies or the IGM, and probe cosmic enrichment following the earliest episodes of star formation. Here, we use recent surveys of high- and low-ionization intergalactic absorption to estimate the metallicity of the Universe at these extreme redshifts. According to Simcoe et al.

The lower bound to the rectangle centered at redshift 5.8 assumes no ionization correction, i.e., (Cii + Civ)/C = 1. To derive the upper bound, we adopt the conservative limit (Cii + Civ)/C \u2265 0.1; this is the minimum fractional abundance reached by Cii + Civ under the most favorable photoionization balance conditions at redshift 6. [To obtain this estimate, we have computed photoionization models based on the CLOUDY code (Ferland et al. 1998) assuming the UV radiation background at z = 6 of Haardt & Madau (2012) and a range of gas overdensities 0<log\u03b4<3.] If the ionization state of the early metal-bearing IGM is such that most of the C is either singly or triply ionized, then most of the heavy elements at these epochs appear to be \u201cmissing\u201d compared with the expectations based on the integral of the cosmic SFH (Pettini 2006, Ryan-Weber et al. 2009). Conversely, if Cii and Civ are only trace ion stages of carbon, then the majority of the heavy elements produced by stars 1 Gyr after the Big Bang (z = 6) may have been detected already.", "A simple argument can also be made against the possibility that our best-fit SFH significantly overpredicts the cosmic metallicity at these early epochs. The massive stars that explode as Type II SNe and seed the IGM with metals are also the sources of nearly all of the Lyman-continuum (LyC) photons produced by a burst of star formation. It is then relatively straightforward to link a given IGM metallicity to the minimum number of LyC photons that must have been produced up until that time. The close correspondence between the sources of metals and photons makes the conversion from one to the other largely independent of the details of the stellar IMF (Madau & Shull 1996). Specifically, the energy emitted in hydrogen ionizing radiation per baryon, E\nion, is related to the average cosmic metallicity by", "\n", "", "where mpc\n2=938 MeV is the rest mass of the proton and \u03b7 is the efficiency of conversion of the heavy element rest mass into LyC radiation.

An average energy of 22 eV per LyC photon together with our prediction of Zb\n=7\u00d710\u22124Z\u2299 (assuming a solar yield) at redshift 6 implies that approximately 8 LyC photons per baryon were emitted by early galaxies prior to this epoch. Although at least one photon per baryon is needed for reionization to occur, this is a reasonable value because the effect of hydrogen recombinations in the IGM and within individual halos will likely boost the number of photons required. A global metallicity at z = 6 that was much lower than our predicted value would effectively create a deficit of UV radiation and leave the reionization of the IGM unexplained. In Section 5.8 below, we link the production of LyC photons to stellar mass, show that the efficiency of LyC production decreases with increasing Z\u2217, and discuss early star formation and the epoch of reionization in more detail.", "Direct dynamical measurements show that most local massive galaxies host a quiescent massive black hole in their nuclei. Their masses correlate tightly with the stellar velocity dispersion of the host stellar bulge, as manifested in the M\nBH\u2212\u03c3\u2217 relation of spheroids (Ferrarese & Merritt 2000, Gebhardt et al. 2000). It is not yet understood whether such scaling relations were set in primordial structures and maintained throughout cosmic time with a small dispersion or which physical processes established such correlations in the first place. Nor it is understood whether the energy released during the luminous quasar phase has a global impact on the host, generating large-scale galactic outflows and quenching star formation (Di Matteo et al. 2005), or just modifies gas dynamics in the galactic nucleus (Debuhr et al. 2010).", "Here, we consider a different perspective on the link between the assembly of the stellar component of galaxies and the growth of their central black holes.

However, several authors have discussed the need for luminosity-dependent bolometric corrections, which in turn can affect the derived accretion history (e.g., Marconi et al. 2004, Hopkins et al. 2007, Shankar et al. 2009). Moreover, although the hard X-ray LF includes unobscured as well as moderately obscured sources that may not be identified as AGN at optical wavelengths, it can miss Compton thick AGN, which may be identified in other ways, particularly using IR data.

Second, the rest-frame UV continuum properties of very high redshift galaxies appear to show little evidence for the \u201cexotic\u201d stellar populations (e.g., extremely subsolar metallicities or top-heavy IMFs) that would significantly boost the LyC photon yield (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013). Although improved knowledge of the SFRD beyond redshift 9 may help to better characterize this photon shortfall, the prospects of a direct observational determination of the escape fraction of ionizing photons leaking into the IGM at these early epochs look rather bleak, as the Universe becomes opaque to LyC radiation above redshift 4.", "The cosmic history of star formation is one of the most fundamental observables in astrophysical cosmology. We have reviewed the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that are allowing astronomers to map the transformation of gas into stars, the production of heavy elements, and the reionization of the Universe from the cosmic dark ages to the present epoch. Under the simple assumption of a universal IMF, there is reasonable agreement between the global SMD inferred at any particular time and the time integral of all the preceding instantaneous star-formation activity, although modest offsets may still point toward systematic uncertainties. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the SFRD peaked \u223c3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang and dropped exponentially at z<1 with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. The Universe was a much more active place in the past: Stars formed at a peak rate approximately nine times higher than is seen today. Approximately 25% of the present-day SMD formed at z>2, before the peak of the SFRD, and another 25% formed since z = 0.7, i.e., roughly over the last half of the Universe's age. From the peak of the SFRD at z\u22482 to the present day, and perhaps earlier as well, most stars formed in galaxies that obey a relatively tight SFR-M\u2217 correlation, and only a small fraction formed in starbursts with significantly elevated specific SFRs. The smooth evolution of this dominant main-sequence galaxy population suggests that the evolution of the cosmic SFH is primarily determined by a balance between gas accretion and feedback processes, both closely related to galaxy mass, and that stochastic events such as merger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role. The growth histories of the stellar component of galaxies and their central black holes are similar in shape, suggesting broad coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to 0.001 solar by redshift six, 1 Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than 10 hydrogen LyC photons per baryon, indicating a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization. The SFRD at z\u22487 was approximately the same as that of today, at z\u22480, but only 1% of today's SMD was formed during the epoch of reionization.", "As far as the observations and data are concerned, there is still room for improvement in both SFRD and SMD measurements at virtually every redshift, from the local Universe to the epoch of reionization (Section 4.6). That said, it would be somewhat surprising if new measurements changed the picture dramatically at z<1; it is more likely that stellar population modeling, e.g., for deriving stellar masses or SFRs, could still change the details of the picture during the decline and fall of the cosmic SFH. Indeed, at all redshifts, limitations of our methods for interpreting light as mass may play a significant, even dominant, role in the error budget for the analyses described in this review. The peak era of cosmic star formation has been extensively mapped, and yet even with the current data (\nFigure 9\n), it is still hard to accurately pinpoint the redshift of maximum SFRD within a range \u0394z=1. Our fitting function (Equation 15) places this peak at z\u22481.85, which is plausible but still uncertain. Uncertainties in the faint-end slope of the IRLF and in extinction corrections for the UVLF still dominate at this peak era of cosmic star formation. Although evidence seems to point clearly to a steady increase in the SFRD from z = 8 to z\u22482, our direct knowledge of dust-obscured star formation at these redshifts is, for the most part, limited to the rarest and most ultraluminous galaxies, leaving considerable uncertainty about how much SFRD we may be missing in the UV census of that early phase of galaxy evolution. At z>4, our galaxy surveys have been strongly biased toward UV-bright galaxies and may underestimate both SFRDs and SMDs. Even for UV-selected galaxies, the measurements at z\u2a7e8 are very new and likely uncertain, unsupported by spectroscopic confirmation to date. In addition to measuring redshifts, spectroscopy from the JWST will help clarify basic issues about nebular line emission and the degree to which it has affected the photometric analyses that have been carried out to date.", "Painstaking though all this vast effort has been, it does miss a crucial point. It says little about the inner workings of galaxies, i.e., their \u201cmetabolism\u201d and the basic process of ingestion (gas infall and cooling), digestion (star formation), and excretion (outflows). Ultimately, it also says little about the mapping from dark matter halos to their baryonic components. Its roots are in optical-IR astronomy, statistics, stellar populations, and phenomenology, rather than in the physics of the ISM, self-regulated accretion and star formation, stellar feedback, and SN-driven galactic winds. It provides a benchmark against which to compare semianalytic modeling and hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, but it offers little guidance in identifying the smaller-scale basic mechanisms that determine the rate of conversion of gas into stars and lead to the grandiose events in the history of the Universe described in this review.", "A variety of physical processes are thought to shape the observed distribution of galaxy properties, ranging from those responsible for galaxy growth (e.g., star formation and galaxy merging) to those that regulate such growth (e.g., energetic feedback from SNe, AGN, and the UV radiation background). However, many of these processes likely depend primarily on the mass of a galaxy's dark matter halo. Relating the stellar masses and SFRs of galaxies to the masses and assembly histories of their parent halos is a crucial piece of the galaxy formation and evolution puzzle. With the accumulation of data from large surveys and from cosmological numerical simulations, several statistical methods have been developed over the past decade to link the properties of galaxies to the underlying dark matter structures (e.g., Berlind & Weinberg 2002, Yang et al. 2003, Vale & Ostriker 2004). One of them, the \u201cabundance matching\u201d technique, assumes in its simplest form a unique and monotonic relation between galaxy light and halo mass, and it reproduces galaxy clustering as a function of luminosity over a wide range in redshift (e.g., Conroy et al. 2006, Guo et al. 2010, Moster et al. 2010). Modern versions of this approach (Behroozi et al. 2013, Moster et al. 2013) have shown that (a) halos of mass \u223c1012M\u2299 are the most efficient at forming stars at every epoch, with baryon conversion efficiencies of 20\u201340% that fall rapidly at both higher and lower masses; (b) in halos similar to that of the Milky Way, approximately half of the central stellar mass is assembled after redshift 0.7; and (c) in low-mass halos, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, whereas in massive halos more than half of the central stellar mass is formed \u201cex situ.\u201d These studies represent promising advances, albeit with serious potential shortcomings (e.g., Guo & White 2013, Zentner et al. 2013). The assumption of a monotonic relation between stellar mass and the mass of the host halo is likely incorrect in detail, and it predicts only numerically converged properties on scales that are well resolved in simulations. The matching procedure requires minimal assumptions and avoids an explicit treatment of the physics of galaxy formation. As such, it provides relatively little new insight into this physics. In the version of this technique by Behroozi et al. (2013), for example, the cosmic SFH is reproduced by construction.", "As of this writing, a solid interpretation of the cosmic SFH from first principles is still missing (for a recent review, see Mac Low 2013). Generically, one expects that star formation may be limited at early times by the build-up of dark matter halos and quenched at low redshift as densities decline from Hubble expansion to the point where gas cooling is inhibited. These two regimes could then lead to a peak in the SFH at intermediate redshifts (Hernquist & Springel 2003). A decade ago, hydrodynamical simulations predicted that the peak in star-formation activity should occur at a much higher redshift, z\u22735, than is actually observed (Springel & Hernquist 2003, Nagamine et al. 2004). Theoretical modeling has been unable to correctly forecast the evolution of the SFRD because of the large range of galaxy masses that contribute significantly to cosmic star formation and the difficulty in following the feedback of energy into the ISM and circumgalactic medium from stellar radiation, SN explosions, and accreting massive black holes. Gas cooling in an expanding Universe is an intrinsically unstable process because cooling acts to increase the density of the gas, which in turn increases the cooling rate. Systems collapsing at low redshift have low mean densities and long cooling times, whereas systems collapsing at higher redshifts have higher mean densities and cool catastrophically. Without feedback processes that transfer energy to the ISM and reheat it, one is faced with the classical overcooling problem\u2014the unphysical cooling of hot gas in the poorly resolved inner regions of galaxies\u2014and with the consequent overproduction of stars at early times. And yet, a completely satisfactory treatment of feedback in hydrodynamical simulations that capture large cosmological volumes remains elusive, as these mechanisms operate on scales too small to be resolved and must therefore be incorporated via ad hoc recipes that are too simplistic to capture the complex subgrid physics involved (e.g., Schaye et al. 2009).", "In-depth knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for suppressing star formation in small halos (e.g., Governato et al. 2010, Krumholz & Dekel 2012, Kuhlen et al. 2012), more powerful supercomputers, better algorithms, as well as more robust numerical implementations of stellar feedback (e.g., Agertz et al. 2013) all now appear as crucial prerequisites for predicting more realistic SFHs. Newer and deeper observations from the ground and space should improve our measurements of the galaxy population and its integrated properties, especially at and beyond the current redshift frontier where data remain sparse.

Before these data were published as M\u00fcnch & Zirin (1961), M\u00fcnch showed them to Lyman Spitzer, who interpreted the lines as evidence for diffuse, extraplanar hot gas (T\u223c106 K), which keeps the colder clouds traced by Nai and Caii in pressure confinement (Spitzer 1956). Thus was born the idea of the Galactic corona and its exploration by absorption lines in the spectra of background objects. Following Schmidt's 1963 discovery of quasars, studies of extragalactic gas rapidly progressed with spectroscopy of the intervening absorption lines by J. Bahcall, M. Burbidge, J. Greenstein, W. Sargent, and others. Bahcall & Spitzer (1969, p. L63) then proposed that \u201cmost of the absorption lines observed in quasi-stellar sources with multiple absorption redshifts are caused by gas in extended halos of normal galaxies.\u201d In the 1980s, subsets of the quasi-stellar object (QSO) absorption lines were associated with galaxies (Bergeron 1986, Bergeron & Boiss\u00e9 1991), whereas the Lyman alpha forest emerged as their intergalactic medium (IGM) counterpart (Sargent et al. 1980). Spurred by these developments, the Hubble Space Telescope and the Keck Observatory made great leaps in the 1990s toward a broader characterization of the number density and column density distribution of the IGM and circumgalactic medium (CGM) back to z\u223c3. Pioneering studies from Hubble\u2019s Key Project on QSO absorption lines demonstrated that galaxy halos give rise to strong Ly\u03b1, Civ, and other metal lines (e.g., Lanzetta et al. 1995, Chen et al. 1998) in a gaseous medium that is richly structured in density, temperature, and ionization (\nFigure 1\n).\n", "", "\n Figure 1\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "In the 2000s, large galaxy surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) uncovered the galactic baryon deficit, the mass metallicity relation, and quenching problems (Section 2). Meanwhile, theorists implemented new physical prescriptions for gas accretion and feedback with new numerical methods and faster computers. It soon became impossible even to address these big mysteries of galaxies without appealing to gas flows between the interstellar medium (ISM), the IGM, and by implication, the CGM. Yet most such models of gas flows were, and are still, tested against observations of starlight\u2014the same observations that first posed the problems. By the mid-2000s, models and observations of gas flows in and out of galaxies had reached the point that the former were in urgent need of direct observations of the gas flows themselves. CGM studies leaped forward in the late 2000s with the installation of Hubble\u2019s Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, which was designed for reaching diffuse gas with 30\u00d7 the sensitivity of its predecessors, and with new techniques for stacking and combining X-ray and optical spectra. This is the context in which we write our review.

Why do dark matter halos of different masses give rise to galaxies with drastically different star-formation and chemical histories (Sections 2.1.1 and 2.1.2)? Why does such a small fraction of cosmic baryons and metals reside in the galaxies (Sections 2.1.3 and 2.1.4)? The prevailing answers to these questions all feature the regulation of gas flows into and out of galaxies\u2014which necessarily pass into and through the CGM.

More generally, sub-L\\* galaxies generally have extended bursty star-formation histories, as opposed to the more continuous star formation found in more massive galaxies, suggesting differences in how and when these galaxies acquire their star-forming fuel. As this fuel is from the CGM, we must explain how sub-L\\* and L\\* galaxies fuel star formation for longer than their \u03c4dep.", "How galaxies become and remain passive is one of the largest unsolved problems in galaxy evolution (\nFigure 2b\n\n). Proposed solutions to this problem involve controlling the gas supply, either by shutting off IGM accretion or keeping the CGM hot enough that it cannot cool and enter the ISM. Low-mass galaxies tend to continue forming stars unless they are a satellite of or near a more massive galaxy (Geha et al. 2012). This finding suggests that the central galaxy's gaseous halo strips the satellite with ram pressure or \u201cstarves\u201d the satellite of fresh fuel. These ideas have specific testable implications for the physical state of the CGM.", "The \u039bCDM model predicts that baryons follow gravitationally dominant dark matter into halos, where the gas dissipates energy as radiation and cools into the center of the halo. Observed galaxies, however, harbor only a small share of the halo's expected baryons in their stars and ISM, with M\nb\u226a(\u03a9b/\u03a9m)M\nh (\nFigure 2c\n\n). Even at their most \u201cefficient,\u201d L\\* galaxies have converted only \u223c20% of their halos\u2019 baryons into stars (\nFigure 2\nc\n\n\n), with values of only about 5\u201310% in sub-L\\* and super-L\\* galaxies (Behroozi et al. 2010, McGaugh et al. 2010). There are three basic possibilities: The baryons are in the halo but not yet detected, such as hot or diffuse gas; the baryons have been accreted and then ejected from the halo altogether; or the baryons have been prevented from accreting into the halo in the first place. Although reality probably combines aspects of all three, in any combination they strongly suggest that the CGM is an excellent place to look for missing halo baryons in cold or hot gas or to look for direct evidence of past ejection.", "Although baryons come from outside the halo, metals are sourced locally by stars and the deaths of stars. Star-forming galaxies over \u223c3 decades in stellar mass retain a surprisingly flat \u223c20\u201325% of the metals they have ever produced (Peeples et al. 2014) in their stars, ISM gas, and dust. Metals have clearly been lost to outflows (Tremonti et al. 2004), but how these outflows scale with galaxy mass is unclear. Models that already struggle to reproduce the observed steep mass\u2013metallicity relation (Somerville & Dav\u00e9 2015) fail to retain the low, flat fraction of metals produced (e.g., Zahid et al. 2012, Muratov et al. 2015, Oppenheimer et al. 2016). Although \u201cmissing baryons\u201d concern accretion and feedback through the outer boundary of the CGM, metals address the disk/halo interface: Do they leave the halo altogether or recycle back into the galaxy's ISM on long timescales as a \u201chalo fountain\u201d (Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2008)? On what timescales are ejected metals recycled? How metal-enriched is outflowing material relative to the ambient ISM; i.e., what are the entrainment fractions and metal-loading factors? How does dust survive the journey out of galaxies, and what chemical clues does it hide? As we show below, following the metals as \u201cNature's tracer particles\u201d is a fruitful and revealing route to understanding the CGM.", "How galaxies acquire, eject, and recycle their gas are core issues in galaxy evolution, on par with how they evolve in their shapes and how star formation works. To a large extent these gas flows are galaxy evolution. The CGM is a main venue for these flows: It is potentially the galactic fuel tank, waste dump, and recycling center all at the same time. This review approaches the growing body of empirical results and theoretical insights from the direction of these four major questions. For example, rather than asking \u201cWhat are the Mgii absorbers?,\u201d we ask, \u201cWhat do the Mgii absorbers tell us about the mass and kinematics of galactic outflows?\u201d We thus favor physical insights and synthesis of discoveries over detailed discussions of methods, compilations of data, or exhaustive cataloging of the literature. We hope that this approach improves understanding between those who study gas and galaxies (still disparate groups) and those who more effectively highlight open issues to be pursued in the future.", "For the purposes of our discussion, we define the CGM to be bounded at the outside by the virial radius R\nvir of a galaxy's dark matter halo and on the inside by the disk or ISM. Neither boundary is well defined, and precisely defining when gas passes through one of these boundaries can be either a valuable research contribution or a fruitless semantic exercise depending on circumstances. We focus on the phenomenology and physics of gas that fills out halos without too much attention to these exact definitions.", "We now survey the wide range of observational techniques used to probe the CGM. We include diagnostic features from across the electromagnetic spectrum from the X-ray through the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV), far-ultraviolet (FUV), and near-ultraviolet (NUV), and into the optical.", "Viewing the CGM in absorption against a bright background source like a quasar offers three major advantages over other methods: (a) sensitivity to extremely low column density, N\u22431012 cm\u22122; (b) access to a wide range of densities, unlike emission-line measures that scale as density squared; and (c) invariance of detection limits to redshift and the luminosity of the host galaxy. These advantages come at a cost, however: Absorption provides only projected, pencil-beam measures of gas surface density, usually limited to one sightline per galaxy by the rarity of background quasars. Within the local Universe (a few megaparsecs) it is possible to use multiple sightlines (e.g., Lehner et al. 2015, Bowen et al. 2016) and, at higher redshift, multiply lensed images from background quasars (e.g., Rauch & Haehnelt 2011, Rubin et al. 2015) to constrain the sizes of absorbers. In general, however, CGM maps made from absorption-line measurements are a statistical sampling of gas aggregated from many galaxies. With massive optical spectroscopic surveys, samples have grown to hundreds or thousands in low ions like Mgii and Caii (e.g., Zhu & M\u00e9nard 2013b). Quasar/galaxy pairings have now been extended out to z\u223c4 and beyond (Matejek & Simcoe 2012, Turner et al. 2014).", "There are three basic ways of building absorber samples. First, blind surveys select background quasars based on brightness and/or redshift and so are optimal for samples that are unbiased with respect to foreground structure. Ground-based redshift surveys around previously observed quasar sightlines are now a time-honored method for constructing samples of quasar/galaxy pairs (e.g., Chen et al. 1998, Stocke et al. 2006, Rudie et al. 2012). The second, targeted approach chooses background sources because they probe particular foreground structures, such as L\\* galaxies (Tumlinson et al. 2013), sub-L\\* galaxies (Bordoloi et al. 2014b), galaxies with known ISM content (Borthakur et al. 2015), or groups and filaments (Wakker et al. 2015, Tejos et al. 2016), by cross-matching the observable quasar with catalogs of these structures. Finally, maps of absorption in the Milky Way (MW)\u2019s CGM use essentially any quasar (or UV-bright halo stars), sometimes chosen to pass through known halo gas structures and sometimes not. Though most absorption-line work has been in the UV and optical, the Chandra X-ray Observatory and X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission-Newton (XMM-Newton) have been used to search for X-ray gas in individual absorbers, constraining the extent of CGM and IGM hot gas (Nicastro et al. 2005).", "It is useful to distinguish between Hi column density regimes that must be, or can be, treated differently in analysis. Lines up to logN\u224315 can usually be analyzed with equivalent widths or Voigt profile fitting. The value logN\u224315 is high for the Ly\u03b1 forest but low for the CGM [there are, of course, a few exceptions (Tumlinson et al. 2013, Johnson et al. 2014) in which Hi is not seen at <100 kpc even to low limits]. At logN\u224316 saturation becomes a major factor, and robust column densities (as opposed to lower limits) must come from profile fitting or from the higher Lyman series lines if the system is redshifted enough. Systems with logN\u224316 are partial or complete Lyman limit systems (LLSs). If the Lyman limit is covered (z>0.24 for Hubble), the flux decrement at \u03bb=912(1+z) \u00c5 allows a precise measurement of \n\n and improved ionization and metallicity diagnostics. Above \n\n (where \n\n is the Hi column density in cm\u22122), the Lyman limit is totally opaque, the highest Lyman series lines are saturated, and genuine column densities must come from fitting the Ly\u03b1 profile for LLSs and damped Lyman-\u03b1 systems.", "Massive spectroscopic surveys have enabled another novel method for examining halo gas. \u201cStacking\u201d of hundreds or thousands of spectra is a powerful way to extract faint signals from absorption-line data sets. This technique requires catalogs of redshifts, for either foreground galaxies or absorbers, so that the spectra of background objects can be shifted to their rest frames and continuum-normalized and then co-added together. The co-addition beats down statistical noise, enabling measurements of weak absorption at the cost of averaging over individual absorber profiles. When the catalogs of foreground galaxies include properties such as mass, radius, SFR, color, environment, or orientation, the stacks can be performed with subsets of the data to examine the variation of mean profiles with these properties (York et al. 2006, Bordoloi et al. 2011, Zhu & M\u00e9nard 2013a). Stacking experiments that correlate the reddening of quasars with foreground galaxy halos in the SDSS survey have revealed large quantities of dust in the CGM of galaxies (M\u00e9nard et al. 2010, Peek et al. 2015). Stacking techniques can also exploit more numerous, but fainter, sources; for example, Steidel et al. (2010) characterized the CGM of z\u223c3 galaxies by stacking the spectra of background galaxies. Stacking can detect weak signals in the mean properties of gas absorbers but at the cost of averaging out kinematic and ionization structure that may contain significant physical meaning.", "\u201cDown-the-barrel\u201d spectroscopy uses a galaxy's own starlight as a background source for detecting absorption. This method has been a fruitful one for studying galactic inflows and outflows from spectroscopy of star-forming galaxies. This method is commonly used to study inflows and outflows in galaxies out to z\u223c2\u20133 in redshifted FUV, NUV, and optical lines (Martin 2005; Steidel et al. 2010; Bordoloi et al. 2011; Kornei et al. 2012; Rubin et al. 2012, 2014; Heckman et al. 2015; Henry et al. 2015). Down-the-barrel measurements are critical pieces of the CGM puzzle because they directly trace current outflows at galactocentric radii that are inefficiently covered by background sources (because of the R\n2 scaling of foreground cross-section). Although down-the-barrel spectra are key for tracing the accretion and outflows that dominate CGM kinematics, they have the key limitation that the galactocentric radius of any detected absorption is unconstrained\u2014it could be anywhere along the line of sight\u2014complicating mass and covering fraction estimates inferred from these spectra.", "Emission-line observations search for photons emitted directly from CGM gas. As the emission measure scales as n\n2, and the CGM has n\nH\u223c10\u22122 or less, finding these photons is a stiff challenge. The MW halo has been extensively mapped for high-velocity clouds (HVCs) and other halo structures using radio emission at 21 cm. This technique has been applied to external galaxies (Putman et al. 2012), but detections are limited to within \u223c10\u201320 kpc of the targeted galaxies. The soft X-ray band is optimal for gas at \u22731 MK. The extremely low surface brightness of the gas makes these observations challenging and expensive, but a few individual halos have been detected and their hot gas budgets measured by Chandra and/or R\u00f6ntgensatellit (e.g., Humphrey et al. 2011, Anderson et al. 2016). Stacking-of-individual-galaxies techniques has also yielded mass density profiles for hot gas around nearby galaxies (Anderson et al. 2013). When combined with halo size, density, and metallicity constraints from soft X-ray absorption-line techniques, these maps have aided in the assessment of the total mass and baryon fraction of the hot CGM.", "Emission-line maps are also possible at UV/optical wavelengths, though they are no less challenging than in the X-ray band. Recent reports claim a detection of an extended Ovi halo (R\u223c20 kpc) around a low-redshift starburst galaxy (Hayes et al. 2016). Extended Ly\u03b1 emission has been seen out to \u223c100 kpc away from z\u223c2.5 galaxies and QSOs (Cantalupo et al. 2014, Prescott et al. 2015). In another case, an extended filamentary structure connected to a galactic disk was detected using diffuse emission in the optical band (Martin et al. 2015). Emission maps can constrain the density profile, morphology, and physical extent of the gas more directly than aggregated pencil-beam sightlines (Corlies & Schiminovich 2016). For X-ray emission from fully ionized gas, masses can be inferred more directly, avoiding the uncertain ionization corrections that plague absorption-line measurements (Section 4); indeed, the CGM's more massive cousin, galaxy clusters\u2019 intracluster medium, has been studied in detail via X-ray emission for decades (Vikhlinin et al. 2006). On the downside, emission-line maps are still challenging technically; the surface brightnesses are extremely small compared to sky and detector backgrounds, and surface brightness dimming has a steep increase with redshift. In a recent study using stacks of fiber spectra from SDSS, Zhang et al. (2016) achieved detections of H\u03b1 at 50\u2013100 kpc around low-redshift galaxies, demonstrating that very sensitive limits can be reached on galaxies in the aggregate. These observations remain challenging, but as \u201ctaking a picture\u201d of an astrophysical object remains the ideal, efforts to improve instrument technology and enable emission-line mapping to reach samples of hundreds of galaxies across cosmic time is an important goal.", "Physical models and simulations are essential tools for understanding the CGM. In contrast to observations, they provide for controlled environments in which physical properties, histories, and futures of gas are all known and can be manipulated to tease insights out of the otherwise unmanageable complexity of a multiphase gaseous medium. As reviewed by Somerville et al. (2015), there are many schemes for simulating the development of the cosmic web and galaxies under the influence of dark matter, gravity, and hydrodynamics. The major methods at present are smoothed particle hydrodynamics, such as Gadget (Ford et al. 2013, Oppenheimer et al. 2016), Gasoline (Christensen et al. 2016, Gutcke et al. 2017), and GIZMO (Muratov et al. 2017); adaptive mesh refinement, such as Enzo (Hummels et al. 2013, Corlies & Schiminovich 2016); and moving mesh (Arepo and the Illustris simulation; Suresh et al. 2017). Large-scale cosmological simulations in megaparsec-scale boxes can simulate hundreds of galaxies in their proper \u039bCDM contexts (e.g., Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006, Ford et al. 2014, Vogelsberger et al. 2014). At the opposite end of the scale, very high-resolution simulations focused on the interaction between dense clouds and diffuse halos (e.g., Heitsch & Putman 2009, Armillotta et al. 2016) that can reach scales at much less than a parsec. Spanning these two regimes are the so-called zoom simulations, which resolve enough of the large-scale structure to accurately trace a single galaxy or a subset of galaxies selected out of larger boxes (\nFigure 3\n; Schaye et al. 2015). Even zooms must make assumptions about physics that they do not resolve, using \u201csub-grid\u201d prescriptions to stand in for such complex phenomena as star formation, metal mixing and transport, supernova and AGN feedback, and others. Sub-grid models are parameterized and tuned to yield specific metrics\u2014like the stellar mass function at z=0\u2014and then the properties that emerge\u2014such as SFRs, morphology, quenching, and the CGM\u2014are analyzed and compared with data to constrain the physical prescriptions that went in. We use simulations from a broad range of techniques and groups to look for insights into how the CGM participates in galaxy evolution and to help interpret data.", "We now turn to the density profile, phase structure, and kinematics of the CGM. We first present the data that show the various ionization states and velocity distributions of the CGM absorption (Section 4.1). Next, we describe how the absorption-line measurements may be translated into physical parameters such as density, temperature, and size (in Section 4.2). We then draw lessons from kinematics (Section 4.3) before considering the physical complexities and challenges inherent in the interpretation of these data (Sections 4.4 and 4.5).", "As a matter of empirical inference, the CGM is multiphase in its ionization structure and complex in its dynamics. The ionization structure shown in \nFigure 4\n compiles measurements for six diagnostic ions as a function of impact parameter (a proxy for radius). These data indicate a wide range of density and ionization conditions up to a few 105 K with very little interpretation required. Observationally, multiphase means many of these metal ions spanning an order of magnitude in ionization potential energy are commonly found within the same absorber system occupying a galaxy's halo.

To produce an extended, multiphase CGM, authors have proposed several scenarios, which we categorize as follows: (a) massive inward cooling flows driven by local thermal instabilities (e.g., McCourt et al. 2012); (b) boundary layers between moving cool clouds in a hot atmosphere (e.g., Begelman & Fabian 1990); and (c) the continual shocking and mixing of diffuse halo gas by galactic outflows (e.g., Fielding et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2016). We discuss the applicability of some of these analytic models in Sections 4.4 and 4.5.", "Direct evidence for a hot component (logT\u22736) in the multiphase CGM comes from both diffuse soft X-ray emission (Anderson & Bregman 2010, Anderson et al. 2013) and absorption along QSO sightlines (Williams et al. 2005, Gupta et al. 2012) for the MW and external galaxies. Indirect evidence for a hot phase comes from highly ionized metals that correlate with the low-ionization HVCs (Sembach et al. 2003, Fox et al. 2006, Lehner et al. 2009, Wakker et al. 2012), suggesting boundary layers between a hot medium and the colder HVCs. MW HVCs also show head\u2013tail morphologies indicative of cool clouds moving through a hot medium (e.g., Br\u00fcns et al. 2000). Finally, the multiphase CGM is clearly manifested in hydrodynamic simulations, which exhibit a mixture of cool (104 K) and warm\u2013hot (105.5\u2013106 K) gas within a galaxy virial radius with a density profile that drops with increased distance from the central host galaxy (e.g., Stinson et al. 2012, Ford et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013, Suresh et al. 2017; \nFigure 3\n). For practical purposes we can regard the outer boundary of the CGM to correspond to R\nvir, but there is no empirical reason to believe that any special behavior occurs at that radius; current observations favor trends in column densities that scale with R\nvir but do not change in form at that arbitrary boundary.", "Evidence for kinematic complexity is revealed as the detected ion species breaking into different components with distinct velocities and line widths. Shown in \nFigure 5\n, the various metal ions show significant but varied correspondence in their component structure. The combination of both aligned and misaligned components between ionization states may reflect clouds or streams with density structure or a population of clouds with different ionization states projected together along the line of sight to the same range of observed velocities. Cloud sizes are difficult to constrain in a model-independent way, but multiply lensed images from background quasars (Rauch et al. 2001, Rauch & Haehnelt 2011) prefer 1\u201310-kpc scales. Fitting Voigt profiles to multicomponent absorption yields column density N, a Doppler b parameter, and velocity offset v for each component from the galaxy systemic redshift, as well as the total kinematic spread of gas in a halo (but this fitting is subject to issues caused by finite instrumental resolution).

If it were feasible to obtain precise measurements for every ion of every abundant element, in all velocity components, then the gas flows, metallicity, and baryon budget of the multiphase CGM would be well constrained. However, atomic physics dictates that only a subset of the ionization states of each element lie at accessible wavelengths. Taking oxygen as an example, Oi and Ovi place strong lines in the FUV wavelengths, whereas Oii\u2013Ov lines appear in the EUV wavelengths (400\u2013900 \u00c5). Ovii and Oviii, arising in hot gas, have strong transitions in the soft X-ray (\u223c20 \u00c5) bands.

The two most generic classes of models are photoionization equilibrium (PIE) and collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE). Generally, low and intermediate ions can be accommodated within PIE models, whereas high ions require CIE models. Species at intermediate ionization potentials, such as Civ and Ovi, sometimes show a preference for one or the other or have contributions from both. These two classes of model are not mutually exclusive: A gas that is collisionally ionized may have the ion ratios further affected by incident radiation, and there are numerous possible departures from equilibrium that further complicate modeling (e.g., Gnat & Sternberg 2007). Generally, having access to more metal ion tracers means one is able to place more refined constraints on the models, whereas results from models with fewer ions are more model dependent.", "Radiative transfer models like Cloudy (Ferland et al. 2013) are used to build PIE models (e.g., Bergeron & Stasi\u0144ska 1986, Prochaska et al. 2004, Lehnert et al. 2013, Werk et al. 2014, Turner et al. 2015). These models are parameterized by density n\nH, or equivalently the ionization parameter logU\u2261\u03a6/n\nH\nc, the observed neutral gas column density N\nHI, and a gas-phase metallicity, log [Z/H]. Here, \u03a6 is the number of photons at the Lyman edge (i.e., the number of ionizing photons), set by the assumed incident radiation field with a given flux of ionizing photons. Besides ionization and thermal equilibrium, another major underlying assumption of photoionization modeling is that the included metal ions arise from a single gas phase with the same origin (i.e., are cospatial). The single cloud, single density approximation for PIE modeling of low ions leads to uncertain cloud sizes, determined by N\nH/n\nH ranging from 0.1 to 100 kpc (Stocke et al. 2013, Werk et al. 2014). In response, some models have begun to explore internal cloud density structure (Stern et al. 2016) or local sources of radiation (e.g., star formation in the galaxy, the hot ISM; Fox et al. 2005, Werk et al. 2016). PIE models generally fail for highly ionized metal species like Ovi, sometimes Civ, and certainly for X-ray ions. For those we turn to CIE, where temperature controls the ionization fractions and a metallicity must be assumed or constrained to derive total hydrogen column n\nH.", "Beyond PIE and CIE, there are nonequilibrium ionization mechanisms that may reproduce the intermediate- and high-ion states that generally fail for PIE (e.g., Civ, Nv, Ovi). These models include: (a) radiative cooling flows that introduce gas dynamics and self-photoionization to CIE models (Edgar & Chevalier 1986, Benjamin 1994, Wakker et al. 2012); (b) turbulent mixing layers, in which cool clouds develop skins of warm gas in Kelvin\u2013Helmholtz instabilities (Begelman & Fabian 1990, Slavin et al. 1993, Kwak & Shelton 2010); (c) conductive interfaces, in which cool clouds evaporate and hot gas condenses in the surface layer where electron collisions transport heat across the boundary (Gnat et al. 2010, Armillotta et al. 2016); and (d) ionized gas behind radiative shocks, perhaps produced by strong galactic winds (Dopita & Sutherland 1996, Heckman et al. 2002, Allen et al. 2008, Gnat & Sternberg 2009). These models all modify the column density ratios given by pure CIE but do not change the basic conclusion that gas bearing these ionic species must be highly ionized, i.e., with a neutral fraction \u226a1%. These large and unavoidable ionization corrections, when applied to Hi column densities of logN\nHI\u223c15\u201318, entail surface densities and total masses that are significant for the galactic budgets (Section 5). It is likely that combinations of PIE and CIE into these more complex models are more accurate descriptions of Nature than either basic process considered in isolation.", "Line widths, given by the Doppler b parameter, illuminate the CGM temperature structure and gas dynamics. The gas temperature, T, and any internal nonthermal motions are captured in the following parameterization: b\n2=(2kT/mi\n)+b\n2\nnt, for a species with atomic mass mi\n. When the low and high ions are assessed via Voigt profile fitting, the low ions are usually consistent with gas temperatures <105 K, with a contribution from nonthermal broadening (<20 km s\u22121; Tumlinson et al. 2013, Churchill et al. 2015, Werk et al. 2016). \u201cBroad Lyman alpha\u201d (b\u2273 100 km s\u22121) and Neviii systems have been detected in QSO spectra at high signal-to-noise ratios that directly probe gas at logT\u223c5.7 (Narayanan et al. 2011, Savage et al. 2011, Tripp et al. 2011, Meiring et al. 2013). These UV absorption surveys indicate that the CGM contains a mixture of photoionized and/or collisionally ionized gas in a low-density medium at 104\u2013105.5 K (e.g., Adelberger et al. 2003, Richter et al. 2004, Fox et al. 2005, Narayanan et al. 2010, Matejek & Simcoe 2012, Stocke et al. 2013, Werk et al. 2013, Lehner et al. 2014, Savage et al. 2014, Turner et al. 2015).", "The velocity dispersion and number of components reveal the kinematic substructure of the CGM. Most significantly, gas near low-z galaxies across the full range of logM\n\u22c6=8.5\u201311.5 show projected line-of-sight velocity spreads that are less than the inferred halo escape velocity, even accounting for velocity projection. Thus most of the detected CGM absorption is consistent with being bound to the host galaxy, with implications for outflows and recycling (Section 7). This is true for all the observed species from Hi (Tumlinson et al. 2013) to Mgii (Bergeron & Boiss\u00e9 1991, Johnson et al. 2015b, Nielsen et al. 2015) to Ovi (Tumlinson et al. 2011, Mathes et al. 2014). The strongest absorption seen in Hi and low ions is heavily concentrated within \u00b1100 km s\u22121. For low ionization gas, internal turbulent/nonthermal motions are b\nnt\u223c20 km s\u22121, whereas for high ionization gas the nonthermal/turbulent contributions to the line widths are 50\u201375 km s\u22121 (Werk et al. 2016, Faerman et al. 2017). Similar total line widths are seen in the z>2 KODIAQ sample, possibly indicating similar physical origins at different epochs (Lehner et al. 2014).", "Misalignments of the high and low ion absorption profiles in velocity space may indicate that the gas phases bearing high and low ions are not co-spatial and thus that the gas is multiphase (e.g., Fox et al. 2013). Some systems, however, show close alignment between low and high ionization gas (Tripp et al. 2011) in a fashion that suggests each detected cloud is itself multiphase, perhaps in a low ion cloud/high ion skin configuration. Heckman et al. (2002) and others (e.g., Grimes et al. 2009, Bordoloi et al. 2016) have argued that the relationship between Ovi column density and absorption-line width for a wide range of physically diverse environments indicates a generic origin of Ovi in collisionally ionized gas. However, the relationship exhibits considerable scatter, is impacted significantly by blending of multiple unresolved components [at least at the moderate R\u223c20, 000 resolution of the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS)], and may arise from other physical scenarios such as turbulent mixing (e.g., Tripp et al. 2008, Lehner et al. 2014). Generally, high ions like Ovi in the CGM exhibit systematically broader line widths than low and intermediate ions (e.g., Werk et al. 2016). Though complex and varied, absorber kinematics may provide important observational constraints on both ionization and hydrodynamic modeling, but new methods of analysis and new statistical tools will be required to realize their full potential.", "Ionization modeling is limited by what might be considered subgrid processes that investigators must cope with to get from line measurements to useful constraints on models. The most basic of these arise in the data themselves. CGM absorption observations are generally not photon-noise limited, but line saturation is a major issue particularly for the most commonly detected species. Only lower limits can be derived from the equivalent widths of saturated lines; line profile fitting helps where the saturation is not too severe. Reliable columns of the crucial Hi ion are often challenging except where the Lyman limit is available. Moreover, the blending of narrow components with small velocity offsets in data with finite spatial resolution make all line measurements somewhat ambiguous. It is often necessary to model an entire line profile as a single nominal cloud, though sometimes the ionization state can be constrained on a component-by-component basis.", "There is often ambiguity about whether to adopt PIE, CIE, or combination nonequilibrium models. These issues are compounded by uncertainties in the additional model inputs. These include the relative elemental abundances, which need not be solar but are usually assumed to be. The extragalactic ultraviolet background (EUVB) is a particular problem as it may be uncertain especially at low redshift (Kollmeier et al. 2014), introducing up to an order of magnitude systematic error into some ionic abundances (Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013a).", "Though Ovi is among the strongest and most frequently detected CGM metal absorption lines, it amply demonstrates the problems encountered in precisely constraining the exact physical origins of ionized gas. For example, absorption-line studies in high-resolution and high-S/N QSO spectra and complementary studies of HVCs around the MW show that the ionization mechanisms of Ovi are both varied and complex over a wide range of environments (e.g., Sembach et al. 2004, Tripp et al. 2008, Savage et al. 2014). Ionic column density ratios and line profiles sometimes support a common photoionized origin for Ovi, Nv, and low-ion gas (e.g., Muzahid et al. 2015), whereas other systems require Ovi to be collisionally ionized in a \u223c105.5-K plasma (e.g., Tumlinson et al. 2005, Fox et al. 2009, Narayanan et al. 2011, Tripp et al. 2011, Wakker et al. 2012, Meiring et al. 2013, Turner et al. 2016). Often, the multiple components for a single absorber show both narrow and broad absorption lines consistent with both scenarios.", "All these thorny issues with ionization modeling highlight the difficulty of getting at the detailed subgrid physics of a complex, dynamic, ionized medium. We should maintain a cautious posture toward conclusions that depend sensitively on exact ionization states. Much of the detailed physics is still at scales that we cannot yet resolve. Nevertheless, in Section 5, we see what we can learn by simplifying the situation to the most basic classes of models and proceeding from there.", "The Galactic Corona began with Spitzer's insight that cold clouds could be confined by a hot surrounding medium. This model has matured over the years into a strong line of theoretical research focused on the detailed physics of how the thermal, hydrodynamic, and ionization states of CGM gas evolve in dark matter halos. Placing multiphase gas into the context of the dark matter halo, Maller & Bullock (2004) suggested cold clouds cooled out of thermal instabilities in a hot medium while maintaining rough pressure equilibrium [though see Binney et al. (2009) for a counterpoint]. Accretion may also be seeded by gas ejected from the disk, as in the galactic fountain or precipitation model (e.g., Fraternali & Binney 2008, Voit et al. 2015b). These scenarios start with very simple assumptions\u2014such as hydrostatic hot halos, diffuse clouds in PIE, or particular radial entropy profiles. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because we do not know the large-scale physical state of the CGM as a whole. Photoionization modeling of the low-ionization CGM using only the EUVB (Haardt & Madau 2001) strongly disfavors hydrostatic equilibrium with hot gas at T\nvir (Werk et al. 2014); the cool and hot phases appear to have similar densities, rather than similar pressures. Furthermore, if Ovi-traced gas follows a hydrostatic profile at the temperature where its ionization fraction peaks, T \u223c105.5 K, then its column density profile would be significantly steeper than observed (Tumlinson et al. 2011). There may be other means of supporting this gas, such as turbulence (Fielding et al. 2017), cosmic rays (Salem et al. 2016), or magnetic fields.", "Adding to the uncertain physical conditions in the CGM is that Ovi likely represents a massive reservoir of warm gas (Section 5.2.3). Such a massive reservoir is apparently at odds with the short cooling times for Ovi given by typical CIE models; these timescales are often much shorter than the dynamical time, on the order of \u2272108 year. Yet, the short cooling times for Ovi are in fact characteristic of many models for the multiphase CGM. In many formulations, the cooler low-ion-traced gas precipitates out of the warmer Ovi-traced phase, owing to thermal instabilities (Shapiro & Field 1976, McCourt et al. 2012, Voit et al. 2015b, Thompson et al. 2016; see also Wang 1995), whereas the Ovi-traced gas may be continually replenished by a hot galactic outflow. In a similar vein, the Ovi-traced warm gas could be cooling isochorically out of a hotter halo (e.g., Edgar & Chevalier 1986, Faerman et al. 2017) but overcome its short expected lifetime by extra energy injection from star formation or AGN.", "Fully understanding the broader context and origin of the multiphase CGM requires more than what microphysical and phenomenological models alone can offer. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations with self-consistent cosmic accretion and multiphase outflows are key to deciphering the panoply of observed absorption lines (Section 7). Moreover, much of the microphysics proposed as a natural source or maintainer of multiphase gas (e.g., thermal instabilities and turbulence) requires resolutions much higher than can be achieved by simulations that must simultaneously model the enormous dynamic range required for galactic assembly. Yet essentially all cosmological hydrodynamic simulations do produce a multiphase CGM (see, e.g., \nFigure 3\n). In general, the combination of the simulated density and temperature profiles of the CGM results in different ions preferentially residing at different galactocentric radii, with low ions preferring the denser, cooler inner CGM and higher ions filling the lower-density, hotter outer CGM (Hummels et al. 2013, Ford et al. 2014, Suresh et al. 2017; see also Stern et al. 2016). Yet inhomogeneous mixing of the different gas phases complicates predictions for gas cooling rates and the small-scale metal mixing that depend crucially on the unknown diffusion coefficient (Schaye et al. 2007).", "Hydrodynamic simulations may be compared directly with observations via synthetic spectra, potentially helping to disentangle the degeneracy between physical space and observed velocity space. Constructing these synthetic spectra, however, faces many of the same challenges as modeling the ionization states of the observed gas: though the density, temperature, and metallicity of the simulated gas may be known, the EUVB and ionization mechanism must still be assumed in order to calculate ionization states (see, e.g., Hummels et al. 2016). Most simulations rely on the same radiative transfer codes (e.g., Cloudy; Ferland et al. 2013) that observational analyses do, though nonequilibrium chemistry and cooling are being included as computation power increases (Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013b, Silvia 2013). If these assumptions are incorrect, comparisons of derived results (such as masses) rather than observables (such as column densities) may lead to simulations getting the \u201cright answer\u201d for the wrong reasons.", "Empirically constraining the total CGM mass as a function of stellar and/or halo mass is essential to quantifying models of galactic fueling and feedback. Under the condition \u03a9\nb\n/\u03a9\nm\n=0.16 (Planck Collaboration et al. 2013), the total baryonic budget of sub-L\\* to super-L\\* galaxies spans two orders of magnitude, ranging from 1010.3 to 1012.3 M\u2299. Although the stars and ISM for super-L\\* galaxies are similar fractions of the total (\u223c5%), the absolute amount of mass that must be found is around 100\u00d7 larger for sub-L\\* galaxies and 10\u00d7 larger for L\\* galaxies. How much of this 80\u201390% missing mass is in the CGM? We organize this subsection by temperature and review the observations, assumptions, and uncertainties in each calculation, using \nFigures 7\n and \n8\n to synthesize current results. We note that a recent review by Bland-Hawthorn & Gerhard (2016) performed a similar radially varying mass-budget compilation for the MW and its halo and incorporates some of these same results.\n", "", "\n Figure 7\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "\n Figure 8\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The baryon census as presented here relies on the assumption that galaxies fall along well-defined scaling relations of ISM and CGM gas mass as a function of stellar mass and that the scatter in these scaling relations is uncorrelated. We caution that there is tentative evidence that this is not necessarily the case: COS-GASS has shown galaxies with more cold gas in their ISMs have more cold gas in their CGMs (Borthakur et al. 2015). Although the correlation between CGM and ISM exhibits a high degree of scatter, likely from patchiness in the CGM, it exists at >99.5% confidence, and stacked Ly\u03b1 profiles for low and high ISM masses clearly show the effect. The large-scale environment and gaseous interstellar content are difficult to explicitly account for in overall baryon budgets and may account for some of the scatter in the various estimates. For example, Burchett et al. (2016) find that the detection of Civ around galaxies with M\n\u22c6>109.5 M\u2299 drops significantly for galaxies in high-density regions (see also Johnson et al. 2015a). Future work should control for these properties.", "We now synthesize observations from across the electromagnetic spectrum to estimate CGM masses and mass profiles for cold, cool, warm, and hot gas. These results are plotted together in \nFigures 7\n and \n8\n.", "Cold gas tracers consist of neutral and low ions like Hi, Nai, Caii, and dust. This is material that may have cooled from hotter phases that experienced thermal instability or may arise in clouds entrained in multiphase outflows. Putman et al. (2012) estimated the total cold gas mass traced by HVCs in the MW halo to be M=2.6\u00d7107 M\u2299 (including only HVCs detected via 21-cm emission, and excluding the Magellanic Stream system). The Magellanic Stream provides an additional contribution of \u223c3\u00d7108 M\u2299, but it cannot be assumed to be a generic feature of galaxies. Thus, the total contribution from cold gas is M\u2272109 M\u2299 even if the interstellar gas of the Magellanic Clouds is included, making up less than 1% of the missing baryons for an MW-like halo. We further note that though dust masses have been estimated from stacks of reddened background QSOs (M\u00e9nard et al. 2010) and galaxies as standard crayons (Peek et al. 2015), indicating values comparable with the dust in the ISM of these galaxies (see Section 6.3), both ISM and CGM dust are at most only \u223c1% of the missing halo baryons. Finally, using stacked optical spectra from SDSS, Zhu et al. (2013) derived a column density profile for gas bearing Caii H and K around \u223cL\\* galaxies. For the purposes of \nFigure 5\n, we have converted this to a mass density profile, conservatively assuming that the calcium is entirely in Caii and Z=Z\u2299. The total mass for Caii itself is 5,000 M\u2299, and when we scale to Z=Z\u2299, we derive M=2\u00d7108 M\u2299 for the cold component, again \u223c1% or less of the baryon budgets.", "The mass of the cool CGM (\u223c104\u20135 K) is perhaps the best constrained of all the phases at low redshift, owing to the rich set of UV lines in this temperature range. Prior to COS, estimates for this phase were based on single ions with very simple ionization and metallicity corrections to arrive at rough estimates. Prochaska et al. (2011a) estimated M\ncool\u2248 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 for all galaxies from 0.01 L\\* to L\\*, assuming a constant N\nH=1019 cm\u22122 out to 300 kpc. Using a blind sample of Mgii absorbers, Chen et al. (2010) estimated M\ncool\u2248 6 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 for the Mgii-bearing clouds alone. The former estimate simply took a characteristic ionization correction, whereas the latter counted velocity components as clouds and converted from a metal column density to n\nH using a metallicity, because neither study had the multiphase diagnostic line sets that could be used to self-consistently constrain gas density and metallicity. Both L\\* and super-L\\* galaxies have provided the most reliable constraints, mainly because of their relative ease of detection in photometric and spectroscopic surveys at z<0.5 (Chen & Mulchaey 2009, Prochaska et al. 2011a, Werk et al. 2012, Stocke et al. 2013).", "With COS, it became practical to build statistically significant samples of absorbers that cover a broader range of ions. These estimates still rely on photoionization modeling, carried out under the standard assumption that the low ions and Hi trace cool (T<105 K) gas, and the primary source of ionizing radiation is the extragalactic UV background. Using the COS-Halos survey, Werk et al. (2014) addressed the mass density profile and total mass for L\u2248L\\* galaxies with PIE models that derive self-consistent n\nH and z using a range of adjacent ionization states of low-ion absorption lines (primarily Cii, Ciii, Siii, Siiii, Nii, and Niii). The resulting surface density profile appears in \nFigure 7\n and yields M\ncool=6.5\u00d71010 M\u2299 for L\\* galaxies out to R\nvir. Using the same COS-Halos sample with new COS spectra covering the Lyman limit, and taking a nonparametric approach with a robust treatment of uncertainties, Prochaska et al. (2017) recently refined the cool CGM mass estimate to be 9.2 \u00b1 4.3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 out to 160 kpc. Stocke et al. (2013) used a complementary approach to estimate individual cloud sizes and masses, along with their average volume filling factor, for galaxies in three luminosity bins (<0.1L\\*, 0.1\u20131L\\*, and L>L\\*). They find volume filling factors that range from 3% to 5% for their modeled clouds, with length scales (NH/nH) in the range of 0.1\u201330 kpc, totaling logM\ncool=7.8\u20138.3, 9.5\u20139.9, and 10\u201310.4, respectively. Finally, Stern et al. (2016) determine the total mass in the cool (and possibly warm CGM) of 1.3\u00b10.4\u00d71010 M\u2299 for L\\* galaxies given their universal cloud density profile. In this phenomenological model each ion occupies a shell of a given n and T such that the fraction of gas in that particular ionization state is maximized. Thus, this calculation represents a conservative minimum of baryons that must be present. These ranges are shown in \nFigure 8\n.", "For super-L\\* galaxies, Zhu et al. (2014) use stacking techniques to estimate the correlation function between luminous red galaxies with a mean stellar mass of 1011.5 M\u2299 and cool gas traced by Mgii absorption in SDSS data for \u223c850,000 galaxies with 0.4<z<0.75. The cool CGM around massive galaxies calculated in this way appears to completely close the CGM baryon budget for super-L\\* galaxies, at 17% of the total halo mass. The assumptions for metallicity and ionization corrections, however, make it uncertain.", "In \nFigure 6\n, ions like Civ, Nv, Ovi, and Nevii trace the warm CGM at T\u2248105\u22126 K. However, this temperature range in particular is burdened by significant uncertainty in the precise ionization mechanism responsible for its purported ionic tracers (see Section 4.4). If high ions are partially photoionized, Ovi, for example, may trace a non-negligible fraction of T<105 K gas that has already been counted toward the total baryon census in the previous section. For gas traced by Ovi, Werk et al. (2016) point out that typical photoionization models like those used for the low ions have difficulty accounting for the total column of Ovi and column density ratios of Nv/Ovi without the need for path lengths in excess of 100 kpc. However, significant additional ionizing radiation at \u223c100 eV may reduce this requirement.", "In general, CIE models require a very narrow range of temperature to reproduce the Ovi observations, T=105.3\u20135.6 K (Tumlinson et al. 2011, Werk et al. 2016). Furthermore, the kinematics of Ovi relative to the low ions, in particular large b values, seem to naturally support the idea that the Ovi is in a hotter phase (Tripp et al. 2011, Muzahid et al. 2012; see also Tripp et al. 2001, Stern et al. 2016). Tumlinson et al. (2011) found that Ovi traces a warm CGM component that contributes >2\u00d7109 M\u2299 of gas to the L\\* baryon budget. This mass estimate is strictly a lower limit due to the conservative assumptions adopted: (a) solar metallicity; (b) the maximum fraction of oxygen in Ovi allowed by CIE models, 0.2; and (c) the CGM sharply ends at 150 kpc. We adopt logM\nwarm=10.0 in \nFigure 8\n for the COS-Halos galaxies (see also Faerman et al. 2017).", "For sub-L\\* galaxies, Bordoloi et al. (2014b) estimate M\nwarm using Civ. These galaxies are at z<0.1, and the COS spectra do not cover the full range of Lyman series lines and ions available at z>0.1, hindering detailed ionization modeling. COS only covers Ovi at z>0.2, where it is difficult to assemble statistically significant samples of confirmed sub-L\\* galaxies, so an Ovi-based mass estimate for low-mass galaxies is not currently possible. With these caveats in mind, assuming a limiting ionization fraction for Civ, Bordoloi et al. derive logM\nwarm=9.5 if the gas typically has solar metallicity. For gas with lower metallicity, e.g., 0.1 solar, the value is 10 times higher and rather closer to baryonic closure for sub-L\\* galaxies (\nFigure 8\n). We caution that for Civ, detailed photoionization often places Civ with low-ionization state gas rather than with high-ionization state gas (e.g., Narayanan et al. 2011). Thus, the Civ-derived mass for sub-L\\* galaxies is highly uncertain without detections of additional ionization states.", "One of the most surprising results to emerge from Tumlinson et al. (2011) is that Ovi appears to be absent around the non-star-forming, more massive galaxies in the COS-Halos sample. Thus, there is tentative evidence that \u223c105.5 K gas is not a major component of the CGM of super-L\\* galaxies, which may be a result of massive galaxies having generally hotter halos or nonequilibrium cooling (Oppenheimer et al. 2016). Thus, we do not have a good observational constraint for the warm CGM baryonic content for super-L\\* galaxies. The EUV ion Neviii redshifts into the COS band at z>0.5, where a few detections (Tripp et al. 2011, Meiring et al. 2013) hint that it may be present in halos out to 100\u2013200 kpc. However, the number of absorbers associated with particular galaxies is not yet sufficient to include it in mass estimates for the warm phase.", "Hot gas at the virial temperature (T\nvir=GM\nhalo\nm\np/kR\nvir) is a long-standing prediction. For M\nhalo\u22731012 M\u2299, the temperature should be T\u2273106 K, and observable at X-ray wavelengths, although there are EUV tracers such as Mgx and Sixii that have yet to yield positive detections (\nFigure 4\n). Only a few very luminous spirals and ellipticals have had their halos detected (Anderson & Bregman 2011, Dai et al. 2012, Bogd\u00e1n et al. 2013, Walker et al. 2015, Anderson et al. 2016), and independent constraints on the temperature, density, and metallicity profiles from soft X-ray spectroscopy are rarer still. Thus the fraction of baryons residing in the hot phase, and its dependence on stellar and or halo mass, are not yet determined.", "Three sets of constraints are relevant: the MW, individual external galaxies, and stacked samples of external galaxies. Anderson & Bregman (2010) addressed directly the problem of whether hot gas could close the baryon budget for the MW. From indirect constraints such as pulsar dispersion measures toward the Large Magellanic Cloud, cold gas cloud morphology, and the diffuse X-ray background, they limited the hot gas mass to M\u22720.5\u20131.5\u00d71010 M\u2299 or only 2\u20135% of the missing mass. The choice of an NFW profile for the hot gas is a key assumption: If the density profile is assumed to be flatter (\u03b2\u223c0.5), the mass can be 3\u20135 times higher, but still only 6\u201313% of the missing baryons. The claims by Gupta et al. (2012) that the baryon budget is closed for the MW, based on the assumption of an isothermal, uniform density medium, have been questioned by evidence that the gas is neither isothermal nor of uniform density (Wang & Yao 2012).", "The well-studied case of NGC 1961 (Anderson et al. 2016) constrains the hot gas surface density out to R\u224340 kpc, inside which M\nhot=7\u00d7109 M\u2299. This is only 2% of the stellar mass (3\u00d71011 M\u2299) and so leaves the galaxy far from baryonic closure. Extrapolating to 400 kpc yields M\nhot=4\u00d71011 M\u2299, but given the declining temperature profile it is likely that the gas well beyond the X-ray detections is at lower temperatures, T\u2272106 K, where EUV and FUV indicators provide the best diagnostics. Stacked emission maps of nearby galaxies provide the strongest evidence for extended hot halos. In a stack of 2,165 isolated, K-selected galaxies from ROSAT (R\u00f6ntgensatellit), Anderson et al. (2013) found strong evidence for X-ray emission around early-type galaxies and extremely luminous galaxies of both early and late type. The X-ray luminosity depends more on galaxy luminosity than on morphological type. Luminous galaxies show M=4\u00d7109 M\u2299 within 50 kpc, and M=1.5\u20133.3\u00d71010 M\u2299 if extrapolated out to 200 kpc, which is comparable with the stellar masses. Yet high amounts of hot gas this far out would appear to be excluded, as found by Yao et al. (2010), who stacked Chandra spectra at the redshifts of foreground galaxies and placed strict (\u22721 m\u00c5) limits on Ovii and Oviii. The limits are also consistent with the limits on nearby galaxy emissivity, derived earlier by Anderson & Bregman (2010). The key uncertainty is how far out the hot gas extends with the flat, \u03b2\u223c0.5 density profile seen at R\u227250 kpc, but the Yao et al. (2010) limits imply that hot gas halos around nearby galaxies host at most \u22431010 M\u2299. In their summary of the X-ray results, Werk et al. (2014) adopted M\nhot=1\u201314\u00d7109 M\u2299 from Anderson et al. (2013).", "The thermal Sunyaev\u2013Zel'dovich (SZ) effect\u2014scattering of CMB photons by free electrons in a plasma\u2014may constrain the hot gas content of galaxy clusters and halos down to the galactic scale. The Planck Collaboration et al. (2013) and Greco et al. (2015) claim detections down to M\n\u22c6=2\u00d71011 M\u2299 and a possible signal down to M\n\u22c6=6\u00d71010 M\u2299. These results create tension with the X-ray measurements, because the SZ detections imply a self-similar relation between M\nhalo and M\nhot down from the cluster scale (M\nhalo\u223c1014 M\u2299), where we know hot baryons close the budgets, into the galactic range where this is much less clear. It may be that the hot gas extends well beyond the X-ray surface brightness limits at 50 kpc up to the megaparsec scales where the SZ effect is measured. However, if every \u2a7eL\\* halo was filled with T\nvir gas, it would violate constraints from the soft X-ray background (Wu et al. 2001). If halos with M\nhalo\u22721011 M\u2299 depart from self-similarity, it could be the cooling and feedback that prevent halos from reaching their cosmic share of baryons. The kinematic SZ effect\u2014in which photons receive a Doppler shift when scattering from a plasma with bulk motion\u2014may be valid at even lower masses for halo gas measurements (Hill et al. 2016). This work is in its early stages, and we look forward to more progress that complements studies in the UV and X-ray bands.", "From the discussion above and the synthesis in \nFigure 8a\n\n, we see that CGM measurements have added significantly to the baryon budgets for galaxies and may complete those budgets under some assumptions. There has been theoretical progress as well: Hydrodynamical simulations generally agree that the CGM contains a budget of baryons at the same order of magnitude as the stellar masses. In \nFigure 8b\u2013d\n\n, we show there is less quantitative agreement for the temperature partitioning of the CGM as a function of stellar mass, despite these models having approximately the same predictions for the baryonic content of galaxies.", "A promising aspect of this quantitative disagreement is that different physical treatments of energetic and/or kinetic feedback do indeed lead to different total baryon fractions, and in particular they lead to different trends in the fraction by phase. Thus, observations of how CGM gas masses are distributed by phase can favor or disfavor particular physical prescriptions and thus already offer phenomenological tests of models. However, these comparisons additionally show how challenging it will be to perform stringent tests. Even where simulations with radically different physical prescriptions yield opposite trends, at any particular mass they are only different by factors of \u22722 in the fraction of any phase. At present, this range is comparable with the systematic errors remaining in the observational characterization of the phases. Thus any claims that the data favors or disfavors any particular model should be made and interpreted carefully. As discussed in Section 4.5, comparing the models with observations\u2014by using synthetic data and directly comparing observables such as column densities and line kinematics\u2014has the benefit of shifting the myriad assumptions discussed in Section 4.2 onto the simulations.", "Total mass budgets by themselves do not fully reveal the flows that govern galaxy evolution. However, there is a ready means of distinguishing inflows from outflows: Stars produce heavy elements sending passively advecting tracer particles out into the ISM, CGM, and IGM from stellar winds and supernovae. The metal content of galactic flows can help identify their origins and determine their fate, and it can break degeneracies between models matched to the four galaxy problems. The galactic metals census (Section 2) requires that we compute the total budget of available metals produced by the galaxy by z=0. This census was performed by Peeples et al. (2014) by compiling measurements on stars, ISM and CGM gas, and dust. As shown in \nFigure 9\n, the contributions bound in stars, interstellar gas, and interstellar dust\u2014the metals inside galaxies\u2014add up to only consistently 20\u201330% over a factor of \u223c1,000 in stellar mass. (Though the overall level of the fraction of metals retained in galaxies is uncertain, primarily owing to uncertainties in nucleosynthetic yields, the flatness of this relation is fairly robust; see Peeples et al. (2014) for a thorough discussion of the uncertainties in this calculation.) Ideally, this census would be done for each element individually, with the CGM divided into each ionization state of that element, e.g., oxygen (Oppenheimer et al. 2016), but as that is observationally not yet generally feasible, the ionization corrections discussed in earlier sections must instead be done to account for unobservable ionization states. Qualitatively similar results are seen in simulations that have addressed this problem in particular (Muratov et al. 2017). This striking invariance must offer some important clues to the operation of galactic outflows and inflows, with potentially large implications for the processes of galaxy fueling, feedback, and recycling.\n", "", "\n Figure 9\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Even Lyman Spitzer might have recognized that the heavy elements observed in the CGM are in some sense the cause of, and solution to, all our problems. Apart from the (problematic) series of Lyman lines in the rest-frame FUV, virtually all our knowledge of the physical state, mass, kinematics, and evolution of the CGM gas come from lines of C, N, O, Si, Fe, Mg, Ca, and so on, whether they appear in the UV or X-ray bands. Yet, as described in Section 4, these critical diagnostics also present many problems of analysis and interpretation. To work through this, it helps to distinguish between measurements of metal content or metal mass, on one hand, and metallicity on the other. This distinction hinges on whether or not the hydrogen content can be measured, which is notoriously difficult. Measurements of hydrogen suffer severe Hi saturation effects, and juggling both metals and hydrogen compounds the difficulties of ionization corrections. When considering metal mass, we can often tolerate simpler ionization corrections or even direct sums of metal ion surface densities, sidestepping the large ionization corrections for Hi (Section 4.4).", "The COS-Halos survey (Tumlinson et al. 2011) used the Ovi line observed with COS in a way that typifies measurements of metal content rather than metallicity. Their basic empirical finding is that Ovi appears at column densities of \n\n\u201314.5 out to the 150-kpc limits of the survey. Because Ovi does not reach more than 20% of the total oxygen in most ionization conditions, they were able to place a robust lower limit of >107 M\u2299 of total oxygen for star-forming galaxies. As it comes from direct integration of surface densities for a heavy element, does not refer to H, and uses a limiting ionization correction, this estimate avoids some of the trickiest aspects of metallicity measurements and yet has significant implications for the budgets of galactic metals (Peeples et al. 2014). The Ovi traces a high ionization component of the CGM gas; adding lower ionization gas to the budget requires the more complex ionization corrections and assumed relative abundances of oxygen and, e.g., Mg and Si, though it does not require the Hi-dependent metallicity corrections that plague the baryon census. Altogether, 20\u201330% of available metals have been located in the R<150 kpc CGM around \u223cL\\* galaxies.", "By contrast with the measurements of total metal mass, bona fide metallicities require robust measurements of the hydrogen surface density, which entails accurate measurements of \n\n and reliable ionization corrections. For most strong CGM absorbers at z\u22720.2, the Lyman series lines are saturated and do not yield reliable Hi column densities. However, beyond this redshift, and at logN\nHI>16.2, LLSs enable adequately precise (\u00b10.2\u20130.3) measurements of N\nHI, and the ionization corrections are manageable.", "By building a sample of LLSs from high-quality COS sightlines, Lehner et al. (2013) and Wotta et al. (2016) found that the distribution of metals in LLSs clearly exhibits two peaks near 4% solar and 50% solar metallicity (\nFigure 10\na\n\n\n). The metallicities are constrained by detections of low to intermediate ions such as Cii\u2013Civ, Siii\u2013Siiv, Oii\u2013Oiv, and Mgii. This bimodal distribution qualitatively matches with expectations that accretion from the IGM into halos will have low metallicity, whereas accretion of gas previously ejected will have higher metallicity. The relative absence of intermediate values challenges our intuition that gas should naturally mix over time into a continuous distribution and has posed a challenge to simulations (Hafen et al. 2016, etc.). But most of these systems have not yet been identified with galaxies. In contrast to the Lehner bimodality, Prochaska et al. (2017) find a unimodal distribution of metallicities within 160 kpc of L\\* galaxies with a median of \u223c30% solar metallicity. These metallicities derive from tight constraints on N\nHI around L\\* COS-Halos galaxies with well-defined masses and distance to the absorber. The contrast between the absorber-selected Lehner et al. sample and the galaxy-selected COS-Halos sample may indicate that they arise in other selection effects, but it may also indicate variation in CGM metallicity in different subsets of the galaxy population.\n", "", "\n Figure 10\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "By mining the Keck database of high-z QSO absorbers, the KODIAQ (Keck Observatory Database of Ionized Absorption toward Quasars) survey studied a sample of LLSs at z>2 (Lehner et al. 2016). This sample is shown in \nFigure 10a\n\n compared with the expanded low-z sample of Wotta et al. (2016). The z>2 distribution is unimodal and centered at [X/H] \u223c\u22122. A similar result was obtained for two samples of LLSs at still higher redshift, z=3.5\u20134, with unimodal distributions centered at [X/H] \u223c\u22122.5 (Cooper et al. 2015, Glidden et al. 2016). This is near the bottom edge of the low-metallicity peak at z<1, indicating evolution in the average metallicity of high-column CGM over the few gigayear interval. Somehow, the bimodality emerges long after the initial buildup of metals and is noticeable only in the z<1 sample. Note that neither of these samples has specific galaxies attached\u2014both are selected based on Hi alone, and the galaxies will have to be identified later. It is also possible that the column density range used for selection traces different galaxy masses, radii, and total column densities at the different redshifts, and so the apparent evolution does not occur in the same type of physical system (owing to a higher mean cosmic density). Nevertheless, it is now possible to compare the distribution of CGM metallicities over \u223c6\u201310 Gyr of cosmic time.", "In particular, there are ever-increasing samples of z>2 absorbers that do have associated galaxy information, allowing for a more direct comparison with the low-z COS studies (\nFigure 4\n). The Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (Rudie et al. 2012) has engaged in a long campaign to characterize the CGM of star-forming galaxies at z\u223c2.2, going back to pioneering studies of absorption associated with Lyman-break galaxies (Adelberger et al. 2003). These data show ion sets that overlap strongly with the low-z studies. Both Hi and metals (Oiv, Nv, Ciii, Civ, and Ovi) show strong statistical correlations with galaxies out to 100\u2013300 kpc. Using stacking, Steidel et al. (2010) and Turner et al. (2015) examined the relative kinematics of metals and galaxies, finding essentially only outflow kinematics and little sign of inflow; there must be gas flowing in to maintain the observed SFRs, but it may be occurring in thin filaments with low covering fraction.", "These results across redshift can be viewed a different way, by examining the redshift evolution of strong lines that are likely to trace CGM gas. \nFigure 10b\n\n shows the comoving sightline densities of Mgii (W\nrest\u2a7e1 \u00c5) and Civ (W\nrest\u2a7e100 m\u00c5), which follow different trends at z<2. The number density of strong Mgii absorbers rises and then declines again toward z=0. Absorbers above this limit occur within \u223c100 kpc of galaxies (see \nFigure 4\n), so the resemblance of this curve to the cosmic SFR density (Hopkins et al. 2006) suggests that the strong Mgii absorbers are linked to the fueling or feedback of star formation. Indeed, other evidence suggests that we are seeing the rise and decline of galactic superwinds (see Section 7.3). In contrast to the Mgii, strong Civ absorbers continue their march upward at low redshift. This trend in moderate-to-high ionization gas may indicate that ionized gas in occupying the bulk of the CGM volume becomes more common even as strong winds creating Mgii absorbers decline with the cosmic SFR density.", "The ISM is a mixture of gas and dust; this is no less true of the CGM. In a pioneering study, York et al. (2006) stacked a sample of 800 strong Mgii absorbers to find evidence of Small Magellanic Cloud\u2013like dust reddening. M\u00e9nard et al. (2010) added the SDSS photometric galaxy catalogs to this style of analysis and found that the reddening extends over angular scales consistent with distances hundreds of kiloparsecs away from the luminous galaxies (\nFigure 7\n). To tie dust to specific galaxies and precise physical scales, Peek et al. (2015) used passively evolving galaxies from SDSS as standard crayons to examine the reddening imposed by foreground SDSS spectroscopic galaxies. They found a strong reddening effect out to 150 kpc in the bluest bands and a steeper drop past that radius than that in the angular correlations of M\u00e9nard et al. (2010). The correlations with physical radius allow Peek et al. (2015) to further estimate the typical total mass of dust for galaxies between 0.1 and 1L\\* of M\ndust\u22436\u00b12\u00d7107 M\u2299. They found only a weak trend with stellar mass, M\ndust\u221dM\n0.2\n\u22c6, and no discernible trend with the galaxies' specific SFRs. Thus the presence of dust in the CGM out to 100-kpc scales provides unambiguous evidence that the CGM is fed by galactic outflows, accounting for approximately 10% of the metals budget near L\\* (\nFigure 9\n). This degree of reddening can be explained by outflows from normal star-forming galaxies in simulations, provided the dust-to-gas ratio is similar to the Galactic value and the dust survives the trip (Zu et al. 2011). It is not yet clear why the dust properties show so little dependence on galaxy stellar mass, resembling the CGM Hi and low ions more than the CGM high-ionization gas. It might be that the increasing reddening at low redshift indicates a steady buildup of metals in the CGM and a relative lack of recycling into future star formation. Dust observations could also be used to test the physical models of galactic outflows that employ radiation pressure on dust to drag gas out of galaxies (Murray et al. 2005, 2011). Further explorations of CGM dust promise to constrain galactic outflows and recycling in ways that complement studies of gas.", "Recent findings show that the CGM possesses a significant budget of baryons, but how are they feeding galaxies across the spectrum of galaxy masses (\nFigure 2\n)? Accreting gas passes through the CGM on its journey from the IGM to galaxies, where it presumably leaves some observable signatures that we can use to characterize the inflows. The rates of accretion onto galaxies and of outflow out of galaxies are crucial parameters in most models of galaxy evolution (Tinsley 1980). However, there is not agreement about where and how a galaxy's fuel source is regulated. It is often assumed gas inflow from the IGM is balanced by the sum of star formation, gas ejection as outflows, and any net buildup of gas in the ISM (Lilly et al. 2013, Dekel & Mandelker 2014, Somerville & Dav\u00e9 2015). This formulation completely omits the role of the CGM, even at the phenomenological level, but this \u201cbathtub\u201d model appears to nonetheless describe the many broad trends in galaxy scaling relations with redshift (Dekel & Mandelker 2014). These models, though they do not explicitly address the CGM's composition or physical state, nonetheless have specific implications for its content and evolution (e.g., Shattow et al. 2015). Conversely, models that use physical principles to describe the regulation of flows between the CGM and ISM (Voit et al. 2015b) can reproduce the same phenomenological galaxy scaling relations without detailed treatments of star formation inside galaxies. With observations of the CGM and its dynamics, we can potentially assess whether its role in regulating star formation is trivial, as the former models assume, or essential, as the latter models assume. Ideally, CGM observations would not only answer this question but also reveal how it fuels star formation and manages outflows as a function of galaxy mass.", "The observations we have discussed up to this point reveal the CGM (at low z) as a massive gaseous medium with a rich internal kinematic structure that is, in bulk, consistent with being bound to the host galaxies. Yet the degeneracy between kinematics and the physical location of absorbing gas can easily get lost in transverse sightline observations.", "In simulations the CGM can appear to have obvious and well-ordered large-scale structure, with accreting and outflowing gas occupying physically distinct regions such as filaments and biconical outflows (Shen et al. 2012, Corlies & Schiminovich 2016; see also \nFigure 3\n), but at low redshift, circumgalactic gas tends to be more well mixed, with instantaneous velocities having little bearing on the origin or fate of a particular pocket of gas (Ford et al. 2014, Muratov et al. 2015, Christensen et al. 2016), though this is also seen at z=3 (van de Voort et al. 2012). In light of the observational projection effects, and theoretical cautions, we now consider what can be learned from observing inflow and outflow directly in down-the-barrel observations, in which we interpret gas blueshifted relative to the galaxy as outflowing and redshifted gas as inflowing. These observations are better at probing gas in or near the disk-halo interface rather than the proper CGM out in the halo. Considering them in conjunction with CGM findings from transverse sightlines promises insights into the dynamics of the CGM that are not otherwise available.", "Gas accretion is perhaps the most fundamental process in galaxy formation (Fox & Dav\u00e9 2017), as galaxies must acquire gas while feedback is optional. In the prevailing theoretical paradigm, gas flowing into galaxies at \u22721012 M\u2299 should be dynamically and thermally cold, whereas more massive halos receive most of their baryons as hotter (T>105) gas (Dekel & Woo 2003, Kere\u0161 et al. 2005, Dekel & Birnboim 2006, Kere\u0161 & Hernquist 2009, Stewart et al. 2011, though see Nelson et al. 2013). Thus cold, dense, metal-poor CGM gas is often interpreted as direct evidence of accretion. First, cool, dense CGM gas is abundant in the form of LLSs. A large fraction of these are metal poor at all redshifts (Lehner et al. 2013, Glidden et al. 2016, Cooper et al. 2015). Metal-poor LLSs are evident as tracers of accretion in high-resolution simulations (Fumagalli et al. 2011, Hafen et al. 2016). The cool, bound Hi seen in the CGM of z\u223c0.25 galaxies (Tumlinson et al. 2013) should have a short cooling time. Finally, the finding from COS-GASS that there is a correlation between interstellar and circumgalactic Hi (Borthakur et al. 2015) implies a connection between circumgalactic fuel and star-forming fuel. Though sub-L\\* and dwarf galaxies have not yet had their cool CGM masses measured directly, the widespread presence of Ly\u03b1 at similar strength suggests they too possess significant budgets of cold halo gas.", "All this evidence taken together strongly indicates that galaxies possess large reservoirs of CGM gas eligible for accretion. Yet evidence for fuel does not automatically constitute evidence for fueling: bound, cold gas has turned up in halos in which its presence is surprising, such as the CGM of passive galaxies (Thom et al. 2012). The actual fate of this material is unclear: How can we claim the bound cold gas is fueling star-forming galaxies but not the passive galaxies? We therefore seek direct signatures of gas accretion onto galaxies. Yet these signatures are notoriously difficult to observe because incoming material may be metal poor, ionized, and obscured by outflowing material. Once gas is near the disk, proving empirically that it is accreting can be extremely difficult when it is seen in projection and its kinematics are easily confused with disk material.", "The MW itself provides direct and unambiguous evidence for inflow in the form of its blueshifted HVCs and the striking Magellanic Stream. The HVCs arise in many complexes of clouds lying within \u223c10 kpc of the disk and have 100\u2013300 km s\u22121 blueshifted radial velocities that indicate they will reach the disk within 107\u20138 years. Their mass inflow rate falls in the range of 0.1\u20130.5 M\u2299 year\u22121, compared with the 1\u20132 M\u2299 year\u22121 of star formation (Putman et al. 2012). These clouds are all detectable in 21 cm emission, meaning that they occupy the tip of the column density distribution of CGM gas seen around other galaxies. The inflow rate inferred for ionized gas is much larger than that for the classical HVCs, \n\n\u20131.4 M\u2299 year\u22121 (Lehner & Howk 2011), which is more comparable with the MW's SFR. The Magellanic Stream is estimated to contain around 2\u00d7109 M\u2299 of gas in neutral and ionized form (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2007, Tepper-Garc\u00eda et al. 2015), and could provide \u223c5 M\u2299 year\u22121 of gas to the MW disk as it accretes (Fox et al. 2014). Unfortunately, HVCs both above and below the radio-detection threshold are difficult to detect in external galaxies, despite intensive searches (Putman et al. 2012), and satellites like the Magellanic Clouds and their Stream are not very common in L\\* galaxies. So, we cannot generalize this result to mainstream galaxy populations.", "Down-the-barrel spectroscopy provides complementary information on inflows. Using this technique on z\u223c0.5 galaxies with Keck spectroscopy and Hubble imaging, Rubin et al. (2012) detected clear signs of inflow at 80\u2013200 km s\u22121 in star-forming galaxies of logM\n\u22c6/M\u2299= 9.5\u201310.5, inferring mass inflow rates of \n\n\u20133 M\u2299 year\u22121. It seems likely that these estimates significantly undercount inflow, because inflowing (redshifted) gas is often obscured by outflows (blueshifted) or by emission from the galaxy's ISM (this problem is especially noticeable at higher redshift; Steidel et al. 2010). Even if outflow is not present, the profiles are not sensitive to accretion from the lower half of the bimodal LLS metallicity distribution (Lehner et al. 2013), which could make up a large fraction of the available cold CGM gas. Recently, Zheng et al. (2017) reported the detection of enriched, accreting gas at the disk-halo interface of M33 via COS observations of Siiv absorption along several sightlines to bright O stars in the disk. Their kinematic modeling of the observed absorption features implies an accretion rate of 2.9 M\u2299 year\u22121. Although these results provide evidence for accretion of cold, metal-enriched gas directly into galaxy disks, evidence for more metal-poor cold-mode accretion, and for gas entering farther out in the disk (on-ramp; \nFigure 1\n), is still lacking (though see Bouch\u00e9 et al. 2013), as is empirical characterization of how accretion rates vary with galaxy mass.", "By consensus, outflows are an accomplice if not the perpetrator in each of the problems outlined in Section 2. The existence of outflows is not in question: The large share of metals outside galaxies provides incontrovertible evidence for them (Section 6). COS-Halos found widespread Ovi around star-forming galaxies\u2014extended to \u223c300 kpc by Johnson et al. (2015b)\u2014but could not show that this ion becomes more prevalent with SFR. Even so, simulations found that robust outflows were necessary to produce the observed reservoir of metals (e.g., Ford et al. 2013, Hummels et al. 2013, Suresh et al. 2017), such that the high-metal ions provide a significant constraint on the time-integrated effects of outflows even if it does not show the effects of recent or ongoing outflows directly. After that, the important questions concern how they transport baryons, metals, momentum, energy, and angular momentum. There is empirical evidence and strong theoretical suggestions that the physical drivers and properties of galaxy winds\u2014their velocity, mass loading, metal content, and likelihood of escape\u2014depend on galaxy mass, circular velocity (v\ncirc), SFR, and metallicity. Many investigators pursue CGM observations in the hope that they can help to constrain these outflows and how they scale with galaxy properties.", "Direct observational evidence for outflows is readily available at all redshifts [see Veilleux et al. (2005) for a review]. In the nearby Universe, large-scale complex multiphase outflows are seen in starbursts (e.g., M82) and from the MW's central regions (Fox et al. 2015). Down-the-barrel spectroscopy of the Nai D in local starbursts (Martin 2005) found that outflow velocities depend linearly on v\ncirc. Rubin et al. (2012) and Bordoloi et al. (2014a) characterized similar flows using Mgii at z\u223c1. At z>2, where the FUV-band ions used at z\u223c0 appear at visible wavelengths, Steidel et al. (2010) used down-the-barrel spectroscopy to detect nearly ubiquitous outflows in rapidly star-forming Lyman break galaxies, with no clear indications for redshifted inflow. Although these results help constrain the mass loading and covering fraction of outflows, they do not show how far these winds propagate into the CGM. It may be that the bulk of the energy is transported out in the hot gas while the bulk of the mass leaves in the cold phase, but this is still an open question (Strickland & Heckman 2009).", "Absorbers on transverse sightlines can directly constrain the impact of winds on the CGM. Cross-correlations of Mgii absorbers with the orientation of galaxies on the sky at z\u22721, from both samples of individual galaxies (Kacprzak et al. 2012, Mathes et al. 2014) and stacked spectroscopy (Bordoloi et al. 2011, Zhu & M\u00e9nard 2013a), find that the strongest absorbers prefer the semiminor axis of disk galaxies, as expected for biconical outflows emerging from the disk. The preference for the semiminor axis disappears by \u223c60\u201380 kpc, indicating that winds propagate at least that far or merge into the general medium near that radius (e.g., the z=2 example in \nFigure 1\n). Studies of outflow covering fractions at z\u223c1 reinforce a picture of outflows being roughly biconical, with little surface area (\u223c5%) solely dedicated to inflow (Martin et al. 2012, Rubin et al. 2014). Another strong clue about outflows comes from examining the CGM of starburst and post-starburst galaxies. Using an SDSS-selected sample, Heckman & Borthakur (2016) found unusually strong Hi and multiphase ions at 100\u2013200 kpc compared with the COS-Halos and COS-GASS samples of galaxies at lower SFRs. These studies collectively show that SFR is a factor in determining the content of the CGM, perhaps as far out as R\nvir.", "Down-the-barrel measurements tell us that outflows are ubiquitous, and sightline measurements tell us that they reach 100 kpc scales. Together these findings suggest that a large part of the CGM is made of outflows, and to examine one is to illuminate the other. The open questions concern not only the basic scaling of velocity and mass loading with galaxy v\ncirc\u2014which has received much attention\u2014but just as importantly the distribution of outflow temperatures, metallicities, and fate. These cannot (yet) be simulated from first principles but can be constrained by the combination of CGM and down-the-barrel observations. The former constrain the radial extent and the velocity fields of multiphase gas far from the disk, whereas the latter constrain the initial velocities, mass loading, and (possibly) metallicities.", "A recent goal of models and simulations has been to discriminate between winds that are momentum-driven (Murray et al. 2005), which appear to improve the match of simulations to the galaxy mass\u2013metallicity relation (Finlator & Dav\u00e9 2008) and the metal content of the IGM (Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006, 2008), and those that are energy-driven (Murray et al. 2011), which appear to better match the galaxy stellar mass function (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2012) and new COS data (Ford et al. 2016). A momentum-driven outflow has a velocity v\nw\u221dv\n\u22121\ncirc, whereas an energy-driven flow has much faster outflows for low-mass galaxies with v\nw\u221dv\n\u22122\ncirc; with a fiducial wind speed of \u223c100 km s\u22121, an unimpeded flow reaches 100 kpc in only 1 Gyr, i.e., the scales on which metals are seen in the CGM (Section 6). Thus understanding the history of CGM metals and the velocities and mass flow rates of galactic flows go hand in hand. Real winds may depend less on the local potential well and more on the local SFR surface density (Kornei et al. 2012, Heckman et al. 2015). New hydrodynamic simulations of galaxies that resolve the multiphase ISM and explicitly include radiation pressure and thermal pressure (Hopkins et al. 2012) support this picture. Like essentially every other simulation suite on the market, however, models with this feedback scheme have too little Ovi in the CGM while retaining too many metals in stars (Muratov et al. 2015).", "Inflow and outflow are necessary processes in galaxy and CGM evolution; can one become the other by the recycling of outflows into fresh accretion of ejected gas? We have already established that, at least at low redshift, galaxies require a long-term source of fuel and that their CGM gas and metals are massive and bound. Recycling is a natural consequence; this gas should reaccrete onto the galaxy if the cooling time is short. Indeed, the predominance of metal-enriched accretion is supported by essentially all cosmological simulations where the origins of gas joining the ISM has been tracked: Significant fractions of gas accreting onto galaxies has previously been ISM gas\u2014and often through multiple cycles (Ford et al. 2014, Christensen et al. 2016, Muratov et al. 2017), with the majority of star formation at late times being fueled by recycled gas (Oppenheimer et al. 2010). Ford et al. (2014) found 60% of all star formation at z=0 is powered by gas that was in the CGM a billion years before. This idea has the intriguing implication that a substantial fraction of all heavy elements on Earth once cycled through the MW's halo at 100-kpc scales. The timescales are unclear: Christensen et al. (2016) find that half of outflow mass is recycled on a timescale of 1 Gyr with a logarithmic tail, independent of halo mass, whereas Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 (2008) find that t\nrec\u221dM\n\u22121/2\nhalo\u223c109\u00b10.5 years, which is a timescale so short for massive galaxies that it is like not having an outflow at all and so long for dwarfs that it essentially escapes forever.", "Thus the idea of recycling is well motivated, but the details are still murky. Is it a simple process in which gas launched at v<v\nesc encounters hydrodynamic resistance and eventually succumbs to gravity to fall back into the galaxy as part of a large-scale halo fountain? Or is the CGM well mixed but multiphase, with metal-rich gas precipitating out of the hot halo and raining onto the galaxy (Fraternali et al. 2015, Voit et al. 2015a, Thompson et al. 2016)? Here, too, metals can help disentangle the ins and outs. Intriguingly, dense CGM gas (Lehner et al. 2013, Wotta et al. 2016; Section 6.2) is roughly equally divided between gas at a few percent solar (metal-poor IGM accretion) and 40% solar (recycling ejecta?).", "Although gas accreting from the IGM generally has (or is assumed to have) very low metallicity (Lehnert et al. 2013, Cooper et al. 2015, Glidden et al. 2016), cases with metallicity well below the IGM (Ly\u03b1 forest) at the same redshift are rare (Fumagalli et al. 2011, Crighton et al. 2017). That is, pristine cosmic accretion either entrains metal-enriched circumgalactic gas on its way into the galaxy (e.g., Fraternali et al. 2015) or, even at the highest redshifts where accretion is potentially observable, is at least partially comprised by material that has previously been in the ISM; i.e., recycled mode accretion is critical to galaxy evolution even at early cosmic times. Yet most formulations of the bathtub model assume that the accreting gas is pristine [e.g., Lu et al. (2015), though see Dav\u00e9 et al. (2012)]. Entrainment is a commonly invoked phenomenon for galaxy outflows; it refers to the wind fluid sweeping up ambient ISM and mixing it with the fresh supernova ejecta powering the outflow. [It is important to note that the metallicity of the outflowing material is necessarily higher than that of the ambient ISM, contrary to what is assumed in some popular simulation recipes (e.g., Vogelsberger et al. 2014).] Does recycled accretion behave in a similar way but in the opposite direction, with pristine inflows sweeping up metal-polluted CGM material on its way from the IGM to the ISM? Or do galaxy winds preferentially reaccrete, sweeping up more pristine cosmic accretion?", "Taking all this evidence into account, we can see the outlines of an emerging picture of galaxy inflows, at least at low redshift. They arise in the massive reservoir of cold, metal-enriched gas bound to a galaxy's potential well, and enter the disk in HVC-like clouds but also in smooth flows of ionized gas. There may be a metal-poor component that comes more directly from the IGM without spending much time in the CGM or otherwise acquiring metals. All these aspects of the CGM\u2014cold, bound, metal enriched, and accreting\u2014align better with the phenomenon of recycled accretion than the bimodal hot/cold accretion. Recycled accretion arises from the ejection of metal-enriched galactic winds that lack the energy to escape the halo entirely or which encounter the CGM itself and lose energy to radiation from shocks and then eventually cool and re-enter the galaxy. It may be that recycling, rather than accretion and feedback, is the more accurate way of viewing how galaxies acquire their gas.", "Passive and/or quenched galaxies possess little if any cold gas in their ISM, and blaming the CGM merely relocates the problem: How and why do these massive galaxies that once possessed a cold ISM lose and not regain it? Presumably their dark matter halos continue to add mass, but the accompanying gas does not enter the ISM and form stars like it once did. How galaxies achieve this transition is a deep and abiding problem in astrophysics, and the array of possible mechanisms for consuming, removing, and/or heating cold gas are beyond the scope of our review. We address the phenomenon of quenching by considering the CGM as a factor in, and indicator of, the quenching process.", "The accretion of gas into halos, its heating to around T\nvir, and its eventual cooling and entry to the ISM was long the prevailing picture of galaxy fueling. In an important twist on this basic picture, Kere\u0161 et al. (2005) argued that star-forming galaxies are fed by \u201ccold accretion\u201d: the gas never reaches T\nvir but enters a galaxy's disk via streams while remaining below T\u223c105 K. Above logM\n\u22c6/M\u2299\u223c10.3\u201310.5 (or M\nhalo\u223c1012 M\u2299), the dark matter halo has sufficient mass, and the CGM enough pressure, to support a virial shock and suppress the cold mode. The coincidence of this mass with the stellar mass that divides star-forming from passive galaxies (\nFigure 2\n) drew great attention to this scenario (e.g., Dekel & Birnboim 2006), leading to predictions that the halos of passive galaxies should possess little cold gas (Stewart et al. 2011).", "The observational picture belies the clean transition seen in simulations and the stark division of observed star-formation rates. Although COS-Halos did find a dramatic difference in highly ionized Ovi around star-forming and passive galaxies, the latter do not show as strong a deficit of CGM Hi. As shown in \nFigure 11\n, the equivalent widths and covering fractions of Hi do not drop as stellar mass increases across the range logM\n\u22c6\u224310\u201311 (Thom et al. 2012). This is directly contrary to the expectation from, e.g., Stewart et al. (2011) that the covering fraction of strong Hi should drop to nearly zero as galaxies transition to the hot mode of accretion. The inner CGM (<50 kpc), however, is not well covered by these observations (\nFigure 4\n); it is possible that high-pressure hot gas close to the galaxy prevents this cold material from accreting, as some models predict (Schawinski et al. 2014).\n", "", "\n Figure 11\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The presence of cool gas in the halos of massive red galaxies is now well established by Mgii studies. Gauthier et al. (2010) and Bowen & Chelouche (2011) found covering fraction of f\nc=10\u201320% out to 100\u2013200 kpc for >1 \u00c5 absorbers around luminous red galaxies (LRGs). Using a sample of \u223c4,000 foreground galaxies at z=0.5\u20130.9 from the zCOSMOS survey, Bordoloi et al. (2011) found that the Mgii equivalent width for blue galaxies is 8\u201310 times stronger at inner radii (<50 kpc) than for red galaxies, but even red galaxies possess evidence for cold gas. Using a new SDSS-based catalog of Mgii QSO absorbers and LRGs, Zhu et al. (2014) mapped the mean profile out to \u226b1-Mpc scales and argue that the mean profile at this mass scale is even stronger than that found by Bordoloi et al., extending at a detectable level out to 1 Mpc for LRGs. Johnson et al. (2015b) have pointed out that strong Mgii absorbers are usually consistent with being bound to their host halos, meaning that the cold gas is contained with the dynamical influence of the galaxy.", "From a theoretical perspective, the quenching of galaxies is still a significant unsolved problem. Star formation must be curtailed, and later accretion and cooling of gas must be suppressed indefinitely to explain how galaxies remain passive for >6 Gyr (Gallazzi et al. 2008). Theories vary in how they accomplish this: Some models artificially truncate star formation based on halo mass (Somerville & Dav\u00e9 2015), whereas others suppress the star-forming fuel by heating the CGM itself (e.g., Gabor et al. 2010, Gabor & Dav\u00e9 2012). Thus the CGM itself can be the proximate cause of quenching, even if the source of CGM heating is not yet identified. Unfortunately models that manipulate the CGM directly cannot be tested against CGM observations, or at least, they must be modified somehow to recover the cold gas seen in passive galaxy halos.", "By contrast, models that include self-consistent subgrid treatments of feedback, whether thermal (Schaye et al. 2015), mechanical (Choi et al. 2015), or a combination of thermal, mechanical, and radiative (Vogelsberger et al. 2014), can be compared with CGM observations as tests of their success. As an example, the mechanical feedback model implemented by Choi et al. (2015) performed better than the standard (Springel et al. 2005, Di Matteo et al. 2008) thermal feedback model in both suppressing galaxy formation and reducing the surface density of gas in the CGM by factors of 3\u201310 at 10\u2013100 kpc.", "\nSuresh et al. (2017) addressed quenching using the Illustris simulations, which are tuned to the observed M\n\u22c6/M\nhalo and galaxy metallicities but not the CGM. In Illustris, thermal AGN feedback is deposited locally, inside the galaxy, when the supermassive black hole is in its energetic quasar mode. But in the \u223c90% of the time when the supermassive black hole is accreting quiescently, its radio mode feedback is deposited nonlocally as thermal energy over 100-kpc scales. This amounts to direct heating of the CGM, shifting cold gas to intermediate temperatures showing more Ovi and otherwise warm gas to high temperatures showing Ovii and Oviii. The net effect is that the Tumlinson et al. (2011) trend of strong Ovi around star-forming galaxies and weak Ovi around passive galaxies is recovered. The cold CGM is reduced but not completely destroyed. To be consistent, any visible effects of feedback would need to persist even when the AGN is not active, as the COS-Halos galaxies in question are not AGN at the time we observe them. The EAGLE simulations presented by Oppenheimer et al. (2016) show a similar conclusion with models of thermal feedback and nonequilibrium cooling: At higher mass, with more feedback, Ovi is suppressed and the cold gas is depleted but not completely destroyed. These feedback effects force behaviors that generally resemble the data: They suppress star formation to create a red sequence, they force net gas loss from the inner CGM by heating gas that then buoyantly rises, and they shift the balance of gas ionization toward higher temperatures and higher ions.", "Despite these advances, the basic paradox of quenching remains: What happens to the halos of passive galaxies to quench their star formation, keep it quenched, and yet leave cold gas present in their halos? If passive galaxies possess cold gas and are not using it, can we be sure of the (na\u00efvely obvious) conclusion that star-forming galaxies are using the diffuse gas they possess? Moreover, if the bulk of star formation at low z comes from recycled accretion, then to understand both how galaxies get their gas and how galaxies quench, we must understand how both the internal and external fuel supplies are shut off.", "If feedback from AGNs is effective at quenching their star formation and their cold CGM in simulations, it naturally suggests that this effect will be visible in the gaseous halos of galaxies with ongoing AGN activity. Although hard radiation fields of AGNs may leave distinctive ionization signatures in halo gas even long after the AGN fades (Keel et al. 2012, Oppenheimer & Schaye 2013b), studies like COS-Halos with subsamples of passive galaxies have excluded active AGNs for the most part and even so have not seen any apparent signs of AGN effects on the CGM. No published study has systematically examined background QSO/foreground AGN pairs, though there is one such study underway with Hubble/COS (\nhttp://www.stsci.edu/cgi-bin/get-proposal-info?id=13774\n).", "At z>2, the Quasars Probing Quasars program has seen clear evidence that galaxies hosting bright quasars show greatly enhanced gas budgets in Hi and low ions (Prochaska et al. 2014) though less excess in the high ions. This enhancement of neutral and low-ionization gas hints at a larger accretion rate for these robustly star-forming galaxies. AGNs may even yield a net gain of cold gas in the CGM (Faucher-Giguere et al. 2016). The Ly\u03b1 blobs observed at z>2 may be gas accreting on to galaxies, with radiation powered by gravitational infall (Goerdt et al. 2010), though these data may be more consistent with illumination from buried AGNs (Prescott et al. 2015). The higher gas masses only exacerbate the problem of feedback and quenching\u2014there is more gas to be removed, and it is still not clear how that gas is removed or heated and accretion suppressed thereafter. Future work should focus on following such galaxies down through cosmic time as their QSOs fade, star formation is quenched, and the galaxies later evolve passively. Post-AGN and post-starburst galaxies should be examined for CGM gas as much as is practical. Understanding this process is critical to properly understanding the role of the CGM in creating or reflecting the birth of the red sequence. Refer to the sidebar titled Some Questions and Directions for Future Work for a summary of what we need to know about the red sequence.", "\n", "\nData in Need of More Theory\n", "1. Are there any clean observational tests or theoretical discriminants between the various heuristic models of feedback?", "2.

Does cool, neutral gas extend into the inner CGM of passive galaxies?", "4. Where are the metals that are still missing from the census? What are the elemental abundance ratios in CGM gas, and how do they depend on the galaxy's mass and star-formation history?", "", "New instruments and new thinking reveal the CGM as a complex, dynamic gaseous environment that may close galactic baryon budgets and regulate gas accretion, star formation, and chemical enrichment. The observational studies that underlie the mass density profiles in \nFigure 7\n and mass budgets in Sections 4 and 5 have all been obtained since 2010. For years, questions about how and when gaseous halos influenced galaxy evolution consistently struggled with what was there. The bulk contents of the CGM are now better characterized than ever before. There remain missing pieces\u2014the baryon and metals budget well below L\\* must still be determined (\nFigure 8\n), and many of the metals are missing\u2014but we can already see signs that the most urgent questions motivating new studies take what and where as known and go on to ask how and when. These sorts of questions strike more directly at physics than at phenomenology.", "How a gaseous halo evolves is determined at any instant primarily by its density, temperature, metallicity, and radiation fields. But for an actual CGM (such as the one simulated in \nFigure 6\n), these physical quantities vary and evolve on many relevant scales, ranging from the subparsec sizes for single cold clouds to the more than 100-kpc size of the whole CGM and even more than megaparsec scales in the IGM. If we are to answer the hows of accretion, feedback, recycling, and quenching, we must achieve a better understanding of the basic physical fields at higher spatial and kinematic resolution. This means finding ways to capture subparsec boundary layers and instabilities while also maintaining the much-greater-than-kiloparsec context. Yet this 5\u20136 order-of-magnitude range still cannot be captured simultaneously in numerical simulations. One approach would be to continue the development of physically rigorous analytic models (e.g., Voit et al. 2015b, Fielding et al. 2017, Thompson et al. 2016, Faerman et al. 2017) that can isolate the key physical effects and then to incorporate these lessons into simulations at the subgrid level while their resolution improves with computing power. For instance, it might be possible to include subgrid models that account for unresolved interfaces between hot and cold gas or to extract subgrid models for cosmological boxes from extremely high-resolution idealized cloud simulations with carefully controlled physics. To complete the leap between phenomenology and physics, these intrinsically subgrid processes must come under control while the proper cosmological and galactic context is maintained.", "The transport of metals and the information they provide would also benefit from addressing the scale problem. Metals trace feedback and drive cooling, so how they are distributed through CGM gas at small scales is a critical factor in a proper physical understanding of accretion and feedback. Dense CGM gas appears to be bimodal in metallicity, congruent with the ideas of pristine accretion and recycled winds. What does this tell us about the small-scale structure of the CGM, the relationship between accretion and feedback, and the mixing of diffuse gas? These are among the thorniest of open questions, because of the huge dynamic range in metallicity that must be captured. This problem will be addressed by larger absorber and galaxy surveys but perhaps poses its stiffest challenges to numerical simulations, because many of the relevant physical mechanisms for mixing gas at boundaries and interfaces are still well below the subgrid level of simulations. This is another case in which coupling small-scale simulations of clouds to cosmological boxes could pay dividends.", "The scale problem exists also for data but might be better labeled a problem of resolution and confusion. In data, the rich multiphase and multiscale structures of CGM gas are seen through a complex rendering in absorption or emission lines from diagnostic ions. The line profiles of absorbers likely contain more information than we are currently able to extract and interpret. Systematic effects from line saturation, uncertain ionization and radiation fields, relative abundances, limited signal-to-noise ratios, and finite spectral resolution all complicate the derivation of the true CGM density field, which in turn enters into mass estimates, energy balance, and timescales for the gas flows of interest. Although we are learning to model and simulate the CGM at higher resolution with better physics, we should also aim to extract and use the full information available in the rich kinematic profiles of multiphase absorbers, which will likely require new analytic and statistical techniques. The importance and complexity of the CGM make it imperative to examine all of the information that Nature provides.", "The CGM matters to galaxies as long as it provides them with fuel and recycles their feedback. Ultimately, this is what we care about most\u2014how does the CGM influence galaxy evolution? The most fundamental questions with which we began are still not completely answered: How does cold gas accrete and form stars over billions of years, and why does this cycle stop in massive galaxies? Does the CGM empty out or get consumed when galaxies quench? How much star formation is fueled by recycling and how much by new accretion? Can we ever hope to identify particular absorbers as accretion, feedback, or recycling, or are we destined never to separate them? These questions will drive the field as it advances from phenomenology toward more sophisticated physical understanding. Properly explaining these phenomena in terms of the hows of accretion, feedback, recycling, and quenching requires that we follow mass flows, not merely mass budgets.", "Now that we have a grip on the bulk contents of the CGM, it is time to develop and deploy the tools to probe these questions of how the gas flows operate. To follow flows, we must make at least three key advances. First, the mass budgets should be characterized more fully in all phases at stages of galaxy evolution, including those that are relatively short lived such as mergers and AGNs. These analyses would additionally benefit from analyzing how outflows and inflows seen in down-the-barrel measurements relate to the kinematics viewed on transverse sightlines, an overdue synthesis deserving attention from both observations and theory. Second, we must attempt to directly constrain the timescales of CGM evolution using data alone\u2014how do mass budgets and kinematics jointly constrain timescales? Third, we must look at simulations in a new way that focuses on the origins and evolution of the physical phases and how these appear in the data. A large measure of simulation work addressed to the CGM has focused on using column densities and kinematics to constrain uncertain mechanisms of feedback by matching real data to mocks from simulations. While these issues are being resolved, it is also valuable to look at simulations from a different phenomenological point of view. The study from Ford et al. (2014) provides an example; their paper identified particles as \u201cpristine accretion,\u201d \u201crecycled accretion,\u201d \u201cyoung outflows,\u201d and \u201cancient outflows\u201d and followed their evolution over time. These insightful categories turn out to be correlated with observable signatures. We believe there is great potential in viewing models and data from this angle, trying to identify the more distinctive or even unique manifestations of key physical processes defined by their fate rather than their instantaneous properties or appearance.", "The next decade should bring a wide array of new instruments and numerical capabilities that will address these unsolved problems. While Hubble lasts (through the mid-2020s), UV absorber samples will grow, particularly those that focus on the z>0.5 regime where a broader set of EUV ionization diagnostics is available (such as Neviii). This increase in coverage will in turn allow more careful treatments of ionization diagnostics component by component, hopefully with a better understanding of how CGM gas is spread across physical phases and across galaxy mass. COS remains the ideal instrument for this problem, and big advances are still possible in the metals budget, ionization and kinematic relationships of multiphase gas, and the relationships between CGM gas and special types of galaxies. Starting in 2018, the James Webb Space Telescope will enable much deeper searches for faint galaxies near QSO sightlines, likely associating galaxies with samples of z>4 absorbers that are already known (Matejek & Simcoe 2012, Becker et al. 2015). Detections of Hi emission (e.g., Cantalupo et al. 2014, Arrigoni Battaia et al. 2015, Martin et al. 2015) will provide useful tests of models for CGM mass and structure, but the problems of gas ionization state and metal transport will require much more challenging maps of emission from oxygen and carbon ions [see Hayes et al. (2016) for a pioneering effort]. Such maps might emerge from integral field unit spectrographs such as MUSE (Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer) and KCWI (Keck Cosmic Web Imager), and their successors on 30-m-class telescopes; limits can be further improved by stacking of multiple galaxies. The optimal galaxies would be those where absorption-line probes are also available, so that emission-line and pencil-beam measurements can be compared. Emission maps of metal-bearing CGM gas (e.g., Bertone et al. 2010, Corlies & Schiminovich 2016) are a key goal of the Large Ultraviolet/Optical/Near Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR; \nhttp://asd.gsfc.nasa.gov/luvoir/\n), which will push to 50\u00d7 the UV point source sensitivity of Hubble/COS and to 100-fold multiplexing in UV spectroscopy. Planned for launch in the 2030s, LUVOIR would be able to directly image the CGM in metal-line emission, map the most diffuse gas with weak absorbers, and resolve the multiphase kinematics of CGM gas with R>50, 000 UV spectroscopy (Dalcanton et al. 2015). The hot gas phase would be addressed by the ESA-planned X-ray flagship known as the Advanced Telescope for High ENergy Astrophysics (ATHENA; \nhttp://sci.esa.int/cosmic-vision/54517-athena/\n) in 2028, with a significant focus on understanding the cosmic evolution of hot gas in the IGM and CGM.", "The size of our samples provides statistical power over the key galaxy variables: mass, redshift, shape, evolutionary state, and orientation to the sightline. Here, future UV absorber samples must be supplemented by optical absorber samples at z\u223c3 and by deeper galaxy surveys at all redshifts. This is a problem for the next generation of giant ground-based telescopes, which will advance high-z CGM studies in rest-UV lines and support low-z studies by obtaining redshifts of sub-L\\* galaxies near QSO sightlines at surveys at z<1 to fill in the low-mass baryon and metals census, which is still a major missing piece.", "Massive fiber-based surveys have proven effective at characterizing CGM gas and its flows with both intervening and down-the-barrel measurements. This technique should only accelerate in the future, pushing to fainter sources, higher redshifts, and rarer foreground galaxies with future massively multiplexed spectrographs (e.g., eBOSS, PFS) on large telescopes. This technique excels at detecting weak signals in the CGM and at examining more and more foreground galaxy properties with good statistics. With larger, deeper samples, we can look forward to addressing questions about the behavior of the cold/dense CGM in rarer galaxy types, such as quasars and AGNs, mergers, and groups.", "Galaxies were understood as island universes long before astronomers discovered the interstellar gas that forms their stars. The IGM was added to the big picture with the discovery of QSO absorption lines and the development of the dark-matter cosmology. Because it is much fainter than stars, and much smaller than the IGM, the CGM is arguably the last major component of galaxies to be added, but it has nevertheless become a vital frontier. As to why, it is clear that much has been learned by viewing galaxy evolution from the perspective of the CGM. The CGM can even provoke fascination: Might the heavy elements on Earth be cycled back and forth through the MW's CGM multiple times before the formation of the Solar System?

Finally, the process of star formation is inextricably tied up with the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.", "The problem of star formation can be divided into two broad categories: microphysics and macrophysics. The microphysics of star formation deals with how individual stars (or binaries) form. Do stars of all masses acquire most of their mass via gravitational collapse of a single dense core? How are the properties of a star or binary determined by the properties of the medium from which it forms? How does the gas that goes into a protostar lose its magnetic flux and angular momentum? How do massive stars form in the face of intense radiation pressure? What are the properties of the protostellar disks, jets, and outflows associated with young stellar objects (YSOs), and what governs their dynamical evolution?", "The macrophysics of star formation deals with the formation of systems of stars, ranging from clusters to galaxies. How are giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the loci of most star formation, themselves formed out of diffuse interstellar gas? What processes determine the distribution of physical conditions within star-forming regions, and why does star formation occur in only a small fraction of the available gas? How is the rate at which stars form determined by the properties of the natal GMC or, on a larger scale, of the interstellar medium (ISM) in a galaxy? What determines the mass distribution of forming stars: Is it the initial mass function (IMF)? Most stars form in clusters (Lada & Lada 2003); how do stars form in such a dense environment and in the presence of enormous radiative and mechanical feedback from other YSOs?", "Many of these questions, particularly those related to the microphysics of star formation, were discussed in the classic review by Shu, Adams & Lizano (1987). Much has changed since then. Observers have made enormous strides in characterizing star formation on all scales and in determining the properties of the medium from which stars form. Aided by powerful computers, theorists have been able to numerically model the complex physical and chemical processes associated with star formation in three dimensions. Perhaps most important, a new paradigm has emerged, in which large-scale, supersonic turbulence governs the macrophysics of star formation.", "This review focuses on the advances made in star formation since 1987, with an emphasis on the role of turbulence. Recent relevant reviews include those on the physics of star formation (Larson 2003), and on the role of supersonic turbulence in star formation (Mac Low & Klessen 2004, Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). The review by Zinnecker & Yorke (2007, in this volume) provides a different perspective on high-mass star formation, while that by Bergin & Tafalla (2007, in this volume) gives a more detailed description of dense cores just prior to star formation. Because the topic is vast, we must necessarily exclude a number of relevant topics from this review: primordial star formation (see Bromm & Larson 2004), planet formation, astrochemistry, the detailed physics of disks and outflows, radiative transfer, and the properties of YSOs.", "In Section 2, we begin with an overview of basic physical processes and scales involved in star formation, covering turbulence (Section 2.1), self gravity (2.2), and magnetic fields (2.3). In Section 3, we review the macrophysics of star formation, focusing on the physical state of GMCs, clumps, and cores (3.1); the formation, evolution, and destruction of GMCs (3.2); core mass functions and the IMF (3.3); and the large-scale rate of star formation (3.4). Section 4 reviews the microphysics of star formation, covering low-mass star formation (4.1), disks and winds (4.2), and high-mass star formation (4.3). We conclude in Section 5 with an overview of the star-formation process.", "As emphasized in Section 1, many of the advances in the theory of star formation since the review by Shu, Adams & Lizano (1987) have been based on realistic evaluation and incorporation of the effects of turbulence. Turbulence is in fact important in essentially all branches of astrophysics that involve gas dynamics, and many communities have contributed to the recent progress in understanding and characterizing turbulence in varying regimes. [Chandrasekhar (1949) presaged this development, in choosing the then-new theory of turbulence as the topic of his Henry Norris Russell prize lecture.] Here, we concentrate on the parameter regimes of turbulence applicable within the cold interstellar medium and the physical properties of these flows that appear particularly influential for controlling star formation.", "Our discussion provides an overview only; pointers are given to excellent recent reviews that summarize the large and growing literature on this subject. General references include Frisch (1995), Biskamp (2003), and Falgarone & Passot (2003). A much more extensive literature survey and discussion of interstellar turbulence, including both diffuse-ISM and dense-ISM regimes, is presented by Elmegreen & Scalo (2004) and Scalo & Elmegreen (2004). A recent review focusing on the detailed physics of turbulent cascades in magnetized plasmas is Schekochihin & Cowley (2005).", "Turbulence is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a state of \u201cviolent commotion, agitation, or disturbance,\u201d with a turbulent fluid further defined as one \u201cin which the velocity at any point fluctuates irregularly.\u201d Although turbulence is, by definition, an irregular state of motion, a central concept is that order nevertheless persists as scale-dependent spatial correlations among the flow variables. These correlations can be measured in many ways; common mathematical descriptions include autocorrelation functions, structure functions, and power spectra.", "One of the most fundamental quantities, which is also one of the most intuitive to understand, is the root mean square (RMS) velocity difference between two points separated by a distance r. With the velocity structure function of order p defined as \n\n, this quantity is given as \n\n. The autocorrelation function of the velocity is related to the structure function: \n\n; note that the autocorrelation with zero lag is A(0) = \u2329|v|2\u232a, as S\n2 (0) = 0. The power spectrum of velocity, P(k) \u2261 |v(k)|2, is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. For zero mean velocity, the velocity dispersion averaged over a volume \u21133, \u03c3\nv\n (\u2113)2, is equal to the power spectrum integrated with k\nmin = 2\u03c0/\u2113. If turbulence is isotropic and the system in which it is observed is spatially symmetric with each dimension \u2248\u2113, then the 1D velocity dispersion along a given line of sight (a direct observable) will be related to the 3D velocity dispersion by \n\n. Analogous structure functions, correlation functions, and power spectra can also be defined for the magnetic field, as well as other fluid variables, including the density (see Section 2.1.4). Delta-variance techniques provide similar information, and are particularly useful for reducing edge effects when making comparisons with observational data (Bensch, Stutzki & Ossenkopf 2001).", "For isotropic turbulence, Sp\n and A are functions only of r = |r|, and P is a function only of k = |k|. The Fourier amplitude |v(k)| is then (on average) only a function of \u2113 = 2\u03c0/k, and can be denoted by v(\u2113); to emphasize that these velocities are perturbations about a background state, the amplitude of a given Fourier component is often written as \u03b4 v(k) or \u03b4 v(\u2113). When there is a large dynamic range between the scales associated with relevant physical parameters (see Section 2.1.3), correlations often take on power-law forms.

The classical theory of Kolmogorov (1941) applies to incompressible flow, i.e., when the velocities are negligible compared to the thermal speed \u03c3th = (P\nth/\u03c1)1/2 (where \u03c1 is the density and P\nth is the thermal pressure); \u03c3th is equal to the sound speed cs\n = (\u03b3 Pth\n/\u03c1)1/2 in an isothermal (\u03b3 = 1) gas. In incompressible flows, energy is dissipated and turbulent motions are damped only for scales smaller than the Reynolds scale \u2113\u03bd at which the viscous terms in the hydrodynamic equations, \u223c\u03bd v(\u2113)/\u21132, exceed the nonlinear coupling terms between scales, \u223cv(\u2113)2/\u2113; here \u03bd is the kinematic viscosity. At scales large compared to \u2113\u03bd, and small compared to the system as a whole, the rate of specific energy transfer \n\n between scales is assumed to be conserved, and equal to the dissipation rate at the Reynolds scale. From dimensional analysis, \n\n, which implies n = 11/3 and q = 1/3 for the so-called inertial range in Kolmogorov turbulence. The Kolmogorov theory includes the exact result that \n\n.", "Because velocities \n\n in molecular clouds are in general not small compared to cs\n, at least for sufficently large \u2113, one cannot expect the Kolmogorov theory to apply. In particular, some portion of the energy at a given scale must be directly dissipated via shocks, rather than cascading conservatively through intermediate scales until \u2113\u03bd is reached. In the limit of zero pressure, the system would consist of a network of (overlapping) shocks; this state is often referred to as Burgers turbulence (Frisch & Bec 2001). Because the power spectrum corresponding to a velocity discontinuity in one dimension has P(k) \u221d k\n\u22122, an isotropic system of shocks in three dimensions would also yield power-law scalings for the velocity correlations, with n = 4 and q = 1/2. Note that correlations can take on a power-law form even if there is not a conservative inertial cascade; a large range of spatial scales with consistent physics is still required.", "Turbulence in a magnetized system must differ from the unmagnetized case because of the additional wave families and nonlinear couplings involved, as well as the additional diffusive processes\u2014including resistive and ion-neutral drift terms (see Section 2.1.3). When the magnetic field B is strong, in the sense that the Alfv\u00e9n speed \n\n satisfies \n\n, a directionality is introduced such that the correlations of the flow variables may depend differently on r\n||, r\n\u22a5, k\n||, and k\n\u22a5, the displacement and wavevector components parallel and perpendicular to \n\n.", "For incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence, Goldreich & Sridhar (1995) introduced the idea of a critically balanced anisotropic cascade, in which the nonlinear mixing time perpendicular to the magnetic field and the propagation time along the magnetic field remain comparable for wavepackets at all scales, so that \n\n. Interactions between oppositely directed Alfv\u00e9n wavepackets traveling along magnetic fields cannot change their parallel wavenumbers \n\n, so that the energy transfers produced by these collisions involve primarily k\n\u22a5; i.e., the cascade is through spatial scales \u2113\u22a5 = 2\u03c0/k\n\u22a5, with v(\u2113\u22a5)3/\u2113\u22a5 \u223c constant. Combining critical balance with a perpendicular cascade yields anisotropic power spectra (larger in the k\n\u22a5 direction); at a given level of power, the theory predicts k\n|| \u221d k\n\u22a5\n2/3. Magnetic fields and velocities are predicted to have the same power spectra.", "Unfortunately, for the case of strong compressibility (cs\n ^Lt; v) and moderate or strong magnetic fields (cs\n \u226a v\nA \u2272 v), which generally applies within molecular clouds, there is as yet no simple conceptual theory to characterize the energy transfer between scales and to describe the spatial correlations in the velocity and magnetic fields. On global scales, the flow may be dominated by large-scale (magnetized) shocks that directly transfer energy from macroscopic to microscopic degrees of freedom. Even if velocity differences are not sufficient to induce (magnetized) shocks, for trans-sonic motions compressibility implies strong coupling among all the MHD wave families. However, within a sufficiently small subvolume of a cloud (and away from shock interfaces), velocity differences may be sufficiently subsonic that the incompressible MHD limit and the Alfv\u00e9nic cascade approximately holds locally.", "Even without direct energy transfer from large to small scales in shocks, a key property of turbulence not captured in classical models is intermittency effects\u2014the strong (space-time) localization of dissipation in vortex sheets or filaments, which can occur even with a conservative energy cascade. (Shocks in compressible flows represent a different class of intermittent structures.) Signatures of intermittency are particularly evident in departures of high-order structure function exponents from the value p/3, and in non-Gaussian tails of velocity-increment probability distribution functions (PDFs) (e.g., Lis et al. 1996, Sreenivasan & Antonia 1997). Proposed methods to account for intermittency in predicting correlation functions for incompressible, unmagnetized turbulence have been discussed by She & Leveque (1994) and Dubrulle (1994). Boldyrev (2002) proposed an adaptation of this framework for the compressible MHD case, but omitted direct dissipation of large-scale modes in shocks. Research on formal turbulence theory is quite active (see Elmegreen & Scalo 2004 for a review of the recent theoretical literature relevant to the ISM), although a comprehensive framework remains elusive.", "Large-scale numerical simulations afford a complementary theoretical approach to model turbulence and to explore the spatial correlations within flows. Numerical experiments can be used to test formal theoretical proposals, and to provide controlled, quantitative means to interpret observations\u2014within the context of known physics\u2014when formal theories are either nonexistant or limited in detail. In drawing on the results of numerical experiments, it is important to ensure that the computational techniques employed adequately capture the relevant dynamical processes. For systems in which there are steep gradients of velocities and densities, grid-based methods are more accurate in following details of the evolving flow (such as development of instabilities) than smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, which have been shown to have difficulty capturing shocks and other discontinuities (Agertz et al. 2007, submitted).", "Spatial correlations within turbulent flows have been evaluated using numerical simulations in a variety of regimes. Overall, results are consistent with theoretical predictions in that power-law scalings in the velocity and magnetic field power spectra (or structure functions) are clear when there is sufficient numerical resolution to separate driving and dissipative scales. At resolutions of 5123 and above, results with a variety of numerical methods show angle-averaged power-law slopes n = 7/2-11/3 (i.e., 3.5-3.67) for incompressible (i.e., v/cs\n \u226a 1) MHD flows (M\u00fcller, Biskamp & Grappin 2003; Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004; M\u00fcller & Grappin 2005) and n = 3.5 \u2212 4.0 for strongly compressible (v/cs\n \u2273 5) flows both with (Vestuto et al. 2003, Padoan et al. 2007) and without (Kritsuk, Norman & Padoan 2006) magnetic fields. Consistent with expectations, spectra are steeper for compressive velocity components than for magnetic fields (and also sheared velocity components if the magnetic field is moderate or strong), and steeper for more supersonic and/or more weakly magnetized models (see also Boldyrev, Nordlund & Padoan 2002; Padoan et al. 2004).", "When strong mean magnetic fields are present, there is clear anisotropy in the power spectrum, generally consistent with the scaling prediction of Goldreich & Sridhar (1995), for both incompressible and compressible MHD turbulence (Cho & Vishniac 2000; Maron & Goldreich 2001; Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2002a; Cho & Lazarian 2003; Vestuto, Ostriker & Stone 2003).", "In order to identify the sources of turbulence in astronomical systems, it is also important to determine the behavior of velocity and magnetic field correlations on spatial scales larger than the driving scale. Numerical simulations, both for incompressible (Maron & Goldreich 2001; Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004) and compressible MHD turbulence (Vestuto, Ostriker & Stone 2003), show that the power spectra below the driving wavenumber scale are nearly flat, n \u2248 0; that is, inverse cascade effects are limited. For spatially localized forcing (rather than forcing localized in k-space), Nakamura & Li (2007) also found a break in the power spectrum, at wavelength comparable to the momentum injection scale. Thus, the forcing scale for internally driven turbulence in a system can be inferred observationally from the peak or knee of the velocity correlation function. If v(\u2113) continues to rise up to \u2113 \u223c L, the overall scale of a system, this implies that turbulence is either (a) externally driven, (b) imposed in the initial conditions when the system is formed, or (c) driven internally to reach large scales. Note that for systems forced at multiple scales, or both internally and externally, breaks may be evident in the velocity correlation function (or power spectrum).", "Recent numerical simulations under quite disparate physical regimes have reached remarkably similar conclusions for the dissipation rates of turbulence. On dimensional grounds, the specific energy dissipation rate should equal \u03b5 U\n3/\u21130, where E = U\n2/2 is the total specific kinetic energy, \u21130 is the spatial wavelength of the main energy-containing scale (comparable to the driving scale for forced turbulence; \u21130 \u2264 L), and \u03b5 is a dimensionless coefficient. For incompressible turbulence, the largest-scale (40963 zones) incompressible, unmagnetized, driven-turbulence simulations to date (Kaneda et al. 2003) yield a dimensionless dissipation coefficent \u03b5 = 0.6. For driven incompressible MHD turbulence (at 10243 resolution), the measured dimensionless dissipation rate \n\n also works out to be \u03b5 = 0.6 (Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004). Quite comparable results also hold for strongly compressible (U/cs\n = 5) turbulence at a range of magnetizations v\nA/cs\n = 0-10; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie (1998) found that \u03b5 = 0.6 \u2212 0.7 for simulations at resolution up to 5123 zones. For decaying compressible MHD turbulence, damping timescales are also comparable to the flow crossing time \u21130/v(\u21130) on the energy-containing scale (Mac Low et al. 1998; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie 1998; Mac Low 1999; Padoan & Nordlund 1999). Thus, although very different physical processes are involved in turbulence dissipation under different circumstances, the overall damping rates summed over all available channels (including shock, reconnection, and shear structures) are nevertheless quite comparable. Defining the turbulent dissipation timescale as \n\n and the flow crossing time over the main energy-containing scale as tf\n = \u21130/U, t\ndiss = tf\n/(2\u03b5). Because velocities in GMCs increase up to the largest scale, \u21130 \u2192 d, the cloud diameter. Assuming that on average \n\n, the turbulent dissipation time based on numerical results is therefore given by", "This result is in fact consistent with the assumption of Mestel & Spitzer (1956) that turbulence in GMCs would decay within a crossing time.", "The above results apply to homogenous, isotropic turbulence, but under certain circumstances if special symmetries apply, turbulent damping rates may be lower. One such case is for incompressible turbulence consisting of Alfv\u00e9n waves all propagating in the same direction along the magnetic field. Note that for the incompressibility condition \u2207 \u22c5 v = 0 to apply, turbulent amplitudes must be quite low (v \u226a cs\n). Because Alfv\u00e9n waves are exact solutions of the incompressible MHD equations, no nonlinear interactions, and hence no turbulent cascade, can develop if only waves with a single propagation direction are present in this case (see, e.g., Chandran 2004 for a mathematical and physical discussion). A less extreme situation is to have an imbalance in the flux of Alfv\u00e9n waves propagating upward and downward along a given magnetic field direction. Maron & Goldreich (2001) show that in decaying incompressible MHD turbulence, the power in both upward- and downward-propagating components decreases together until the lesser component is depleted. Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac (2002a) quantify decay times of imbalanced incompressible turbulence, finding for example that if the initial imbalance is \u224850% or \u224870%, then the time to decay to half the initial energy is increased by a factor 1.5 or 2.3, respectively, compared to the case of no imbalance.", "For even moderate-amplitude subsonic velocities, however, Alfv\u00e9n waves couple to other wave families, and the purely Alfv\u00e9nic cascade is lost. For strongly supersonic motions, as are present in GMCs, the mode coupling is quite strong. As a consequence, even a single circularly polarized Alfv\u00e9n wave cannot propagate without losses; a parametric instability known as the decay instability (Sagdeev & Galeev 1969) develops in which three daughter waves (a forward-propagating compressive wave and two oppositely propagating Alfv\u00e9n waves when \u03b2 \u226a 1) grow at the expense of the mother wave. The initial growth rate of the instability is \u03b3 = (0.1-0.3)kvA when v(k)/cs\n = 1 \u2212 3 and \u03b2 \u2261 2cs\n\n2/v\nA\n2 = 0.2, and larger for greater amplitudes and smaller \u03b2 (Goldstein 1978). The ultimate result is decay into fully developed turbulence (Ghosh & Goldstein 1994; Del Zanna, Velli & Londrillo 2001). Thus, for conditions that apply within GMCs, even if there were a localized source of purely Alfv\u00e9nic waves (i.e., initially 100% imbalanced), the power would rapidly be converted to balanced, broad-spectrum turbulence with a short decay time. The conclusion that turbulent damping times within GMCs are expected to be comparable to flow crossing times has important implications for understanding evolution in star-forming regions; these are discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.2.", "In classical incompressible turbulence, the only physical scales that enter are the outer scale \u21130 at which the medium is stirred, and the inner Reynolds scale \u2113\u03bd at which viscous dissipation occurs.

In fact, the velocity-size scaling within GMCs has power-law index q closer to 1/2 than 1/3 on large scales, because large-scale velocities are supersonic and therefore the compressible-turbulence results apply.

At larger scales, velocities are supersonic and compressions are strong; at smaller scales, velocities are subsonic and compressions are weak. Taking \n\n, the sonic scale is \n\n, or \n\n when q \u2248 1/2. Density perturbations with characteristic scales \u223c\u2113\ns\n will have order-unity amplitude in an unmagnetized medium. In a magnetized medium, the amplitude of the perturbation imposed by a flow of speed v will depend on the direction of the flow relative to the magnetic field. Flows along the magnetic field will be as for an unmagnetized medium, whereas flows perpendicular to the magnetic field will create order-unity density perturbations only if \n\n. Note that the thermal scale, at which the line-of-sight turbulent velocity dispersion \n\n is equal to the 1D thermal speed \u03c3th, is larger than \u2113\ns\n by a factor of \u223c3.", "Another scale that is important for MHD turbulence in fully-ionized gas is the resistive scale; below this scale Ohmic diffusion would smooth out strong bends in the magnetic field, or would allow folded field lines to reconnect. The resistive scale \u2113\u03b7 is estimated by equating the diffusion term \u223c\u03b7 B(\u2113)/(4\u03c0 \u21132) to the flux-dragging term \u223cv(\u2113)B(\u2113)/\u2113 in the magnetic induction equation.

Because the magnetic Prandtl number Rm/Re is very large (\u223c106), the magnetic field could, for a highly-ionized medium, remain structured at quite small scales (see Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2002b for discussion of this in the diffuse ISM).", "In fact, under the weakly-ionized conditions in star-forming regions, ambipolar diffusion (ion-neutral drift) becomes important well before the resistive (or Ohmic diffusion) scale is reached. Physically, the characteristic ambipolar diffusion scale \u2113\nAD\n is the smallest scale for which the magnetic field (which is frozen to the ions) is well coupled to the bulk of the gas for a partially ionized medium. An estimate of \u2113\nAD\n is obtained by equating the ion-neutral drift speed, \n\n, with the turbulent velocity, \u03b4 v. Here, \n\n is the ion-neutral collision rate coefficient (Draine, Roberge & Dalgarno 1983), and mi m and \u03c1i \u03c1 are the ion and neutral mass, and ion and neutral density.

Regions with moderate AV\n \u2272 5 can have relatively large ionization fraction owing to UV photoionization, whereas regions with large AV\n are ionized primarily by cosmic rays (see Section 2.3.1). For example, if the electrons are attached to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in dense cores, the ion density is \n\n (Tielens 2005), where \u03b6CR is the cosmic-ray ionization rate per H atom.

Thus, at scales \u2113 \u2272 \u2113\nAD\n, the magnetic field will be essentially straight and uniform in magnitude, and any further turbulent cascade will be as for an unmagnetized medium. The scale \u2113\nAD\n is also comparable to the thickness of the C-type shocks that are typical under prevailing conditions within GMCs (Draine & McKee 1993).

This functional form can be understood (V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni 1994, Passot & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni 1998) to arise as a consequence of multiple, independent dynamical events that alter the density according to \n\n, where \u03b4\ni\n is > 0 (or < 0) for compressions (or rarefactions).

When the equation of state departs from a simple isothermal form, the density PDF still follows a log-normal distribution over a range of densities, but aquires power-law tails either at high or low density depending on whether the equation of state is softer or stiffer than isothermal (Passot & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni 1998, Scalo et al. 1998; see also Wada 2001).", "For a log-normal distribution, the fraction of volume (V) or mass (M) as a function of \n\n is given by f(x)dx with", "where the mean and dispersion of the distributions are related by \u03bc\nx\n = \u03c3\nx\n\n2/2, and the upper and lower signs correspond to volume- and mass-weighting, respectively. For a log-normal distribution, the mass-weighted median density (half of the mass is at densities above and below this value) is \n\n, whereas the mass-weighted mean density is \n\n. Based on 3D unmagnetized simulations, Padoan, Jones & Nordlund (1997) propose that \n\n. Other 3D simulations with magnetic fields (\u03b2 = 0.02 \u2212 2) have found \u03bc\nx\n \u2248 0.5 \u2212 1 for \n\n (Ostriker et al. 2001). These models confirm that the mean density contrast generally grows as the turbulence level increases, but find no one-to-one relationship between \u03bc\nx\n and \n\n [or the fast magnetosonic Mach number, \n\n]. The large scatter at large \n\n is because the flow is dominated by a small number of large-amplitude modes (i.e., large cosmic variance), some of which are compressive and some of which are shear. With magnetic fields, Ostriker, Stone & Gammie (2001) found that the lower envelope of the \u03bc\nx\n distribution increases with \n\n according to \n\n for \n\n.", "Because the velocity field is spatially correlated, the density distribution will also show spatial correlations over a range of scales. Density correlations can be characterized in terms of the autocorrelation function, the power spectrum, and structure functions of various orders (cf. Section 2.1.1); usually, analyses are applied to \n\n. Using delta-variance techniques, Mac Low & Ossenkopf (2000) show that correlations in density decrease for wavelengths above the velocity driving scale, and that there are relatively modest differences in the density correlations between unmagnetized and magnetized models when all other properties are controlled.", "\nKim & Ryu (2005) have analyzed the dependence of the spectral index on Mach number for 3D turbulence forced at large spatial scales, using isothermal, unmagnetized simulations at resolution 5123. For \n\n, the indices n\n\u03c1 or n\n\u03c1\u2032 of the density power spectrum |\u03b4 \u03c1 (k)|2 are similar to those of the velocity field in incompressible turbulence\u2014i.e., near n = 11/3 or n\u2032 = 5/3; this is simply because \n\n for low-amplitude quasi-sonic compressions (note that even when \n\n, the Mach number for the compressive component of the velocity field is < 1). As the Mach number increases, the density power spectrum flattens, reaching n\n\u03c1\u2032 \u2248 0.5 for \n\n. For comparison, a 1D top hat\u2014corresponding to a large clump in three dimensions\u2014would have n\u2032 = 2, whereas a 1D delta function\u2014corresponding to a thin sheet or filament in three dimensions\u2014would have n\n\u03c1\u2032 = 0. Note that for the density to take the form of multiple delta functions, the velocity field must generally be a composite of step functions\u2014corresponding to shocks\u2014and has n\u2032 = 2 for the velocity power spectrum (as discussed above). The low value of n\n\u03c1\u2032 at large Mach number implies the density structure becomes dominated by curved sheets and filaments. Curved sheets represent stagnation regions (of the compressive velocity field) where shocked gas from colliding flows settles, and filaments mark the intersections of these curved sheets.", "Other statistical descriptions of density structure include fractal dimensions (e.g., Elmegreen & Falgarone 1996, Stutzki et al. 1998), multifractal spectra (Chappell & Scalo 2001), and hierarchical structure trees (Houlahan & Scalo 1992); see Elmegreen & Scalo (2004) for a discussion. The spatial correlation of density can also be characterized in terms of clump mass functions. Clump-finding techniques have been applied to simulations of supersonic tubulent flows by a number of groups; these results are discussed and compared to observation in Section 3.3.", "For observed astrophysical systems, the intrinsic properties of turbulence cannot be directly obtained, owing to line-of-sight projection and the convolution of density and velocity in producing observed emission. A number of different techniques have been developed, calibrated using simulations, and applied to observed data, in order to deduce characteristics of the 3D turbulent flow from the available observations, which include spectral line data cubes (from molecular transitions), continuum emission maps (from dust), maps of extinction (using background stars), and maps of polarization (in extinction and emission from dust). Elmegreen & Scalo (2004) review the extensive literature on observations of turbulence. Here, we mention just a few results.", "The defining property of turbulent motion\u2014in contrast to, for example, the purely random motions of gas particles in a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution or the highly systematic motions of stars in a rotating system\u2014is the stochastic yet scale-dependent behavior of flow correlations. Larson (1981) was the first to draw attention to the genuine turbulent nature of motions internal to star-forming regions, as expressed by an empirical scaling law of the form in Equation 1 with q = 0.38. Using more homogeneous data, Solomon et al. (1987) obtained a linewidth-size scaling index q \u2248 0.5 for GMCs as a whole. Passot, Pouquet & Woodward (1988) pointed out that the linewidth-size scaling \u03c3\nv\n (\u2113) \u221d \u21131/2 observed in star-forming regions is indeed what would be predicted for Burgers turbulence, a more appropriate model than Kolmogorov turbulence given the strongly supersonic conditions.", "Many subsequent studies have been made of observed scaling behavior of velocities, both for subsystems of a given star-forming region, and for systems that are spatially disjointed. A number of methods have been developed for these investigations, including autocorrelation analysis (Miesch & Bally 1994) and delta-variance analysis (Ossenkopf et al. 2006) applied to line centroids, the spectral correlation function (Rosolowsky et al. 1999), velocity channel analysis (Lazarian & Pogosyan 2004, Padoan et al. 2006), and principal component analysis (PCA) (Brunt & Heyer 2002). Overall, analyses agree in finding power-law linewidth-size relations, with similar coefficients and power-law exponents close to q = 0.5. The lack of features in velocity correlations at intermediate scales, and more generally the secular increase in velocity dispersion up to sizes comparable to the whole of a GMC, indicates that turbulence is driven on large scales within or external to GMCs (e.g., Ossenkopf & Mac Low 2002, Brunt 2003).", "Interestingly, turbulence appears to have a universal character within most of the molecular gas in the Milky Way, in the sense that the same scaling laws with the same coeffcients fit both entire GMCs and moderate-density substructures (observed via CO lines) within them. Using PCA, Heyer & Brunt (2004) find a fit to the amplitudes of line-of-sight velocity components as a function of scale following", "based on composite data of all PCA components from scales L\npca \u223c 0.03 \u2212 30 pc in a sample of 27 molecular clouds. Using data just within individual clouds, Heyer & Brunt (2004) find a mean scaling exponent that is slightly lower, q = 0.49 \u00b1 0.15. Note that the lengths L\npca entering the relation (Equation 6) are the characteristic scales of PCA eigenmodes, and may differ from size scales defined in other ways. For example, the effective GMC cloud diameters as measured by Solomon et al. 1987 are on average about four times the maximum L\npca found in each cloud. Based on the scaling law above, the sonic length will be similar, \u2113\ns\n \u223c 0.03 pc (allowing for varying definitions of size), in all GMCs. We discuss this empirical result further in Section 3.1; note that strongly self-gravitating clumps with high density and surface densities depart from the relation given in Equation 6.", "For evaluating the density distribution, the most unbiased measurements use dust extinction maps (see Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007 and references therein). A promising new technique for observing the density distribution uses scattered IR light (Foster & Goodman 2006), which can probe the structure of molecular clouds for visual extinctions of 1\u201320 mag at very high spatial resolution (Padoan, Juvela & Pelkonen 2006). Consistent with the prediction of numerical simulations (Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Garc\u00eda 2001), distributions of extinction follow log-normal functional forms to an excellent approximation; distributions of integrated intensity from molecular lines, however, are not log-normal (Ridge et al. 2006), presumably owing to a combination of chemistry and/or optical depth effects. Column density distributions, of course, cannot be directly inverted to obtain volume density distributions. Because the Fourier transform of the column density, N(kx, ky\n), is equal to \u03b4 \u03c1 (kx, ky; kz\n = 0) (up to an overall normalization; here z is the line-of-sight direction) if statistical isotropy holds, then at least the shape of the density power spectrum can be obtained from a well-sampled map of column density. Assuming isotropy, integrated-intensity 12CO and 13CO line maps yield density power spectra |\u03b4 \u03c1 (k)|2 \u221d k\n\u2212n\n\u03c1\n\n with n\n\u03c1 = 2.5 \u2212 2.8 (Bensch, Stutzki & Ossenkopf 2001), which is consistent with the large \n\n results for density power spectra \nn\u2032\u03c1 = n\n\u03c1 \u2212 2 \u2248 0.5 obtained in the simulations of Kim & Ryu (2005). In principle, features in the density power spectrum should be evident both at the sonic scale, \u2113\ns\n, and the Jeans scale (these scales are comparable in star-forming regions\u2014Padoan 1995). A first step toward identifying features in the density power spectrum, using velocity-integrated CO intensity, was taken by Blitz & Williams (1997). It will be very interesting to investigate column density power spectra based on high-resolution extinction maps in both self-gravitating GMCs and unbound molecular clouds to evaluate the slopes and search for evidence of these breaks.", "Other measures of density structure, including the fractal dimension D \u2248 2.3 empirically measured by Elmegreen & Falgarone (1996), are in agreement with simulations of strongly compressible turbulence (Kritsuk, Norman & Padoan 2006). In addition, the typical range of density contrasts obtained for 3D supersonic tubulence (see Section 2.1.4) is consistent with the compressions required to explain the low effective volume filling factors of gas deduced from CO observations of GMCs (Ostriker, Gammie & Stone 1999). If \n\n (Equations), then the mass-weighted mean density is \n\n, so that \u03bc\nx\n \u2248 1.5 yields a local density n = 103 when \n\n, in agreement with inferred filling factors \u223c 0.1 (Bally et al. 1987; Williams, Blitz & Stark 1995). Observational estimates of the density and filling factor are often made under the assumption of a constant clump density, however, not the broad distribution of densities expected for a log normal distribution, which may introduce some differences. In more detail, Padoan et al. (1999) have shown that the statistical properties of 13CO spectra seen in the star-forming Perseus molecular cloud can be well reproduced by synthetic non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) spectra created using simulation data cubes from nonself-gravitating supersonic turbulence simulations.", "The effects of self-gravity on a turbulent cloud can be analyzed with the aid of the virial theorem, which in Lagrangian form (i.e., for a fixed mass) is", "(Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953b, Mestel & Spitzer 1956), where I = int r\n2\ndm is proportional to the trace of the inertia tensor of the cloud. (It is often assumed that the sign of \u00cf determines whether the cloud is expanding or contracting, but in fact it determines the acceleration of the expansion or contraction; Ballesteros-Paredes 2006.) The term", "is the total kinetic energy in the cloud (thermal plus bulk), where \u03c32 is the 1D mean square velocity [including both thermal \u03c3th\n2 and nonthermal (turbulent) \n\n terms] in the cloud, V\ncl is the volume of the cloud, and \n\n is the surface kinetic term. The term", "is the net magnetic energy, and includes the effects of the distortion of the field outside the cloud. The volume and surface magnetic terms cancel for a completely uniform magnetic field, because a uniform field exerts no force. Finally,", "is the gravity term, equal to the gravitational self-energy (1/2) int \u03c1 \u03a8 dV provided that the acceleration due to masses outside the system is negligible (as is generally the case for dense clouds embedded in a diffuse turbulent background; Dib et al. 2007).", "The virial theorem can also be written in Eulerian form, so that it applies to a fixed volume (McKee & Zweibel 1992); in that case, the surface term for the kinetic energy includes the dynamic pressure \n\n, and the theorem itself includes a term (1/2) \n\n on the left-hand side. This form of the virial theorem is particularly appropriate in a turbulent medium, in which the mass of a cloud is not necessarily fixed. With this form of the equation, clouds that are actively forming or dispersing may have surface kinetic terms comparable to the volume kinetic terms.", "\nBallesteros-Paredes, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni & Scalo (1999) examined the various terms in the Eulerian virial theorem for clumps and cores in their turbulent, self-gravitating MHD simulations, and found that the time-dependent terms on the left-hand side are significant, and that the surface terms are generally comparable to the volume terms. Dib et al. (2007) confirmed this and also found that only objects with large density contrasts are virialized. However, in contrast to the other terms in the virial theorem, the time-dependent terms can change sign, so they become less important if the virial theorem is averaged over time for an individual cloud (provided the cloud lives more than a dynamical time) or if it is averaged over an ensemble of clouds (McKee 1999). In Section 3.1, we discuss the application of the virial theorem both to observed molecular clouds, clumps, and cores, and to condensations identified within numerical simulations.", "The virial parameter is defined as being proportional to the ratio of the total kinetic energy to the gravitational energy (Bertoldi & McKee 1992; cf. Falgarone, Puget & Perault 1992),", "where the numerical coefficient is chosen so that \u03b1vir = 1 for a uniform, unmagnetized gas sphere in virial balance (\n\n; but note that such a sphere is not in hydrostatic equilibrium). This relation implies that the mean pressure in a cloud is proportional to the square of the mean surface density, \n\n,", "where \n\n is a numerical factor of order unity for gravitationally bound objects (McKee & Tan 2003). The total pressure includes the magnetic pressure; fluctuating magnetic fields have an energy that is about 60% of that of the turbulent kinetic energy (Stone, Ostriker & Gammie 1998) and contribute an effective pressure support that is about 30% of the turbulent kinetic pressure support (McKee & Tan 2003; note that \n\n and \n\n appear in Equation 7 with coefficients 2 and 1, respectively). Gravitationally bound objects have \u03b1vir \u223c 1, which (because M \u223c \u03c1 R\n3) defines gravitational length, time, and mass scales,", "respectively. These scales, derived essentially from dimensional analysis, govern the structure and stability of self-gravitating clouds (the density \u03c1 can be chosen to be the central density, the mean density, or the density at the surface, depending on the application). The gravitational timescale is often expressed in terms of the free-fall time, which is the time for a pressure-free, spherical cloud to collapse to a point owing to its self-gravity,", "where the numerical value is based on a He abundance of 10% by number.", "The simplest case of a self-gravitating cloud is a static isothermal cloud with no magnetic field. For a given surface pressure P\nth,0 = \u03c10 \u03c3th\n2, the critical mass, M\ncr\u2014i.e., the maximum mass for such a cloud to be in hydrostatic equilibrium (stable or unstable)\u2014is the Bonnor-Ebert mass (Bonnor 1956, Ebert 1957),", "For conditions typical of dense clumps within low-mass star-forming regions, this is of order a solar mass: \n\n, where k\nB is Boltzmann's constant and the pressure is normalized to the mean kinetic pressure in a typical GMC (Section 3.1) (which is similar to the mean thermal pressure in dense clumps). Note that the Bonnor-Ebert mass is very nearly equal to the characteristic gravitational mass MG\n (\u03c10) when evaluated with the conditions at the surface of the cloud. The radius of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere is R\nBE = 0.486 \u03c3th/(G\u03c10)1/2 = 0.486 RG\n (\u03c10); this is comparable to the Jeans length (see below).", "The importance of the magnetic field to cloud structure is determined by the ratio of the mass to the magnetic critical mass M\n\u03a6, which is defined by the condition that the magnetic energy must be equal to the gravitational energy, \n\n, for a cold cloud in magnetostatic equilibrium:", "where \u03a6 is the magnetic flux threading the cloud (e.g., see the review by McKee et al. 1993). Magnetic fields alone cannot prevent gravitational collapse in magnetically supercritical clouds (M > M\n\u03a6), whereas gravitational collapse is not possible in magnetically subcritical clouds (M < M\n\u03a6); keep in mind, however, that M can change as the result of flows along the field, and M\n\u03a6 can change owing to ambipolar diffusion. The numerical coefficient c\n\u03a6 depends on the internal distribution of density and magnetic fields. A cold cloud with a poloidal field and a constant mass-to-flux ratio has c\n\u03a6 = 0.17 (Tomisaka, Ikeuchi & Nakamura 1988), essentially identical to the critical value of the mass-to-flux ratio for an infinite cold sheet, \n\n (Nakano & Nakamura 1978). For clouds with two other distributions of the mass-to-flux ratio, Tomisaka, Ikeuchi & Nakamura (1988) found that the critical mass-to-flux ratio for the central flux tube corresponds to c\n\u03a6 \u2243 0.17 \u2212 0.18. For more complex field geometries, the magnetic flux does not determine the mass that can be supported by magnetic stresses; for example, if the field is poloidal, with half the field pointing one way and half the other, so that the total flux is zero, the mass that could be supported would initially be M\n\u03a6, but it would go to zero as the field reconnects. For a random field, arguments based on McKee & Holliman (1999) suggest that the mass that can be supported by magnetic fields is comparable to that in Equation 16, but with \u03a6 replaced by \u03c0 R\n2 \u2329B\n2\u232a1/2. Of course, when turbulent magnetic fields are present so are turbulent velocities, which lend their own support to the cloud (see below).", "The magnetic critical mass can also be expressed in terms of the mean density and magnetic field in the cloud (Mouschovias & Spitzer 1976),", "For an ellipsoidal cloud of size 2Z along the axis of symmetry and radius R normal to the axis, this becomes (Bertoldi & McKee 1992)", "where the latter expression uses \n\n. Note that MB\n has the same form as the gravitational mass MG\n, with the velocity dispersion \u03c3 replaced by the Alfv\u00e9n velocity \n\n. Based on the idea that cores form from sheets that are supported by kinetic pressure along the magnetic field and magnetic tension in the (perpendicular) plane, Shu, Li & Allen (2004) have introduced another mass scale, \n\n, which yields values \u223cM\n\u2299 when \u03c3 \u2192 \u03c3th and \n\n \u03bcG.", "Just as in the case of stellar structure, it is useful to consider polytropic models of molecular clouds, in which the pressure is a power-law function of the density,", "where K is constant and \u03b3\np\n is often written as 1 + 1/n. Here, P(r) and \u03c1 (r) represent the total pressure and density averaged over the surface of a sphere of radius r. This approach is based on the microturbulent approximation, in which the turbulent pressure \u03c1 \u03c3nt\n2 is included in the total pressure (Chandrasekhar 1951a,b); this is equivalent to assuming that the random dynamical motions are isotropic. For a given cloud at a given time, this is reasonable for small-scale motions, but the approximation becomes worse as the scale of the motion becomes comparable to the scale on which the pressure is being evaluated. However, just as in the case of the virial theorem, the microturbulent approximation becomes better\u2014for objects that live more than a dynamical time\u2014if a time average is taken. Polytropes are spherical, so polytropic models apply only to objects with well-defined centers; for such objects, an angular average is also necessary, which improves the accuracy of the microturbulent approximation. Star-forming clumps and cores often appear centrally concentrated and are therefore suitable for modeling with a polytrope, whereas many GMCs do not appear to have well-defined centers and are not very suitable for polytropic models.", "For a polytrope, the velocity dispersion obeys \u03c32 = P/\u03c1 \u221d \u03c1\u03b3\np \u2212 1. If the mean density decreases with increasing scale (as it does for an object in hydrostatic equilibrium), it follows that the velocity dispersion increases with scale for \u03b3p < 1, which is consistent with observations of molecular clouds (Maloney 1988). [Because n = 1/(\u03b3p \u2212 1) is negative in this case, such polytropes are often referred to as negative-index polytropes.] The stability of a polytrope depends on both \u03b3p and on its adiabatic index \u03b3, which describes the change in the pressure associated with a given perturbation in density, \u03b4 ln P = \u03b3 \u03b4 ln \u03c1. The value \u03b3 = 4/3 is critical for spherical clouds: clouds with \u03b3 > 4/3 are gravitationally stable for arbitrarily large masses, whereas those with \u03b3 < 4/3 are unstable for sufficiently large masses, or, at fixed mass, for sufficiently high ambient pressures. Correspondingly, the gravitational mass MG\n is independent of density for \u03b3 = 4/3. Polytropes with \u03b3p < 6/5 must be confined by an ambient pressure (Chandrasekhar 1939), and their properties are determined by the pressure of the ambient medium. McKee & Holliman (1999) show that polytropes with 0 < \u03b3p \u2264 1 have masses \u22641.182 MG\n (\u03c10); the mean density and pressure of these polytropes are <3.8 times the surface values.", "As discussed in Section 2.1.5, turbulent regions exhibit a line width\u2013size relation in which the velocity dispersion averaged over a volume increases systematically with size scale, \u03c3nt \u221d rq\n. Observations often show q \u2243 1/2, the value expected for Burgers turbulence (see Section 2.1.1). In general, this linewidth-size relation reflects the statistical increase in velocity differences with separation between two points, rather than the absolute increase in the local turbulent velocity amplitude with distance from a common center. If the medium is gravitationally stratified, however, the central point has a physical significance, and it is not currently known whether in this situation q varies significantly (locally or globally) from its value in a nonstratified medium. Observations of individual low-mass cores indicate increasing linewidths away from the centers, with q \u2243 1/2 on large scales (Goodman et al. 1998); similar observations for star-forming clumps or high-mass cores, which are supersonically turbulent, are not yet available. In polytropic models with \u03c3nt \u221d \u03c1(\u03b3p\u22121)/2 \u221d rq\n, the density follows a power-law in radius, \u03c1 \u221d r\n\u2212k\u03c1\n, with k\n\u03c1 = 2q/(1 \u2212 \u03b3p). In hydrostatic equilibrium, k\n\u03c1 = 2/(2 \u2212 \u03b3p) must hold, so that q = (1 \u2212 \u03b3p)/(2 \u2212 \u03b3p); the value q = 1/2 thus corresponds to \u03b3p \u2192 0. This has motivated the study of equations of state for turbulent gas that include a pressure proportional to the logarithm of the density, so-called logatropes (Lizano & Shu 1989, Gehman et al. 1996). McLaughlin & Pudritz (1996) pointed out a difficulty with previous logatropic models and developed a variant that overcame this problem; however, their model leads to linewidths that actually decrease near the edge of the cloud (McKee & Tan 2003). An alternative model for clouds in which the inner regions are supported by thermal pressure and the envelopes are supported by turbulent pressure is the TNT (thermal/nonthermal) model, in which the density is assumed to be given by the sum of two power-laws, one with k\n\u03c1 = 2, representing a singular isothermal sphere (SIS), and one with k\n\u03c1 < 2, representing a turbulent envelope (Myers & Fuller 1992, Caselli & Myers 1995). A more rigorous formulation of this type of model is that of a composite polytrope, in which the core and envelope of the cloud have different values of \u03b3p (Curry & McKee 2000).", "Cosmological simulations show that self-gravitating, pressureless matter condenses into filamentary structures (e.g., Springel et al. 2005). This reflects the nature of evolution of cold, triaxial mass distributions under self-gravity (Lin, Mestel & Shu 1965): the first collapse is along the shortest axis, and the second collapse is along the (original) intermediate axis, resulting in a filament aligned along the (original) long axis. Molecular clouds often exhibit filamentary structure as well (Schneider & Elmegreen 1979; Mizuno et al. 1995; Nagahama et al. 1998; Lada, Alves & Lada 1999). This may reflect the effects of self-gravitational evolution, similar to cosmic structure formation. However, it may also reflect the effects of strongly supersonic turbulence. Converging turbulent flows produce curved sheets of shocked gas at stagnation surfaces, and the loci of these sheet intersections are filaments. The morphology of cold, diffuse HI is similar to that in GMCs (e.g., Heiles & Troland 2003, McClure-Griffiths et al. 2006), suggesting that at least some of the filamentary structure in star-forming clouds originates with multiscale supersonic turbulence; the filaments that are created by turbulent flows may also be (or become) self-gravitating.", "Virial balance in filamentary clouds implies \n\n, where \u2113 is a length along the filament and m\n\u2113 is the mass per unit length. Fiege & Pudritz (2000) have shown that the virial gravity term for a cylindrical cloud with an arbitrary density profile is \n\n, which, in contrast to the spherical case, is unchanged by radial compression. They also showed that the critical mass/length is m\n\u2113,cr = 2\u03c32/G. Filaments with \u03b3 = \u03b3p \u2265 1 are stable against compression, because the ratio of kinetic energy to gravitational energy does not decrease during compression.

However, observed filaments often have \u03c1 \u221d 1/r\n2 rather than 1/r\n4 (Lada, Alves & Lada 1999). Fiege & Pudritz (2000) have shown that isothermal filaments with helical magnetic fields of the right magnitude can give rise to such a density profile; alternatively, Nakamura & Umemura (2002) have shown that negative index polytropes with \u03b3p slightly less than unity have \u03c1 \u221d 1/r\n2.", "In general, masses in excess of the critical mass are subject to fragmentation. In an isothermal, uniform medium of density \u03c10, the minimum wavelength for gravitational fragmentation is the Jeans length,", "The corresponding Jeans mass is \n\n, where we have adopted the definition of Binney & Tremaine (1987) (the Jeans mass is elsewhere often defined as \n\n, which is even larger than the Bonnor-Ebert mass). For slabs and filaments, there is a fastest growing mode, which will determine the spacing of fragments. For an isothermal slab with a surface density \u03a3 and with \u03c1\nc\n \u226b \u03c10 it is \n\n, where the Jeans length is defined in terms of the midplane density \u03c1c. An isothermal filament with \u03c1c \u226b \u03c10 has m\n\u2113 \u2243 m\n\u2113,cr and \n\n (Larson 1985). These estimates assume that the gas is optically thin; if it becomes opaque, fragmentation stops. Low & Lynden-Bell (1976) show that fragmentation ceases for masses \u22720.004M\n\u2299 (including He\u2014see Whitworth et al. 2007), and that this is relatively insensitive to parameters.", "For a thin, rotating disk, rotation stabilizes self-gravitational contraction for wavelengths greater than the Toomre length \n\n, where \u03ba is the epicyclic frequency (Toomre 1964). In order for a rotating gas disk to fragment, the maximum instability scale imposed by angular momentum considerations must exceed the minimum length for fragmentation set by thermal pressure. The Toomre parameter \n\n, and must be \u2272 0.7 \u2212 1 for gravitational fragmentation in an isothermal rotating disk, depending on the strength of magnetic fields (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965; Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2002). Allowing for turbulence and for the additional gravity of a stellar disk (for large-scale galactic instabilities), the critical Q is larger (see Section 3.2.1). Real gases are not strictly isothermal; Gammie (2001) has shown that in a Keplerian disk, the cooling time t\ncool and angular velocity \u03a9 = \u03ba must satisfy the condition t\ncool \u2272 3\u03a9\u22121 for gravitational runaway to occur (the coefficient 3 is based on 2D simulations with \u03b3eff = 2, allowing for dimensional reduction; Rice et al. (2005) showed that this coefficient can change by a factor of a few depending on the adopted \u03b3). Nonlinear instability develops when Q is small even for adiabatic disks, but gravitational collapse of the condensations that form is ultimately halted if \u03b3 is sufficiently large (Kim & Ostriker 2001).", "The ISM is strongly magnetized, whereas stars are weakly magnetized. How the mass-to-flux ratio increases so dramatically during star formation is one of the classic problems of star formation (Mestel & Spitzer 1956). We shall characterize this ratio by the ratio of the mass to the magnetic critical mass for poloidal fields, \u03bc\u03a6 \u2261 M/M\n\u03a6 (Equation 16, Section 2.2). Heiles & Troland (2005) found that the median field in the cold HI phase of the ISM (the Cold Neutral Medium, or CNM) is \n\n, and that the CNM is organized into sheets with column densities \n\n; the maximum column presumably reflects the transition to molecular hydrogen. It follows that the CNM is magnetically very subcritical, \u03bc\u03a6 < 0.16 (throughout this section; we evaluate M\n\u03a6 with c\n\u03a6 = 1/2\u03c0, the value appropriate for sheets). There are thus two parts to the magnetic flux problem: How does the mass-to-flux ratio increase to \u03bc\u03a6 \u2273 2 so that gravitational collapse can readily occur, and then how does it increase to the very large values (\u223c105 \u2212 8) characteristic of stars?", "Astronomers have two primary methods of measuring the strength of magnetic fields in the dense ISM: the Zeeman effect, which measures the line-of-sight component, B\nlos; and the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method (Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953), which measures the component of the field in the plane of the sky, B\npos, by comparing the fluctuations in the direction of B\npos with those in the velocity field (see the reviews by Crutcher 2005 and Heiles & Crutcher 2005; note that in the diffuse ISM, magnetic field strengths are also obtained by Faraday rotation and synchrotron observations, with results consistent with Zeeman observations). The morphology of the field, which is needed for the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, can be measured from dust polarization and from linear polarization of spectral lines (Goldreich & Kylafis 1981). The largest compilation of magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds remains that of Crutcher (1999), although it must be noted that the median temperature of the regions with detected fields is 40 K, significantly greater than average. Inferring the intrinsic field strength and column density from measurements of the line-of-sight components is somewhat subtle (Heiles & Troland 2005); in particular, care must be exercised in evaluating the average value of B\n\u2225/B using logarithmic values, because \n\n. However, it is straightforward to infer the median values: B\nmed = 2B\nlos, med and, for sheets, N\nmed = N\nlos, med/2. Most of the structures Crutcher (1999) studied are relatively dense cores, so it is plausible that they are not sheet-like; in that case, the median value of \u03bc\u03a6 is 1.65\u00b10.2 [Heiles & Crutcher 2005; note that the values in Crutcher (1999) are based on c\n\u03a6 = 0.12, whereas we are using c\n\u03a6 = 1/2\u03c0], the cores are supercritical, and the magnetic field is unable to significantly impede gravitational collapse. On the other hand, if the objects in his sample are, in fact, sheet-like, then the median value of \u03bc\u03a6 is reduced to 0.8 and the typical core is about critical. However, it should be noted that none of the cores have observed line-of-sight fields strong enough to ensure that they are subcritical, and for many cases only upper limits on the magnetic field strength are obtained. Subsequent OH Zeeman observations by Bourke et al. (2001) have strengthened these conclusions, although these authors suggest that observations with higher spatial resolution are needed to determine whether the relatively low fields they infer (mostly upper limits) are in part due to variations in the field structure within the telescope beam.", "\nCrutcher (1999) also reached a number of other conclusions on the role of magnetic fields in cores and clumps within molecular clouds from his sample: the observed structures are in approximate virial equilibrium; the kinetic and magnetic energies are in approximate equipartition, as expected theoretically (Zweibel & McKee 1995); correspondingly, the Alfv\u00e9n Mach number is \n\n; the observed motions are highly supersonic, with \n\n; and, to within the errors, B \u221d \u03c11/2, which corresponds to a constant Alfv\u00e9n velocity (for sources with measured fields, as opposed to upper limits, the average value is v\nA \u2243 2 km s\u22121, as found previously by Heiles et al. 1993). Basu (2000) showed that the dispersion of the Alfv\u00e9n Mach number is significantly less than that in the Alfv\u00e9n velocity in this sample. He argued that a constant value of \n\n is to be expected if the clouds are strongly bound, so that the surface pressure is negligible, and if \u03bc\u03a6 is about constant. Adopting a median value \n\n, from Crutcher (1999) gives a median value for the magnetic field of", "The value of the density in this relation is N\nH/(4R/3), where R is the mean projected radius. Projection effects could cause the actual density to differ from this, but the change is not large for triaxial clouds of the type considered by Basu (2000).", "As yet, observations of the mass-to-flux ratio on large scales, up to that of GMCs, are not available. The definition of \u03bc\u03a6 implies", "where the numerical evaluations are based on c\n\u03a6 = 1/2\u03c0, the visual extinction is \n\n, and \u03b4gr is the dust-to-gas ratio normalized to the local interstellar value. Typical Galactic GMCs have N\nH = 1.5 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 (see Section 3.1), corresponding to critical magnetic field strength (i.e., such that \u03bc\u03a6 = 1) of B\ncr = 57 \u03bcG for the large-scale mean field. In regions with densities n\nH \u2248 2 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123, the lowest for which molecular-line Zeeman observations are available, Crutcher (1999) reports line-of-sight magnetic field strengths of \u226421 \u03bcG. Allowing for an increase of up to a factor of two for projection effects, and for the fact that the mean magnetic field strength will not increase as the density is reduced by a factor of \u223c10 to reach the volume-averaged value in GMCs, we infer that GMCs are supercritical. GMC magnetic fields are not too weak, however: 450 \u03bcm polarimetry of four GMCs shows that the orientation of the field appears to be preserved during the formation of the GMCs and that the energy in the field is comparable to the turbulent energy (Li et al. 2006).", "Theoretical arguments are consistent with the empirical evidence that GMCs as well as their subparts are supercritical with respect to their mean magnetic fields. Models of self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized clouds show that large pressure contrasts between the center of the cloud and the edge occur only when the cloud is near its critical mass; furthermore, if the kinetic energy is comparable to the magnetic energy, then large pressure contrasts occur only for M > M\n\u03a6. Extending the earlier work of Mouschovias (1976), Tomisaka, Ikeuchi & Nakamura (1988) found that for the cases they considered with 8\u03c0 P/B\n2 = 1, the central pressure significantly exceeds the surface pressure only when M is quite close to M\ncr, and that in these cases the cloud is magnetically supercritical, M > M\n\u03a6. Using this work, McKee (1989) showed that the critical mass is M\ncr \u2243 M\n\u03a6 + M\nBE for quiescent clouds; he assumed that this relation applies to turbulent clouds as well, with \u03c3th replaced by the total velocity dispersion \u03c3, but the validity of this assumption remains to be demonstrated. Because, on large scales, the turbulent magnetic energy is likely comparable to or larger than the mean magnetic energy, and the kinetic energy is at least as large as the magnetic energy (and much greater than the thermal energy), then clouds with \u03b1vir \u223c 1 have M \u2273 2M\n\u03a6. Nakano (1998) has given a similar, more precise argument that the smaller-scale and less-turbulent cores that form stars are also magnetically supercritical. In both cases, the basic argument is that if gravity is strong enough to overcome both kinetic energy (turbulent plus thermal) and magnetic fields (turbulent and ordered) in order to form a bound object, then it is certainly strong compared to the support from mean magnetic fields alone. Note that this argument does not apply to objects that are not bound, but instead are the result of colliding flows (Section 3.2.1). It is of great importance to determine observationally the relative importance of magnetic fields and gravity in the large-scale structure of molecular clouds.", "Most detailed modeling of magnetic fields in nonturbulent clouds is based on the assumption that the field is poloidal (e.g., Mouschovias 1987); such fields always tend to support clouds against gravity. However, the toroidal component of a helical field exerts a confining force, and can lead to prolate clouds (Tomisaka 1991, Fiege & Pudritz 2000). From a virial analysis of several filamentary clouds, Fiege & Pudritz (2000) find that the self-gravity and the pressure of the ambient medium are inadequate to account for the high mean pressures that are observed in the clouds; they conclude that the data can be explained if these clouds are confined by helical fields. The principal uncertainty in this analysis is that in most cases there is no direct measurement of the ambient pressure.", "There are two mechanisms for increasing the mass-to-flux ratio, flows along magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion. In the part of a bound molecular cloud that is shielded from the interstellar radiation field so that the ionization is caused by cosmic rays, the ambipolar diffusion time is about 10 times the free-fall time in the absence of turbulence (Mouschovias 1987) and several times faster than this in the presence of turbulence (Fatuzzo & Adams 2002, Zweibel 2002, Nakamura & Li 2005). However, most of the mass of a GMC is ionized primarily by far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from stars (McKee 1989), and in this gas the ambipolar diffusion time is much longer. GMCs are very porous, and as a result an even larger fraction of the volume of the cloud is likely to be ionized above the level set by cosmic rays. It follows that flux-freezing is a good approximation on large scales in molecular clouds. Mestel (1985) introduced the concept of the accumulation length, L\n0, the size of the region required to achieve a given mass-to-flux ratio when flux-freezing applies, \u03bc\u03a6 = M/M\n\u03a6 \u221d n\n0\nL\n0/B\n0\n. In our notation this yields", "where B\n0, \u22126 \u2261 B\n0/(1 \u03bcG). Using n\n0 \u223c 1 cm\u22123 for the mean density in the diffuse ISM (because GMC columns are much greater than those of individual CNM clouds) and B\n0, \u22126 \u223c 6 for the mean field in the solar vicinity (because the mean field should be similar to the CNM field\u2014Piontek & Ostriker 2005) gives a large value for this length, \u223c 1 kpc if GMCs have \u03bc\u03a6 \u223c 2. In fact, as we discuss in Section 3.2.1, GMC formation from large-scale self-gravitating galactic disk instabilities indeed involves very large accumulation lengths and yields supercritical clouds.", "As discussed above, current observations do not determine whether ambipolar diffusion is necessary for the initiation of gravitational collapse. Theoretical simulations suggest that in the absence of ambipolar diffusion, star formation is strongly suppressed in magnetically subcritical regions, even if \u03bc\u03a6 is only slightly less than unity (Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005). However, similar simulations show that magnetic fields have a relatively small effect in slowing the rate of star formation if the gas is supercritical (Ostriker, Gammie & Stone 1999; Heitsch, Mac Low & Klessen 2001; Li et al. 2004; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Kim & Ballesteros-Paredes 2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2005; Nakamura & Li 2005). The primary effect of magnetic fields may be to shift the initial collapse to higher masses. Simulations with ambipolar diffusion in weakly ionized plasmas are very challenging. In the strong-coupling approximation, in which the ions are not treated as a separate fluid but the field diffuses relative to the flow, explicit MHD codes have time steps \u221d \u0394 x\n2, which is prohibitive at high resolution (Mac Low et al. 1995). If the ions are treated as a separate fluid, explicit codes must resolve Alfv\u00e9n waves in the ions as well as Alfv\u00e9n waves in the coupled ion-neutral fluid. For ionizations \u2272 10\u22126, the Alfv\u00e9n velocity in the ions can exceed 103 km s\u22121, leading to very small time steps. A potential way around this problem is to increase the ion mass and decrease the ion-neutral coupling constant so that the momentum exchange rate between the ions and neutrals is unchanged (Li, McKee & Klein et al. 2006; Oishi & Mac Low 2006).", "One regime in which ambipolar diffusion (or the lack of it) could have a strong effect on the star-formation rate (SFR) is in the outer layers of GMCs, which are dominated by FUV ionization. FUV photoionization slows ambipolar diffusion, and therefore star formation, when it dominates cosmic-ray ionization, which occurs for visual extinctions AV\n \u2272 4 mag from the surface or \u223c8 mag along a line of sight through the cloud (McKee 1989). Suppression of star formation in the outer layers of GMCs has been confirmed in the L1630 region of Orion (Li, Evans & Lada 1997) and in Taurus (Onishi et al. 1998). To the extent that ambipolar diffusion is essential for forming molecular cores, the absence or near absence of submillimeter cores in the outer layers of Ophiuchus (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004) and Perseus (Hatchell et al. 2005, Enoch et al. 2006) is qualitatively consistent with this prediction. On the other hand, Strom, Strom & Merrill (1993) find that there is a substantial distributed population of young stars in L1641, although this population is relatively old (5\u20137 Myr).", "The chemistry of molecular clouds is a full subject in its own right. Here we summarize several developments that affect the ionization, which governs the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field. (a) Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are regions of the ISM that are predominantly neutral and in which the chemistry and heating are predominantly due to FUV radiation (see the review by Hollenbach & Tielens 1999). Most of the nonstellar IR radiation and most of the millimeter and submillimeter CO emission in galaxies originates in PDRs. In the typical interstellar radiation field, photoionization dominates ionization by cosmic rays for extinctions AV\n < 4 mag, which includes most of the molecular gas in the Galaxy (McKee 1989). (b) PAHs, which contain a few percent of the carbon atoms, often dominate the mid-IR spectrum of star-forming regions and galaxies. It is frequently assumed that PAHs have a low abundance in molecular clouds owing to accretion onto dust grains; if this is not the case, they can dominate the ionization balance, because electrons react with them very rapidly (Lepp et al. 1988). (c) H3\n+ is a critical ion in initiating ion-molecule reactions in molecular clouds. For many years, the rate of dissociative recombination, H3\n+ + e \u2192 H2 + H or H + H + H, was uncertain, but careful laboratory experiments have shown that the rate coefficient for this reaction is large: a fit to the results of McCall et al. (2003) gives \n\n cm3 s\u22121. In order to maintain the observed abundance of H3\n+ in the face of this high recombination rate, these authors inferred a very high cosmic-ray ionization rate, \u03b6CR = 6 \u00d7 10\u221216 s\u22121 per H atom (including secondary ionizations), in a diffuse molecular cloud along the line of sight to \u03b6 Per. Models involving two gas phases give somewhat lower values of \u03b6CR (e.g., Dalgarno 2006), but the correct value is now quite uncertain. In dense clouds, Dalgarno (2006) concludes that the ionization rate is \u03b6CR \u2243 2.5 \u2212 5 \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121. (d) Recent observations have established that carbon-bearing molecules freeze out onto dust grains at high densities (n\nH \u223c 105 cm\u22123) in low-mass cores, with nitrogen-bearing molecules freezing out at higher densities (Di Francesco et al. 2007). This affects the ionization, as it removes abundant ions such as HCO+ from the gas.", "Although the chemistry determining the ionization in molecular clouds is complex, simple analytic estimates are possible. In the outer layers of PDRs, carbon is photoionized so that ne\n \u2243 n (C). In regions ionized by cosmic rays, the degree of ionization is given by", "if the ionization is dominated by molecular ions (including PAHs), where \u03b1 is the relevant recombination rate in the chemistry that determines the ionization fraction. If PAHs are depleted, then \u03b1 \u2243 10\u22126 cm3 s\u22121 is the dissociative recombination rate for heavy molecules provided the density is high enough that H3\n+ is destroyed primarily by reactions with such molecules; for lower densities, where the ionization is dominated by H3\n+, one has \u03b1 = \u03b1\nd\n (H3\n+). If PAHs are sufficiently abundant that most of the electrons are attached to PAHs, then \u03b1 \u2243 3 \u00d7 10\u22127 cm3 s\u22121 (Tielens 2005) and ne\n in Equation 24 includes the electrons attached to PAHs. Metal ions can be readily included in the analytic theory (McKee 1989), but they do not appear to be important in dense cores (Maret, Bergin & Lada 2006). Equation 24 is consistent with the results of Padoan et al. (2004) at late times and at high densities for \u03b1 = \u03b1\nd\n (HCO+), which they took to be 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22126 cm3 s\u22121.", "The molecular gas out of which stars form is found in molecular clouds, which occupy a small fraction of the volume of the ISM but, inside the solar circle, comprise a significant fraction of the mass. The terminology for the structure of molecular clouds is not fixed; here we follow the discussion in Williams, Blitz & McKee (2000). GMCs have masses in excess of 104 M\u2299 and contain most of the molecular mass. Molecular clouds have a hierarchical structure that extends from the scale of the cloud down to the thermal Jeans mass in the case of gravitationally bound clouds, and down to much smaller masses for unbound structures (Langer et al. 1995, Heithausen et al. 1998). Overdense regions (at a range of scales) within GMCs are termed clumps. Star-forming clumps are the massive clumps out of which stellar clusters form, and they are generally gravitationally bound. Cores are the regions out of which individual stars (or small multiple systems like binaries) form, and are necessarily gravitationally bound. As remarked above, this terminology is not universal; e.g., Ward-Thompson et al. (2007) use \u201cprestellar core\u201d to refer to a core, and \u201ccluster-forming core\u201d to refer to a star-forming clump.", "A molecular cloud is surrounded by a layer of atomic gas that shields the molecules from the interstellar UV radiation field; in the solar vicinity, this layer is observed to have a column density N\nH \u2243 2 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122, corresponding to a visual extinction AV\n = 0.1 mag (Bohlin, Savage & Drake 1978). A larger column density, N\nH \u2243 1.4 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122, is required for CO to form (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). The layer of gas in which the hydrogen is molecular but the carbon is atomic is difficult to observe, and has been termed \u201cdark gas\u201d (Grenier, Casandjian & Terrier 2005).", "The mass of a molecular cloud is generally inferred from its luminosity in the J = 1 \u2212 0 line of 12CO or 13CO. Because 12CO is optically thick, estimating the column density of H2 molecules from the 12CO line intensity I\nCO (in units of K km s\u22121) requires multiplication by an \u201cX-factor,\u201d an appropriate name because it is not well understood theoretically; this is defined as X \u2261 N(H2)/I\nCO. Various methods have been used to infer the value of X in the Galaxy: In one method, observations of \u03b3 rays emitted by cosmic rays interacting with the ISM give the total amount of interstellar matter; the mass of molecular gas follows by subtracting the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) contribution. With this technique, Strong & Mattox (1996) infer X = 1.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122(K km s\u22121)\u22121. In another method, subtracting the HI-associated dust emission from the total observed dust emission in the IR gives a local value X = 1.8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122(K km s\u22121)\u22121 (Dame, Hartmann & Thaddeus 2001). Note that both of these methods account for all the molecular hydrogen gas, including the dark gas. Allowing for the atomic shielding layer around a molecular cloud (but not the dark-gas layer), Elmegreen (1989) predicted \nX \u221d (G\n0/Z)3/8/Tb\n\n, where G\n0 is proportional to the intensity of FUV radiation that can photodissociate H2, Z is the metallicity, and Tb\n is the brightness temperature of the line. Maloney & Black (1988) concluded that Tb\n should be substantially reduced in regions of low metallicity. Observing the 13CO line is advantageous in that it is optically thin in all but the high-density cores. Conversion from 13CO intensity to column density involves an assumption of LTE (using temperatures derived from 12CO), and a fixed H2 to 13CO abundance. Because 13CO may be subthermally excited in diffuse regions, however, column densities there will be underestimated. Near-IR extinction mapping (Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007) offers the prospect of obtaining more accurate masses, at least for nearby molecular clouds.", "The observed mass distribution of GMCs is a power-law with a relatively sharp cutoff. Let \n\n be the number of GMCs with masses in the range M to M + dM. Observations of GMCs inside the solar circle (but excluding the Galactic Center) are consistent with the mass distribution of the form (Williams & McKee 1997)", "with no GMCs above Mu\n. Here \n\n is equal to the number of clouds eliminated from the distribution by the cutoff at Mu\n. With \n\n, \u03b1 = 0.6, and Mu\n = 6 \u00d7 106\nM\n\u2299, this cloud mass distribution accounts for all the molecular mass observed inside the solar circle excluding the Galactic Center. An independent analysis by Rosolowsky (2005) finds a similar slope (\u03b1 = 0.5 \u00b1 0.1), but a somewhat smaller maximum mass (Mu\n = 3 \u00d7 106\nM\n\u2299, although this does not include the several most massive clouds). These results are necessarily approximate owing to the difficulties in identifying clouds from position-velocity data in the inner Galaxy\u2014in particular, blending of clouds along the line of sight is likely to make the true value of the slope steeper (Rosolowsky 2005). However, the main implications are likely to be robust. First, most of the mass in GMCs is in large clouds\u2014a significant fraction is in clouds with M > 106\nM\n\u2299, and >80% is in clouds with M > 105\nM\n\u2299 (see also Stark & Lee 2006). And second, because \n\n, the upper limit of the mass distribution, Mu\n, has a physical significance (McKee & Williams 1997). If there were no cutoff to the distribution, one would expect about 100 GMCs more massive than 6 \u00d7 106\nM\n\u2299 in the Galaxy, whereas there are none. This upper mass limit may be set by the processes that form GMCs out of diffuse gas (see Section 3.2.1). It should be noted that the GMCs are embedded in more massive HI superclouds (sometimes encompassing multiple GMCs), which also appear to be gravitationally bound (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1987). In other Local Group galaxies, GMC mass distributions have similar power-laws to that in the Milky Way, with the exception of M33, which has \n\n (Blitz et al. 2007). In more distant galaxies, giant molecular associations (GMAs) with masses up to \u223c107\nM\n\u2299 have been observed (Vogel, Kulkarni & Scoville 1988; Sakamoto et al. 1999).", "In a seminal paper, Larson (1981) summarized some of the key dynamical features of GMCs in what are often referred to as Larson's laws. The first result is that GMCs obey a linewidth-size relation: GMCs are supersonically turbulent with velocity dispersions that increase as a power of the size. For GMCs in the first Galactic quadrant, almost all of which are inside the solar circle, Solomon et al. (1987) found", "where R\npc \u2261 R/(1 pc). (Note that the coefficient in this relation is based on a distance to the Galactic Center of 10 kpc; we have not adjusted this value for a more accurate distance because the change is within the errors.) Heyer & Brunt (2004) find that this cloud-to-cloud relation extends to the structure functions within individual GMCs as well (see Equation 6 in Section 2.1.5), and argue that this demonstrates the universality of the turbulence in moderate-density gas in molecular clouds (see below).", "Larson's second law is that GMCs are gravitationally bound (\u03b1vir \u2243 1; see Equation 11). (It should be noted that though molecular gas is generally bound in the Galaxy, different physical conditions can lead to substantial amounts of unbound molecular gas or bound atomic gas\u2014Elmegreen 1993b.) Solomon et al. (1987) determined the masses of clouds in their sample using the virial theorem with \u03b1vir = 1.1, and then determined the X-factor. Including He and adjusting the distance to the Galactic Center to 8.5 kpc from 10 kpc, their value of the X-factor corresponding to a typical GMC with a mass of 106\nM\n\u2299 (see above) is 1.9 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122(K km s\u22121)\u22121, the same as the value determined from \u03b3-ray observations; hence, the GMCs in their sample are gravitationally bound on average. (Note that this argument is approximate because the \u03b3-ray value for the X-factor includes the dark gas, whereas the value from the virial theorem includes only part of this gas, depending on the morphology of the GMC.) Observations of 13CO, which is optically thin, permit a direct measurement of the mass, provided the abundance is known. Such observations of a sample of GMCs in the outer Galaxy, where blending of different clouds along the line of sight is negligible, confirm that molecular clouds with M \u2273 104\nM\n\u2299 (i.e., GMCs) are bound (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001). Lower mass clouds become progressively less bound (see also Maloney 1990), and unbound molecular clouds are for many purposes equivalent to nonself-gravitating clumps within larger GMCs. Based on observations in 13CO and other species that are believed to be optically thin, clump mass functions within GMCs follow \n\n with \u03b1clump = 0.3 \u2212 0.7 (Blitz 1993; Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994). The slope of the clump mass function is similar to that for GMCs as a whole (see Equation 25), possibly because both are determined by turbulent processes within larger, gravitationally bound systems.", "Larson's third law is that GMCs all have similar column densities. For the Solomon et al. (1987) sample, the mean column density is \n\n cm\u22122; this corresponds to an extinction of AV\n = 7.5 mag with the local dust-to-gas ratio. The corresponding mean surface density of GMCs is \n\n. However, GMCs in the outer Galaxy are observed to have smaller column densities (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001), in part because of the greater sensitivity of these observations.", "As Larson pointed out, these three relations are not independent; any two of them imply the third. Indeed, if we express the linewidth-size relation as \u03c3 \u2261 \u03c3pc\nR\npc\n1/2, then", "relates the three scaling laws. Observations supporting a universal turbulence law (Equation 6) in the Galaxy, and thus small differences in \u03c3pc between inner- and outer-Galaxy GMCs (Heyer & Brunt 2004; Heyer, Williams & Brunt 2006) imply that the value of \u03a3 is about the same for all GMCs with \u03b1vir \u223c 1, regardless of Galactic location. Observational confirmation of this conclusion would be valuable. Provided Larson's Laws apply, the mean kinetic pressure within GMCs is independent of mass and size, and is given by \n\n. For inner-Galaxy GMCs, this is \n\n. These results can also be expressed in terms of the sonic length \u2113\ns\n (see Section 2.1.3), because \n\n if \u03c3 \u2248 \u03c3nt \u226b cs\n and \u2113 = 2R. Gravitationally bound objects (\u03b1vir \u223c 1) that obey a linewidth-size relation with an exponent \u22431/2 necessarily have surface densities \n\n. The small observed variation in \u03a3 for the set of inner-Galaxy GMCs is then equivalent to a small variation in \u2113\ns\n in those clouds (because cs\n is observed to be about constant). In terms of \u2113\ns\n, the mean kinetic pressure in GMCs is \n\n.", "Do Larson's laws apply in other galaxies? Blitz et al. (2007) summarize observations of GMCs in galaxies in the Local Group, in which the metallicity varies over the range (0.1 \u2212 1) solar. They find that the GMCs in most of these galaxies would have luminous masses within a factor two of their virial masses if X = 4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (K km s\u22121)\u22121; alternatively, if X has the same value as in the Galaxy, then the GMCs are only marginally bound (\u03b1vir \u2243 2). They conclude that metallicity does not have a significant effect on X because the ratio of the virial mass to the CO luminosity is constant in M33, despite a factor of 10 variation in metallicity. (Note, however, that Elmegreen 1989 argues that X depends on the ratio of the metallicity to the intensity of the FUV radiation field, which is not addressed by these results.) Although there is insufficient dynamic range for clear evidence of a relationship between linewidth and size based on current observations, the data are consistent with \u03c3 \u221d R\n1/2 but with values of \u03c3pc (and therefore \u2113\ns\n) that vary from galaxy to galaxy. Blitz et al. (2007) also find that GMC surface densities have a relatively small range within any given Local Group galaxy, and vary from \u223c50 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122 for the SMC (L. Blitz, personal communication) to >100 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122 for M33.", "There are currently two main conceptual frameworks for interpreting the data on GMC properties. One conception of GMCs is that they are dynamic, transient entities in which the turbulence is driven by large-scale colliding gas flows that create the cloud (e.g., Heitsch et al. 2005, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2006, Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). This picture naturally explains why GMCs are turbulent (at least in the initial stages), and why the linewidth-size relation within clouds has an exponent of 1/2\u2014simply due to the scaling properties of supersonic turbulence. However, it is less obvious why \u03b1vir \u223c 1 and why \u03a3 has a particular value, because small-scale dense structures may form (and collapse) at stagnation points in a high-velocity compressive flow before sufficient material has collected to create a large-scale GMC. Indeed, based on simulations with a converging flow of \u223c20 km s\u22122 with no stellar feedback, V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2007) find that star formation occurs when the column density is NH\n \u2248 1021 cm\u22122, a factor of 10 below the mean observed value for GMCs. They also find that \u03b1vir remains near unity after self-gravity becomes important, although the kinetic energy is primarily due to the gravitational collapse of the cloud, not to internal turbulence. Zuckerman & Palmer (1974) argued many years ago that GMCs cannot be in a state of global collapse without leading to an unrealistically high SFR. Proponents of the transient GMC picture counter by pointing out that most of the gas in GMCs is unbound and never forms stars (e.g., Clark et al. 2005); the global collapse is reversed by feedback from stars that form in the fraction of the gas that is overdense and bound. Indeed, individual star formation proceeds more rapidly than global collapse in essentially all turbulent simulations (see also Section 3.2.2). However, dominance of global collapse and expansion over large-scale random turbulent motions has not been confirmed from observations.", "In the second conceptual framework, GMCs are formed by large-scale self-gravitating instabilities (see Section 3.2.1), and the turbulence they contain is due to a combination of inheritance from the diffuse ISM, conversion of gravitational energy to turbulent energy during contraction, and energy injection from newly formed stars (Section 3.2.2); the balance among these terms presumably shifts in time. In the work of Chi\u00e8ze (1987), Elmegreen (1989), Maloney (1988), McKee & Holliman (1999), and McKee (1999), GMCs are treated as quasi-equilibrium, self-gravitating objects, so that the virial parameter is near-unity by definition. Whether or not equilibrium holds, the virial parameter is initially of order unity in scenarios involving gravitational instability because GMCs separate from the diffuse ISM as defined structures when they become gravitationally bound. For a quasi-equilibrium, the mean surface density is set by the pressure of the ambient ISM (see Section 2.2), which in turn is just the weight of the overlying ISM. Elmegreen (1989) has given explicit expressions for how the coefficient in the linewidth-size relation and the surface density depend on the external pressure, finding results that are comparable with observed values. In particular, the cloud surface density scales with the mean surrounding surface density of the ISM. Even if GMCs are not equilibria, if they are formed due to self-gravitating instabilities in spiral arms (e.g., Kim & Ostriker 2002, 2006) they must initially have surface densities a factor of a few above the mean arm gas density, consistent with observations. Provided that stellar feedback destroys clouds within a few (large-scale) dynamical times before gravitational collapse accelerates, the mean surface density would never greatly exceed the value at the time of formation. Simple models of cloud evolution with stellar feedback (e.g., Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006) suggest that the scenario of slow evolution with \u03b1vir = 1 \u2212 2 is self-consistent and yields realistic star-formation efficiencies, but more complete studies are needed.", "The two approaches to interpreting GMC dynamics correspond to two alternate views on GMC lifetimes. Elmegreen (2000) argued that, over a wide range of scales, star formation occurs in about 1 \u2212 2 dynamical crossing times of the system, \n\n. Ballesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni (1999) and Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001) focused on the particular case of star formation in Taurus, and argued that it occurred in about one dynamical time. The alternate view is that GMCs are gravitationally bound and live at least 2 \u2212 3, and possibly more, crossing times, t\ncross \u2243 10M\n6\n1/4 Myr, where M\n6 \u2261 M/(106\nM\n\u2299) and a virial parameter \u03b1vir \u223c 1 = 2 is assumed (Palla & Stahler 2000; Huff & Stahler 2006; Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006; note that the crossing time in the nearby star-forming region in Taurus is \u223c106 years, whereas in a large GMC it is \u223c107 years). However, GMCs (as opposed to structures within them) cannot be too close to being equilibria, because they do not appear to have a systematic, global density stratification, nor does the linewidth-size relation within individual clouds differ from that in unstratified clouds. (Note that logatropic clouds can account for the observed relation \u03b4 v \u221d \u21131/2 only if they are unbound\u2014see Section 2.2). Estimates (empirical and theoretical) of GMC lifetimes are discussed in Section 3.2.2. It should be borne in mind that the difference between the two scenarios is only a factor of \u223c2 \u2212 3 for GMC lifetimes, which makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous observational resolution purely based on timescales. However, there are major physical distinctions between the limiting cases of the scenarios that are under consideration\u2014e.g., collapse triggered in colliding flows versus a quasi-steady state supported by internally driven turbulence. As complete numerical simulations are developed to flesh out the current proposals, it will be possible to distinguish among them using detailed kinematic observations.", "GMCs are highly clumped, so that a typical molecule is in a region with a density significantly greater than average. Liszt (1993) finds that the typical density of molecular gas in the Galactic plane is n\nH \u2243 3 \u00d7 103 cm\u22123; Sanders et al. (1993) find a somewhat higher value from a multitransition study, n\nH \u2243 (4 \u2212 12) \u00d7 103 cm\u22123. However, the mean density in GMCs is considerably less: because \n\n and \n\n,", "where we have normalized the column density to the typical value in the Solomon et al. (1987) sample. The effective filling factor of this molecular gas is then", "Note that because f \u2264 1, clouds with M \u2272 103\nM\n\u2299 must have column densities less than the Solomon et al. (1987) value if their typical density is \u223c3000 cm\u22123. The small filling factor of molecular gas in GMCs is expected in turbulent clouds (Section 2.1.4). It should be noted that star-forming clumps are themselves clumpy, and contain the cores that will evolve into stars.", "The nature of the interclump medium is uncertain; it is not even known if it is atomic or molecular (Williams, Blitz & McKee 2000). Hennebelle & Inutsuka (2006) have suggested that the damping of hydromagnetic waves incident from the ambient ISM could maintain an interclump medium made up of warm HI.", "The physical conditions in clumps and cores have been thoroughly reviewed by Di Francesco et al. (2007) and Ward-Thompson et al. (2007), and we address only a few issues here. First, how well are Larson's laws obeyed in clumps and cores? Most 13CO clumps are unbound, and therefore do not obey Larson's laws (e.g., Carr 1987); the mass distribution of such clumps can extend in an unbroken power-law from several tens of solar masses down to Jupiter masses (Heithausen et al. 1998). However, Bertoldi & McKee (1992) found that most of the mass in the clouds is concentrated in the most massive clumps, and these appear to be gravitationally bound. The virial parameter for the unbound clumps decreases with increasing mass, in a manner similar to that observed for both the small molecular clouds and clumps within GMCs in the outer Galaxy (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001). They found that the velocity dispersion in the unbound clumps is approximately independent of clump mass (or, because the clump density is also about constant in each cloud, of clump size): the unbound clumps do not obey a linewidth-size relation. Heyer, Carpenter & Snell (2001) find the same result for clumps in the outer Galaxy. By contrast, Falgarone, Puget & Perault (1992) found that unbound clumps do obey a line width\u2013size relation, albeit with considerable scatter. Bertoldi & McKee (1992) showed that the kinetic pressure in the unbound clumps in their study is comparable to that in the host molecular cloud, which is P \u2243 G\u03a3MC\n2 (Equation 12). Further evidence on whether clumps or cores are bound is imprinted in their shapes and density structure and is discussed below.", "It is difficult to determine from the data whether there is a linewidth-size relation within individual clumps and cores. For low-mass cores, Barranco & Goodman (1998) (see also Goodman et al. 1998, Tafalla et al. 2004) found that the nonthermal linewidth decreases and then reaches a minimum plateau level at a finite impact parameter \u223c 0.1 pc from the center of the core. Because of projection effects, however, it is not possible to determine whether the observed turbulence pervades the whole volume interior to that radial impact parameter, or whether the turbulence is primarily in a shell surrounding a more quiescent core; it is also possible that the nonthermal linewidth is due to coherent oscillations of the cores (Keto et al. 2006). A linewidth-size relation in the ensemble of different gravitationally bound clumps and cores is expected only if they have similar surface densities (Equation 27). Jijina, Myers & Adams (1999) carried out a comprehensive study of cores and star-forming clumps (in our terminology; dense cores in theirs) observed in NH3 and found that the objects with and without associated IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) sources each obeyed a nonthermal linewidth-size relation with slopes of about 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. When the sample was divided into objects associated with or without clusters (defined as having at least 30 embedded YSOs), the cluster sample had a weak correlation between linewidth and size with a slope of only about 0.2, whereas the noncluster sample had a stronger correlation with a slope of about 0.6. However, as remarked above, Heyer, Carpenter & Snell (2001) found no evidence for a linewidth-size relation for small (<104\nM\n\u2299) molecular clouds in the outer Galaxy; furthermore, they did not find evidence for a constant surface density at any mass. Plume et al. (1997) observed a sample of clumps that are forming high-mass stars, and did not find a linewidth-size relation.", "The lack of an observed linewidth-size relation in observed unbound clumps within a given cloud is at first puzzling, because defined volumes should sample from the overall structure function of the GMC, which follows \u03b4 v \u221d \u21130.5 (Section 2.1.5). Analysis of turbulence simulations offers a resolution to this puzzle, suggesting that many apparent clumps in moderate-density tracers such as 13CO are not, in fact, single physical entities. Observationally, clumps are generally identified as connected overdense peaks in position-velocity data cubes, with the line-of-sight velocity acting as a surrogate for line-of-sight position. Analysis of simulations shows, however, that many position-velocity clumps in fact consist of separate physical structures superimposed on the sky; correspondingly, many physically coherent structures have two or more separate components when observed in line-of-sight velocity (Pichardo et al. 2000; Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Ballesteros-Paredes & Mac Low 2002). Because low-contrast apparent clumps with any plane-of-sky size may sample from the velocity field along the whole line of sight, the linewidth varies only very weakly with size. Because a fraction of the apparent clumps sample velocities from a range of line-of-sight distances no larger than their transverse extent, however, Ostriker, Stone & Gammie (2001) argued that the lower envelope of the clump linewidth-size distribution should follow the scaling defined by the true 3D power spectrum; this is generally consistent with observations (Stutzki & Guesten 1990; Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994).", "What about Larson's third law? Because gravitationally bound clumps have P \u2243 G\u03a3bd clump\n2, and the mean pressure in a stable, bound clump without an internal energy source cannot be much greater than the ambient pressure, it follows that typically \u03a3bd clump is comparable to \u03a3GMC (e.g., McKee 1999). The high-mass, star-forming clumps studied by Plume et al. (1997) violate this conclusion: They have \n\n with considerable dispersion, which is much greater than the typical GMC surface density \u223c170 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122. There are several possible explanations for this, and it is important to determine which is correct: Are these clumps just the innermost, densest parts of much larger clumps? Do they have much higher pressures than their surroundings but are avoiding gravitational collapse owing to energy injection from star formation? Or are they the result of a clump-clump collision that produced unusually high pressures?", "The density structure, velocity structure, and shape of cores offer potential means for determining whether they are dynamic objects, with short lifetimes, or quasi-equilibrium, gravitationally bound, objects. The observation of the Bok globule B68 in near-IR absorption revealed an angle-averaged density profile consistent with that of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere to high accuracy (Alves, Lada & Lada 2001). Since then, a number of other isolated globules and cores have been studied with the same technique and fit to Bonnor-Ebert profiles, showing that starless cases are usually close to the critical limit, whereas cases with stars often match supercritical profiles (Teixeira, Lada & Alves 2005; Kandori et al. 2005). Profiles of dense cores have also been obtained using submillimeter dust emission (see Di Francesco et al. 2007). A recent study by Kirk, Ward-Thompson & Andr\u00e9 (2005) found that bright starless cores have density profiles consistent with supercritical Bonnor-Ebert spheres.", "Consistency of density profiles with the Bonnor-Ebert profile does not, however, necessarily imply that a core is bound. Analysis of dense concentrations that arise in turbulence simulations show that Bonnor-Ebert profiles often provide a good fit to these structures (provided they are averaged over angles), even when they are transients rather than true bound cores (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). Even if a cloud with a Bonnor-Ebert profile is bound, however, it need not be in equilibrium: Myers (2005) and Kandori et al. (2005) have shown that density profiles of collapsing cores initiated from near-critical equilibria in fact follow the shapes of static supercritical equilibria very closely. The reason for this is that initially these cores collapse slowly, so that they are approximately in equilibrium; at later times, they evolve via \u201coutside-in\u201d collapse to a state that is marginally Jeans unstable everywhere (\u03c1 \u221d r\n\u22122\u2014Section 4.1) except in a central core, which is similar to the density profile of a highly supercritical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Thus, not only the density structure but also the level of the internal velocity dispersion and detailed shape of the line profiles must be used in order to distinguish between transient, truly equilibrium, and collapsing objects (Keto & Field 2005).", "Core shapes also provide information on whether cores are transient or are bound, quasi-equilibrium objects. In the absence of a magnetic field, a quasi-equilibrium, bound cloud is approximately spherical. If the cloud is threaded by a magnetic field that tends to support the cloud against gravity, it will be oblate; if the field tends to compress the cloud (as is possible for some helical fields\u2013Fiege & Pudritz 2000), it will be prolate. If one assumes axisymmetry, the distribution of observed axis ratios implies dense cores are primarily prolate (Ryden 1996). However, this conclusion appears to be an artifact of the assumption of axisymmetry: using the method of analysis for triaxial clouds developed by Basu (2000) and Jones, Basu & Dubinski (2001), Jones & Basu (2002) concluded that cores with sizes <1 pc are, in fact, oblate. Basu (2000) showed that if the magnetic field is aligned with the minor axis, as in most quasi-equilibrium models, the projection of the field on the plane of the sky will not generally be aligned with the projection of the minor axis, and he argued that the limited polarization data available are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the field in the cloud is aligned with the minor axis of the cloud. Kerton et al. (2003) showed that larger structures, extending up to GMCs, are intermediate between oblate and prolate, and are clearly distinct from the smaller objects. This is consistent with the analyses of clump shapes in turbulence simulations by Gammie et al. (2003), and Li et al. (2004), who found that the majority of objects are triaxial. The data on cores and small clumps are thus consistent with (but do not prove) that they are bound, quasi-equilibrium objects. Large clumps and GMCs appear to be farther from equilibrium.", "A key feature of the cores that form individual low-mass stars is that they have low nonthermal velocities, whether these cores are found in isolation or clustered with other cores (Di Francesco et al. 2007, Ward-Thompson et al. 2007). The mean 1D velocity dispersion in starless cores based on the sample of Benson & Myers (1989) is 0.11 km s\u22121, such that the 3D velocity dispersion is approximately sonic. This places constraints on theoretical models, and in particular may constrain the nature of turbulent driving. Klessen et al. (2005) compared the results for cores identified in two (unmagnetized) simulations with the same RMS Mach number \u224810, one driven on large scales and the other driven on small scales; the time correlation of the driving force is short for both cases. They found that only with large-scale driving is the mean turbulence level within cores approximately sonic; in the small-scale driving case the preponderance of cores are supersonic. Klessen et al. (2005) also found that the starless cores in their large-scale-driving models are within a factor of a few of kinetic and gravitational energy equipartition. In the 2D MHD simulations of Nakamura & Li (2005) that implement driving by instantaneous injection of radial wind momentum when (low-mass) stars are formed, the dense cores that are identified also primarily have subsonic internal motions. Importantly, both types of models show that dense, quiescent cores can form in a turbulent environment; the slow, diffusive formation of quiescent cores central to the older picture of star formation does not seem to be required.", "What happens to dense cores once they form? Cores that have sufficient internal turbulence compared to their self-gravity will redisperse within a crossing time. Cores that reach low enough turbulence and magnetization levels (allowing for dissipation) within a few local free-fall times will collapse if M > M\ncr. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2005) found that in globally supercritical 3D simulations with driven turbulence, cores that collapse do so within 3\u20136 local free-fall times of their formation. Nakamura & Li (2005) found via 2D simulations including ambipolar diffusion that even when the mass in the simulation volume is 20% less than critical, supercritical cores can form; these then either collapse or redisperse within several local free-fall times. In both cases (see also Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005), only magnetically supercritical cores collapse, as expected. Quiescent cores that are stable against gravitational collapse could in principle survive for a long time (Lizano & Shu 1989), undergoing oscillations in response to fluctuations in the ambient medium (Keto & Field 2005, Keto et al. 2006). Because they are only lightly bound, however, such failed cores can also be destroyed relatively easily by the larger-scale, more powerful turbulence in the surrounding GMC. This process is clearly seen in numerical simulations; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. (2005) and Nakamura & Li (2005) found that the bound cores that subsequently disperse do so in 1\u20136 \u00d7 t\nff. Quiescent, magnetically subcritical cores with thermal pressure \u03c1core\ncs\n\n2 exceeding the mean turbulent pressure \n\n (so that the core would collapse in the absence of magnetic support) cannot easily be destroyed, however, and it is likely that they remain intact until they merge with other cores to become supercritical. Simulations have not yet afforded sufficient statistics to determine the mean time to collapse or dispersal as a function of core properties and cloud turbulence level, or whether there is a threshold density above which ultimate collapse is inevitable.", "Observationally, core lifetimes can be estimated by using chemical clocks or from statistical inference. The formation of complex molecules takes \u223c105 years at typical core densities, but this clock can be reset by events that bring fresh C and C+ into the core, such as turbulence or outflows (Langer et al. 2000). A potentially more robust clock is provided by observations of cold HI in cores: Goldsmith & Li (2005) infer ages of 106.5\u22127 years for five dark clouds from the low observed values of the H0/H2 ratio. These age estimates would be reduced if clumping is significant and hence the time-averaged molecule formation rate is accelerated, but, as in the case of complex molecules, they would be increased if turbulent mixing were effective in bringing in fresh atomic hydrogen. In simulations of molecule formation in a turbulent (and therefore clumpy) medium, Glover & Mac Low (2007) find that H2 formation is indeed accelerated when compared with the nonturbulent case, although the atomic fractions they found are substantially greater than those observed by Goldsmith & Li (2005). If confirmed, these ages, which are considerably greater than a free-fall time, would suggest that these dark clouds are quasi-equilibrium structures.", "Statistical studies of core lifetimes are based on comparing the number of starless cores with the number of cores with embedded YSOs and the number of visible T Tauri stars (TTSs). The ages of the cores (starless and with embedded YSOs) can then be inferred from the ages of the T Tauri population, provided that most of the observed starless cores will eventually become stars. The results of several such studies have been summarized by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007), who conclude that lifetimes are typically 3 \u2212 5 t\nff for starless cores with densities n\nH2\n = 103.5 \u2212 105.5 cm\u22123. This is not consistent with dynamical collapse, nor is it consistent with a long period (> 5 t\nff) of ambipolar diffusion. It is consistent with the ambipolar diffusion in observed magnetic fields (Section 2.3), which are approximately magnetically critical. Of course, cores are created with a range of properties, and observational statistics are subject to an evolutionary selection effect: Cores that are born or become supercritical evolve rapidly into collapse, and are no longer counted among the starless population. Given a population with a range of intrinsic lifetimes (but similar birth rates), the longest-lived objects will be the best represented. The data rule out the possibility that most cores are born very subcritical and lose their magnetic flux slowly, over \u223c10t\nff.", "The angular momentum of cores was initially regarded as a bottleneck for star formation, but extensive theoretical analysis led to the conclusion that magnetic fields would provide an effective braking mechanism (e.g., Mestel 1985; Mouschovias 1987). Observations have established that the angular momentum, or equivalently, the rotational energy, of cores is indeed small (e.g., Goodman et al. 1993; Jijina, Myers & Adams 1999; Caselli et al. 2002; Pirogov et al. 2003). Goodman et al. (1993) characterized the rotational energy by the parameter", "which is the ratio of the rotational energy to the gravitational binding energy for a uniformly rotating, constant density sphere; they found a median value \u03b2rot \u2243 0.03. The specific angular momenta j in this sample range from 6 \u00d7 1020 \u2212 4 \u00d7 1022 cm2 s\u22121 and increase with size approximately as j \u221d R\n3/2. Interestingly enough, Burkert & Bodenheimer (2000) showed that rotation arising from sampling turbulent fluctuations with a Burgers power spectrum (and normalization matched to observations) is adequate to account for the observations; in this picture, the role of magnetic braking on small scales is unclear. (However, magnetic braking appears to be clearly significant in regulating the spin of GMAs and hence GMCs\u2014Rosolowsky et al. 2003; Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2003). Because j \u221d vR and v \u221d R\n1/2 for large-scale turbulence, the observed j \u221d R\n3/2 relation is what would be expected if core turbulence scales similarly. Li et al. (2004) indeed find agreement with this scaling from cores identified in their simulations. Gammie et al. (2003) and Jappsen et al. (2005) both find that the mean specific angular momentum of cores in their models [using grid-based MHD and (unmagnetized) SPH, respectively] is given in terms of the sound speed and large-scale Jeans length by \u223c0.1cs\n \u03bbJ; Jappsen et al. (2005) show that if the mean density is adjusted so that core masses match those in observed regions, then the mean angular momentum distributions match as well. For cores that collapse, Jappsen et al. (2005) also found that the distributions of \u03b2rot are similar to those obtained by Goodman et al. (1993).", "In principle, GMCs could form either by bottom-up or by top-down processes. In bottom-up formation, successive inelastic collisions of cold HI clouds would gradually increase the mean cloud size and mass until that of a (self-gravitating) GMC is reached (e.g., Field & Saslaw 1965, Kwan 1979). The difficulty with this coagulation scenario, as was recognized early, is that it is very slow; e.g., Kwan (1979) found that the time needed for the peak of the mass distribution to exceed 105\nM\n\u2299 is more than 2 \u00d7 108 years. The binary collision time for spherical clouds of radius R\ncl and density \u03c1cl is \n\n, where \n\n is the density averaged over large scales and \u03c3 is the 1D velocity dispersion over the mean intercloud separation (see Binney & Tremaine 1987, Equation 8\u2013122; note that for considering agglomeration we neglect grazing collisions, choosing a maximum impact parameter R\ncl). Expressed in terms of the cloud gathering scale \n\n in the diffuse ISM, or in terms of the cloud surface density \n\n, the collision time is", "The mean intercloud separation is comparable to 2R\ngath, which exceeds the atomic disk scale height H \u2248 150 pc (Malhotra 1995) for \n\n. We can use Equation 31 to estimate the collision time if all the diffuse ISM gas were apportioned into equal-mass clouds with equal surface density. Using \n\n for the nonthermal velocity dispersion in the diffuse ISM at large (\u2273 H) scales (Heiles & Troland 2003), \u03a3cl \u2248 170 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122 for the mean GMC column (Solomon et al. 1987), and mean density of \n\n typical of the diffuse ISM at the Solar circle (Dickey & Lockman 1990), this yields a collision timescale >5 \u00d7 108 years. Gravitational focusing in principle decreases the cloud-cloud collision time, but in practice this does not help in forming GMCs from atomic clouds because the reduction factor for the collision time, [1 + \u03c0 GR\ncl \u03a3cl/\u03c32]\u22121, is near unity until the clouds are quite massive (\u2273 105\nM\n\u2299). Even if the background density were arbitrarily (and unrealistically) enhanced by a factor of 100 to approach \u03c1cl, the total time of 40 Myr required to build clouds from 104\nM\n\u2299 to 5 \u00d7 106\nM\n\u2299 (by successive stages of collisions) would still exceed the estimated GMC lifetimes. These lifetimes are set by the time required to destroy clouds by a combination of photodissociation and mechanical unbinding by expanding HII regions (see Section 3.2.2). Thus, if coagulation were the only way to build GMCs, the process would be truncated by destructive star formation before achieving the high GMC masses in which most molecular mass is actually found.", "Given the timescale problem and other difficulties of bottom-up GMC formation (e.g., Blitz & Shu 1980), starting in the 1980s the focus shifted to top-down mechanisms involving large-scale instabilities in the diffuse ISM (e.g., Elmegreen 1979, 1995). The two basic physical processes that could trigger growth of massive GMCs involve (a) differential vertical buoyancy of varying-density regions along magnetic field lines parallel to the midplane, or (b) differential in-plane self-gravity of regions with varying surface density. The first type of instability is generically termed a Parker instability (Parker 1966). The second type of instability is generically a Jeans instability, although the simplest form of Jeans instability involving just self-gravity and pressure cannot occur, owing to galactic (sheared) rotation (see Section 2.2). If the background rotational shear is strong, as in the interarm regions of grand design spirals or in flocculent galaxies, there is no true instability but instead a process known as swing amplification (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965, Toomre 1981); the dimensionless shear rate must be d ln \u03a9/d ln R \u2272 \u22120.3 for swing amplification to occur (Kim & Ostriker 2001). If, however, the mean background dimensionless shear rate is low (as in the inner parts of galaxies where rotation is nearly solid-body, or as in spiral arms), another type of gravitational instability can develop provided magnetic fields are present to transfer angular momentum out of growing condensations (Elmegreen 1987, Kim & Ostriker 2001); this is referred to as a magneto-Jeans instability (MJI).", "The characteristic azimuthal spatial scale for Parker instabilities is \u03bb\u03d5 \u2248 4\u03c0 H (Shu 1974). Growth rates are \u221d v\nA/H, which tends to increase in spiral arms; thus these regions have traditionally been considered most favorable for growth of Parker modes (Mouschovias, Shu & Woodward 1974). Numerical simulations have shown, however, that Parker instability is not on its own able to create structures resembling GMCs, because the instability is self-limiting and saturates with only order-unity surface density enhancement (Kim et al. 1998; Santill\u00e1n et al. 2000; Kim, Ryu & Jones 2001; Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2002). Spiral arms are also the most favorable regions for self-gravitating instabilities (Elmegreen 1994), because the characteristic (thin-disk) growth rate \u221d G\u03a3gal/cs\n is highest there. [Here, \u03a3gal is the mean gas surface density averaged over large (greater than kpc) scales in the plane of the disk.] Because the spatial wavelengths of Parker and MJI modes are similar, in principle growth of the former could help trigger the latter within spiral arms (Elmegreen 1982a,b). In fact, it appears that turbulence excited in spiral shocks, together with vertical shear of the horizontal flow, may suppress growth of large-scale Parker modes in arm regions (Kim & Ostriker 2006). Thus, although the Parker instability is important in removing excess magnetic flux from the disk and in transporting cosmic rays (e.g., Hanasz & Lesch 2000), it may be of limited importance in the formation of GMCs.", "Self-gravitating instabilities, unlike buoyancy instabilities, lead to ever-increasing density contrast if other processes do not intervene. The same is true for the swing amplifier if the (finite) growth is sufficient to precipitate gravitational runaway. The notion that there should be a threshold for star formation depending on the Toomre parameter,", "is based on the idea that star-forming clouds can form by large-scale self-gravitating collective effects only if Q is sufficiently low. Here \u03ba2 \u2261 R\n\u22123 \u2225 (\u03a92\nR\n4)/\u2225 R is the squared epicyclic frequency, and cs\n is the mean sound speed of the gas. Numerical simulations have been used to determine the nonlinear instability criterion, finding that gravitationally bound clouds form provided Q < Q\ncrit \u2248 1.5 in model disks that allow for realistic vertical thickness, turbulent magnetic fields, and a live stellar component (Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2003; Li, Mac Low & Klessen 2005b; Kim & Ostriker 2007; these models do not include global spiral structure in the gas imposed by variations in the stellar gravitational potential\u2014see below.) These results agree with empirical findings for the mean value of Q at the star-formation threshold radii in nearby galaxies (e.g., Quirk 1972, Kennicutt 1989, Martin & Kennicutt 2001).", "The masses of bound clouds formed via self-gravity in galactic disk models where the background gas surface density is relatively uniform are typically a few to ten times the 2D Jeans mass,", "depending on the specific ingredients of the model (Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2002, 2003; Kim & Ostriker 2007).", "Observations of external galaxies with prominent spiral structure show that most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the spiral arms (e.g., Helfer et al. 2003, Engargiola et al. 2003), and within the Milky Way the most massive clouds that contain most of the mass and forming stars are strongly associated with spiral arms (Solomon, Sanders & Rivolo 1985; Solomon & Rivolo 1989; Heyer & Terebey 1998; Stark & Lee 2006). The observed relationship between GMCs and spiral structure suggests that molecular clouds are preferentially born in the high density gas that makes up the arms; this is consistent with theoretical expectations because growth rates for all proposed mechanisms increase with the gas surface density. As noted above, collisional coagulation is expected to be too slow in spiral arms; gravitational instabilities are, however, faster (e.g., Elmegreen 1990). Taking the ratio of the collision rate t\ncollis\n\u22121 to the characteristic growth rate of the MJI, \u03c0 G\u03a3gal/cs\n, and setting \u03c3 = cs\n and H \u2248 cs\n\n2/(\u03c0 G\u03a3gal) (because gas gravity dominates stellar gravity in the arm), the result is \n\n. Thus, the collision rate is lower than the self-gravity contraction rate by roughly the surface filling factor of clouds in the arm, \u223c0.2 \u2212 0.5 if the arm surface density is enhanced by a factor of 3\u20136 above the mean value.", "To obtain realistic estimates of the masses and other properties of clouds formed via gravitational instabilities, it is necessary to include the effects of spiral structure in detailed numerical models. Diffuse gas entering a spiral arm will in general undergo a shock, significantly increasing the background density (e.g., Roberts 1969; Shu, Milione & Roberts 1973); gas self-gravity enhances the maximum compression factor and also tends to symmetrize the gas density profile across the arm (Lubow, Cowie & Balbus 1986). In addition to strong variations in the gas surface density, spiral structure induces corresponding local variations in the gas flow velocity (both compression and streaming). Because the Jeans length is not small compared to the scale of these variations, the background arm profile must be taken into account in studying growth of self-gravitating condensations (Balbus 1988). Kim & Ostriker (2002) performed 2D MHD simulations of this process, showing that bound condensations develop both within the spiral arms themselves and also downstream from the arms in trailing gaseous spurs. Based on 3D local MHD simulations (Kim & Ostriker 2006) and 2D thick disk global simulations (Shetty & Ostriker 2006), bound gas condensations formed in spiral arms (and arm spurs) have typical masses 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 107\nM\n\u2299. This value is about 10 times the thin-disk 2D Jeans mass using the peak arm density in Equation 33, or comparable to the value of the thick disk Jeans mass M\n\nJ\n thick = 2\u03c0 cs\n\n2\nH/G, which is obtained using the gravitational kernel \u03a6\nk\n = \u22122\u03c0 G\u03a3\nk\n/(k + k\n2\nH).", "The masses of the bound structures formed via self-gravitating instabilities are comparable to the upper end of the mass function of GMCs in the Milky Way (see Equation 25), allowing for HI envelopes; they are also comparable to the masses of GMAs that have been observed in external spiral galaxies (e.g., Vogel, Kulkarni & Scoville 1988; Aalto et al. 1999; Rand, Lord & Higdon 1999). In addition, the morphology and spacing of spiral-arm spurs predicted to form via self-gravity effects are consistent with structures that have been observed at a variety of wavelengths (e.g., Elmegreen 1980; La Vigne, Vogel & Ostriker 2006). This spacing (of several times the Jeans length in the arm, cs\n\n2/[G\u03a3gal, arm]) is similar to that of giant HII regions arranged as \u201cbeads on a string\u201d along spiral arms in many grand design spirals (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983), and also similar to the spacings of giant IR clumps observed with Spitzer along the spiral arms of interacting galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 (Elmegreen et al. 2006). These giant IR clumps typically host a number of individual (optically observed) HII regions associated with star clusters. Although current millimeter-wavelength observations have insufficient resolution to identify subcondensations within GMAs in external galaxies, it is expected that their internal turbulence would create density substructure, just as the internal turbulence of GMCs fragments them into clumps. Because the mean density within GMCs is comparable to the typical density of cold clouds in the atomic medium, the pre-existing cloudy structure of the diffuse ISM would contribute to, but not dominate, the internal structure within GMCs. In this top-down picture, the more massive, self-gravitating, substructures within GMAs (or analogous atomic superclouds) would then become gravitationally bound GMCs.", "Although large-scale self-gravitating instabilities appear necessary for forming massive GMCs, and many low-mass GMCs may form via fragmentation of massive GMCs or GMAs, it remains possible that a proportion of the low-mass GMCs form through other mechanisms. Several recent studies have explored the possibility of GMC assembly via colliding supersonic flows (e.g., Chernin, Efremov & Voinovich 1995; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Passot & Pouquet 1995; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999; Heitsch et al. 2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007); in this scenario the postshock gas in the stagnation region (which in fact becomes turbulent) represents the nascent GMC. For diffuse ISM gas at mean density \n\n with relative (converging) velocity v\nrel, a total column of shocked gas \u03a3cl builds up over time", "note that modulo order-unity coefficients this time are the same as the result in Equation 31, with the velocity dispersion of the cloud distribution replaced by the relative velocity of the converging flow. Correlated flows can only be maintained up to the flow timescale over the largest spatial scale of the turbulence, \u223c2H \u223c 300 pc. With v\nrel equal to the RMS relative velocity \n\n for a Gaussian with 1D velocity dispersion \u03c3 \u2248 7 km s\u22121, this is \u2248 2 \u00d7 107 years, yielding a column \u22481021 cm\u22122 for \n\n (note that the shock velocity is about v\nrel/2). If the interstellar magnetic field does not limit the compression of the shocked gas (an artificial assumption, requiring flow along field lines only), the postshock gas would have high enough density for significant amounts of H2 to form within the overall accumulation time, and the shielding from the diffuse UV is sufficient for CO to begin to form (Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001; Bergin et al. 2004). However, it should be noted that for a shock velocity of 10 km s\u22121, corresponding to a relative velocity of 20 km s\u22121, less than half the C is in CO after 108 years according to the 1D calculations of Bergin et al. (2004). Turbulence-induced clumping can accelerate molecule formation rates (Elmegreen 2000, Glover & Mac Low 2007), alleviating the timescale problem. The molecule formation rate is proportional to the mass-weighted mean density \u2329n\u232a\nM\n, which is larger than the volume-weighted mean density \n\n in a turbulent flow (see Section 2.1.4). Because \n\n for typical turbulence levels in GMCs, this reduces the typical molecule formation time (Tielens 2005), \n\n, to 1\u20132 Myr. Even so, the discussion above shows that the maximum column density produced in the colliding-flow scenario is \u223c1021 cm\u22122, which is lower by an order of magnitude than the mean value of the column of molecular gas in Milky Way GMCs; thus, this process can account for at most a small fraction of the molecular gas mass in GMCs. Because gravitational instabilities are suppressed by the high Q values in interarm regions, however, the turbulent accumulation mechanism may be more important there. Potentially, this may account for the observed difference (see above) between arm and interarm GMC masses in the Milky Way, as well as for the very low surface densities \u03a3cl observed for many of the outer-Galaxy molecular clouds (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001).", "Finally, we note that the dynamical considerations for gravitationally bound cloud formation apply whether the diffuse gas is primarily atomic, as is the case in the Solar Neighborhood and the outer portions of galaxies more generally, or whether the diffuse gas is primarily molecular, as is true in the inner portions of many galaxies. The time- and length scales involved depend on the effective pressure in the diffuse gas, which includes thermal as well as turbulent and magnetic terms. If the diffuse gas is primarily molecular (or cold atomic) by mass, then the mean turbulent and Alfv\u00e9n speeds will exceed the thermal speed in the dense gas. The thermal sound speed cs\n in Equations 32 and 33 must then be replaced by an appropriately defined c\neff that incorporates the effects of turbulent kinetic and magnetic pressures (the form of c\neff would depend on the detailed multiphase structure of the gas). Similarly, the characteristic timescale for self-gravitating cloud formation becomes", "Turbulent velocity dispersions and magnetic field strengths are observed to be similar in the cold and warm diffuse gas in the Solar Neighborhood (Heiles & Troland 2003, 2005), and both observations and simulations (Piontek & Ostriker 2005) show that magnetic pressure is generally a factor of two larger than the thermal pressure.", "The transition from having primarily atomic to primarily molecular gas typically occurs where the total gas surface density \u03a3gal \u2248 12 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122 (Wong & Blitz 2002; Blitz & Rosolowsky 2004) and where the mean midplane pressure is inferred to lie in the range P/k = 104 \u2212 105 K cm\u22123 (Blitz & Rosolowsky 2006). This transition occurs due to a combination of increased self-shielding (hence a lower H2 dissociation rate) as \u03a3gal increases, and increased density (hence increased H2 formation rate) as both \u03a3gal and the stellar surface density increase toward the center of a galaxy (Elmegreen 1993a, Blitz & Rosolowsky 2004).", "GMCs are born in spiral arms downstream from the large-scale shock fronts and begin life in a very turbulent state. As they contract under the influence of gravity, this turbulence decays, although the rate of decay is slowed by compression. Mestel & Spitzer (1956) conjectured that turbulence would decay in about a crossing time, and for that reason rejected turbulence as a mechanism for supporting clouds against gravitational collapse (see also Mouschovias, Tassis & Kunz 2006, who argue for magnetic support). Indeed, in simulations that do not include energy injection, the contraction eventually evolves into free-fall collapse (cf. V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2007, who simulated the formation of molecular clouds in colliding flows, as discussed above), which is generally not observed. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 3.1, turbulence in molecular clouds is observed to be ubiquitous, suggesting that there is some mechanism acting to inject turbulent energy into clouds. How important is energy injection to the structure and evolution of molecular clouds?", "Broadly speaking, there are two modes of energy injection, external and internal. External mechanisms tap the turbulence in the diffuse ISM, and because these modes are large scale, external driving would tend to yield a power spectrum that rises all the way to the largest scale in the GMC (see Section 2.1.1). In terms of total amplitudes, however, external driving may have limited practical importance. For example, though cloud-cloud collisions could drive turbulence, they may be too rare to be important (except possibly within the denser portions of spiral arms; see above). Magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the Galactic disk (Sellwood & Balbus 1999) connects GMCs to the diffuse ISM by threaded field lines and could therefore help drive GMC turbulence, but it is difficult for this to be effective because GMCs live for only a small fraction of a rotation period (see below), and because MRI is modest compared to other kinetic turbulence drivers in inner galaxies (Piontek & Ostriker 2005). Supernovae are the dominant energy source in most of the diffuse ISM (Mac Low & Klessen 2004), with instabilities in spiral shocks making a significant contribution in spiral arm regions (Kim, Kim & Ostriker 2006). It is difficult, however, for these (or other) processes to transmit energy from the diffuse ISM into molecular clouds, which are much denser (Yorke et al. 1989). In fact, the density contrast between molecular clouds and the ambient medium means that energy tends to be reflected from clouds rather than being transmitted into them [e.g., Elmegreen (1999) and Heitsch & Burkert (2002) showed this for externally generated Alfv\u00e9n waves]. Thus, external energy is primarily limited to the turbulence GMCs inherit from their formation stages.", "Internal energy injection is caused by feedback from protostars and newly formed stars. This mechanism is observed to be important, but it remains to be shown that it can account for the ubiquity of turbulence given that star formation is intermittent in both space and time. For example, Mooney & Solomon (1988) find that one-fourth of a sample of inner-Galaxy GMCs show no evidence for the presence of O stars. Norman & Silk (1980) were the first to analyze the importance of energy injection by stellar outflows. At the time of their work, bipolar outflows from protostars were unknown, and they focused on winds from TTSs. They suggested that these winds would blow cavities that would govern the structure of the clouds. Franco (1983) and Franco & Cox (1983) considered rotationally driven winds from protostars as well as T Tauri winds. They estimated the SFR required to keep swept-up shells colliding at a rate high enough to keep the cloud turbulent, and showed that this was roughly consistent with estimates of the Galactic SFR. The effect of stellar energy injection on the surrounding molecular cloud can be described in terms of an energy equation for the cloud (McKee 1989, 1999; Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006), \n\n where e is the energy per unit mass (including gravitational energy) and \n\n and \n\n represent energy gains and losses, respectively. The injection of energy into a cloud by stars is often accompanied by mass loss from the cloud. Under the simplifying assumption that mass lost from the cloud does not change the energy per unit mass, the specific energy losses are due to the decay of MHD turbulence, which occurs at a rate (see Section 2.1.2)", "For a cloud of fixed size, the largest driving scale is \u03bb \u2243 2R; for a cloud undergoing global expansion and contraction, the largest scale is \u03bb \u2243 4R. Next, consider the energy gains. Because the shocks associated with the energy injection are radiative, most of the energy injected by outflows is radiated away. The outflow energy available to drive turbulence in the cloud is about \n\n, where pw\n = mw vw\n is the momentum, mw\n the mass, and vw\n the velocity of the (proto)stellar outflow; as a result, \n\n, where \n\n is the SFR and M is the cloud (or clump) mass. Balancing the energy gains and losses, \n\n, then gives the SFR necessary to maintain the turbulent motions. Norman & Silk (1980), Franco (1983), and McKee (1989) all estimated outflow momenta pw\n/m\n\\* \u2243 50 \u2212 70 km s\u22121 for a typical stellar mass m\n\\* = 0.5 M\n\u2299 and found that the energy injection rate was sufficient to support star-forming clouds against collapse. Li & Nakamura (2006) and Nakamura & Li (2007) have carried out 3D MHD simulations of a forming star cluster and found that the rate at which energy is input from protostellar winds maintains the surrounding gas in approximate virial equilibrium. Matzner (2007) has given a general discussion of turbulence driven by protostellar outflows. In particular, he has shown on the basis of dimensional analysis that if outflows occur at a rate per unit volume \n\n and inject an average momentum \n\n into a medium of density \u03c10, then on scales small compared to that at which the outflows overlap, the linewidth-size relation is \n\n, where the coefficient is of order unity.", "There are both observational and theoretical caveats to this picture. Observationally, Richer et al. (2000) cite pw\n/m\n\\* \u2243 0.3vK\n, where vK\n is the Keplerian velocity at the stellar surface; for vK\n \u2243 200 km s\u22121, this is pw\n/m\n\\* \u2243 60 km s\u22121, in agreement with the values used in these models of energy injection and in agreement with both X-wind and disk models of protostellar outflows. However, some recent observations are in striking disagreement with these estimates: Based on observations of CO outflows by Bontemps et al. (1996), Walawender, Bally & Reipurth (2005) infer a much lower average outflow momentum pw\n = 1.2 M\n\u2299 km s\u22121 (it should be noted, however, that they infer a much larger momentum, pw\n = 18 M\n\u2299 km s\u22121, in a protostellar jet). Quillen et al. (2005) discovered a number of CO cavities in NGC 1333, which they identified as fossil outflows with pw\n \u223c 1 M\n\u2299 km s\u22121; this estimate of the momentum has been confirmed in numerical simulations of fossil outflows (Cunningham et al. 2006). Like Walawender, Bally & Reipurth, they concluded that these outflows could support a region of active star formation like NGC 1333 against gravity, but outflows could not support the larger Perseus cloud in which it is embedded. Clearly, more observational work is needed to determine the rate of protostellar energy injection.", "The theoretical caveat is that protostellar outflows are unlikely to be effective on the scale of GMCs. Turbulent driving yields a flat power spectrum at scales larger than the input scale of turbulence, regardless of magnetization (see Section 2.1.1). Because the scale of protostellar jets and outflows is small compared to that of a GMC, driving by low-mass stars is inconsistent with observed turbulence spectra that continue rising up to scales of tens of parsecs (see Section 2.1.5); this effect is partly ameliorated by the clustering of stars, because protostellar outflows from a cluster will extend to larger scales than those from individual stars. Protostellar outflows remain a viable energy source for clumps and cores within GMCs, however.", "Massive stars can inject more momentum into GMCs through HII regions than do the much more numerous low-mass stars through their outflows (Matzner 2002); in addition, HII regions can inject energy on the scale of the GMC (\nFigure 2\n), overcoming the limitation of protostellar outflows in this regard. The dominant destruction mechanism for GMCs is via photoevaporation by blister HII regions (see below). The momentum given to a GMC by the loss of a mass \u03b4 M in a blister HII region is about 2c\nII \u03b4 M, where c\nII \u2243 10 km s\u22121 is the sound speed in the HII region (the factor 2 represents the sum of the thermal and ram pressures in a blister HII region). If the overall star-formation efficiency is \u03b5GMC, then a cloud of initial mass M will form a mass of stars \u03b5GMC\nM and will lose a mass (1 \u2212 \u03b5GMC)M via photoevaporation. The ratio of the momentum given to the cloud by HII regions to that given by protostellar winds is then", "where we used the value pw\n/m\n\\* \u2243 60 km s\u22121 from Richer et al. (2000); if protostellar momentum injection is less efficient than this, then HII regions are correspondingly more important. (Note that if the cloud is disrupted before it is photoevaporated, as can happen to smaller GMCs\u2014see below\u2014both the mass loss and the star formation will be reduced, but p\nHII/pw\n will be relatively unaffected.) For GMCs, which have star-formation efficiencies \u03b5GMC about a few percent, HII regions dominate the energy injection by an order of magnitude. Large OB associations do not occur in small molecular clouds, so photoevaporation is less important in such clouds; Matzner (2002) estimates that protostellar outflows dominate the energy injection for clouds with masses \u22724 \u00d7 104\nM\n\u2299.", "", "\n Figure 2\u2002\n Click to view", "", "The same HII regions that inject energy to support GMCs also destroy them. Blitz & Shu (1980) estimated that HII regions would inject enough energy to unbind a GMC in about 107 years. Using a simple analytic model for the evolution of blister HII regions developed by Whitworth (1979) and confirmed in numerical simulations by Yorke et al. (1989), Williams & McKee (1997) concluded that an expanding HII region would sweep up more mass than it ionized, so that a very large HII region would disrupt the cloud before ionizing it. The condition for cloud disruption\u2014that the cloud be engulfed by the HII region\u2014is difficult to meet for massive GMCs (\u2273106\nM\n\u2299), but relatively common for small GMCs. Indeed, the Orion molecular cloud may well have been disrupted by previous generations of star formation. If one assumes that the specific SFR is independent of GMC mass, then the observed rate of star formation in the Galaxy implies that GMCs with masses \u223c106\nM\n\u2299 live for about 30 Myr. Matzner (2002) assumed that the SFR in a cloud is self-regulating and found that the specific SFR increases with cloud mass; as a result, he obtained smaller lifetimes for large GMCs, \u223c20 Myr. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) obtained a similar value with a more complete model for GMC evolution (see below).", "Observational estimates of GMC lifetimes are difficult, although chemical clocks can be used to measure the lifetime of clumps and cores within them (see Section 3.1.2). For the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, Blitz et al. (2007) discuss empirical measures of GMC lifetimes based on their spatial correlation with HII regions and young clusters and associations. About 25% of the GMCs show no evidence for high-mass star formation. This can be interpreted as a delay in the onset of star formation due either to the effects of magnetic fields (McKee 1989, Tassis & Mouschovias 2004), or to the time required to create cluster-forming clumps in a turbulent cloud (from simulations this time is \u223c1 \u2212 3t\nff; e.g., Heitsch, Mac Low & Klessen 2001; Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni et al. 2005); alternatively, if the SFR undergoes significant fluctuations (e.g., Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006), it could simply represent a lull in the SFR. In the LMC, about 60% of star clusters with ages <10 Myr are within 40 pc of a GMC, whereas older clusters have no significant spatial correlation with GMCs; Blitz et al. (2007) therefore infer that GMCs are destroyed within about 6 Myr of cluster formation. There are also slightly more than twice as many clouds harboring small HII regions as those containing large HII regions and clusters; they infer a lifetime of 14 Myr for this stage. These statistics imply that the typical time interval between when an HII region turns on and when the cloud is destroyed is \u223c20 Myr. Including the GMCs without high-mass stars, they infer a total GMC lifetime of 27 Myr. There are several caveats to this analysis, however. First, the GMCs are identified only by their CO emission; because CO is more readily destroyed in the low-metallicity environment of the LMC than in the Galaxy (van Dishoeck & Black 1988), some GMCs could have been missed, both in the early stages of evolution when the density is low and in the late stage when the UV flux is high. Second, the mean mass of the clouds increases in going from the starless sample and the small-HII sample to the cluster sample; in fact, the two largest clouds are in the cluster sample, and overall just 10\u201315% of massive (M > 105.5\nM\n\u2299) GMCs in the LMC and M33 lack (high-mass) star formation. The naive interpretation of this secular trend is that massive GMCs (which contain most of the molecular mass) have a more rapid onset of star formation than do low-mass clouds, although this is not a unique explanation. Next, the associations are unbound and dissolve rapidly; clusters dissolve more slowly, but one still cannot assume that their relative numbers accurately track the relative lifetimes. It is not clear how these latter two issues affect the analysis. Finally, large associations could displace the clouds by the rocket effect rather than destroy them (a process termed cloud shuffling by Elmegreen 1979). Nonetheless, observations of extragalactic GMCs offer the most promising avenue for getting an observational handle on GMC evolution.", "How do GMCs and the star-forming clumps within them evolve in the presence of stellar and protostellar feedback? In the quasi-static approximation, a molecular cloud will be in approximate virial equilibrium. Under the additional assumption that the rate-limiting step in star formation is ambipolar diffusion, McKee (1989) found that GMCs contract under the influence of their self-gravity until the contraction is halted by stellar feedback; the equilibrium is stable and the column density is AV\n \u2243 4 \u2212 8 mag, comparable to the observed value. Dropping the assumption of quasi-static evolution and using the time-dependent virial theorem for a spherical, homologous cloud, Matzner & McKee (1999) found that a star-forming clump undergoes several bursts of star formation. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) extended this work by using a theory for the SFR that is consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (Krumholz & McKee 2005\u2014see Section 3.4) and the full time-dependent virial and energy equations to solve for the evolution of GMCs that are large enough (\u2273 105\nM\n\u2299) that HII regions dominate the energy injection (Matzner 2002). Their time-dependent integrations assume spherical, homologous evolution for each GMC, and follow the formation and dynamical effects of many individual HII regions, with stars selected from the IMF. Blister HII regions act to destroy the clouds, but they also provide a confining pressure owing to the recoil associated with the mass loss. The prinicipal results of the time-dependent models are (a) clouds live for a few crossing times, \u223c30 Myr for clouds with M \u2273 106\nM\n\u2299, in agreement with observational estimates; (b) clouds are close to equilibrium, with virial parameters \u03b1vir \u2243 1 \u2212 2; (c) the column density of the clouds is N\nH \u2243 1022 cm\u22122, in agreement with observations; (d) large clouds are destroyed by photoevaporation, but small clouds (M \u2272 2 \u00d7 105\nM\n\u2299) are disrupted before half their mass is photoionized; and (e) GMCs convert \u223c5 \u2212 10% of their mass into stars before they are destroyed. HII regions are unable to support GMCs with columns significantly greater than 1022 cm\u22122. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) conjecture that such clouds can occur in regions in which the mean density is not much less than the density in the GMCs, so that external driving is more efficient; such conditions could occur in starbursts. Testing and extension of these cloud evolution/destruction models via full 3D numerical simulations has not yet been attempted, but development and verification of the necessary computational codes is well underway (Krumholz, Stone & Gardiner 2007, submitted; Mac Low et al. 2007, submitted; Mellema et al. 2006).", "How is the distribution of stellar masses, or IMF, established? This is one of most basic questions a complete theory of star formation must answer, but also one of the most difficult. Current evidence suggests that the IMF is quite similar in many different locations throughout the Milky Way, with the possible exception of star clusters formed very near the Galactic Center (Scalo 1998b presents evidence for significant variations in the IMF, but Elmegreen 1999 argues that much, if not all, of this is consistent with the expected statistical variations). The standard IMF of Kroupa (2001) is a three-part power-law with breaks at 0.08 M\n\u2299 and 0.5 M\n\u2299; i.e., \n\n with \u03b1 = 1.3 for 0.5 < m\n\\*/M\n\u2299 < 50, \u03b1 = 0.3 for 0.08 < m\n\\*/M\n\u2299 < 0.5, and \u03b1 = \u22120.7 for 0.01 < m\n\\*/M\n\u2299 < 0.08. The slope of the IMF at m\n\\* \u2273 M\n\u2299 was originally identified by Salpeter (1955), who found \u03b1 = 1.35. Up to \u223c 1 M\n\u2299, a log-normal functional form \n\n provides a smooth fit for the observed mass distribution (Miller & Scalo 1979), with Chabrier (2005) finding that mc\n \u2248 0.2 M\n\u2299 and \u03c3 \u2248 0.55 apply both for individual stars in the disk and in young clusters; the system IMF (i.e., counting binaries as single systems) has mc\n = 0.25 M\n\u2299. Thus, the main properties of the IMF that any theory must explain are (a) the Salpeter power-law slope at high mass, (b) the break and turnover slightly below \u223c1 M\n\u2299, (c) the upper limit on stellar masses \u223c150 M\n\u2299 (Elmegreen 2000, Figer 2005, Oey & Clarke 2005), and (d) the universality of these features over a wide range of star-forming environments, apparently independent of the mean density, turbulence level, magnetic field strength, and to large extent also metallicity. Theory predicts that there should be a lower limit on (sub)stellar masses (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976), but this has not been confirmed observationally.", "Important additional information has been provided by recent millimeter and submillimeter continuum surveys covering both cluster regions and larger areas in star-forming systems (e.g., Motte, Andr\u00e9 & Neri 1998; Testi & Sargent 1998; Johnstone et al. 2000, 2001; Motte et al. 2001; Beuther & Schilke 2004; Reid & Wilson 2005, 2006a; Stanke et al. 2006; Enoch et al. 2006; Nutter & Ward-Thompson 2007). Within continuum maps, high-density concentrations representing (starless) cores have been identified in sufficient numbers (and with sufficent resolution) that core mass functions (CMFs) analogous to the IMF can be defined. Similar CMFs may be derived using extinction data from well-sampled maps (Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007) and molecular line maps in high-density tracers (Onishi et al. 2002). Studies of the CMF using extinction maps are only just beginning, but they promise to be very important given the lower systematic errors that are possible with this method. An excellent recent summary of the statistical properties of observed cores is given by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007).", "The CMFs derived from many independent studies and methods are in good agreement with each other, and are remarkably similar in functional form to the stellar IMF. In particular, regardless of the total mass and size of the star-forming cloud, and regardless of whether cores are well separated or highly clustered, the high-end CMF (above 1 M\n\u2299) is consistent with a power-law. Applying a uniform analysis to data from 11 high- and low-mass star-forming regions, Reid & Wilson (2006b) find \u03b1 = 0.8 \u2212 2.1, with the mean value \u03b1 = 1.4. Observed CMFs for relatively nearby clouds in the references cited above also show a peak and turnover at low mass in the range of \u223c0.2 \u2212 1 M\n\u2299. For distant clouds, the peak core mass is larger, but lack of resolution and hence low-mass incompleteness affects these results. Observed well-resolved CMF distributions are thus very similar to the stellar IMF, but shifted to higher mass by a factor of a few. For CMFs derived from millimeter and submillimeter observations, this factor involves some uncertainty associated with conversion from dust emissivity to total mass. The CMF derived from extinction in the Pipe nebula, which is not subject to this uncertainty, is shifted to higher masses by a factor of three with respect to the standard stellar IMF (Alves, Lombardi & Lada 2007).", "The mirroring of the universal IMF by the (possibly also universal) CMF suggests that the stellar mass distribution is imposed early in the star-forming process. The final mass of a star appears to be controlled by the available reservoir of the core from which it forms, rather than, for example, being defined by a termination of accretion owing to internal stellar processes. The shift of the observed CMF relative to the IMF nevertheless implies that stellar feedback and other processes in the collapse or postcollapse stage affect stellar masses. Magnetized protostellar disk winds are believed to reduce the stellar mass compared to core mass by a factor of a few (see discussion in Section 4.2.6). In particular, Matzner & McKee (2000) predicted that the efficiency of a single star-formation event in an individual core is \u03b5core \u2248 0.25 \u2212 0.7, depending on the degree of flattening, which is comparable to the values implied by the observations cited above. Because the efficiency is not sensitive to the parameters involved, this implies a similar shift from CMF to IMF at all masses. Given the uncertainty in the CMF normalization, the inefficiency of single star formation may account for essentially the whole CMF\u2192IMF shift. Some further fragmentation of presently observed massive cores during their collapse may also occur, but provided that the majority of the mass goes into a single object, this will leave the high-mass end of the CMF relatively unchanged. Because the CMF is already dominated by low-mass cores (by mass as well as by number), the addition of low-mass stars formed as fragments from collapsing high-mass cores would negligibly affect the low-mass end of the IMF.", "Molecular line observations of low-mass cores, whether found in isolation (as in Taurus) or in close proximity to other cores in a dense, cluster-forming clump (as in \u03c1 Oph), show that these cores have very low nonthermal internal velocities (Andr\u00e9 et al. 2007). Because weak internal turbulence implies that little density substructure is present within these cores, they are unlikely to undergo subsequent fragmentation during collapse, except to form binaries. The low-mass portion of the CMF should therefore be conserved in mapping to the IMF, modulo mass removal by outflows. Although cores in the high-mass end of the CMF are turbulent and thus, in principle, subject to further fragmentation, the agreement between the CMF and IMF suggests that this is not a dominant effect.", "The environments of observed prestellar cores provide further clues to the processes involved in their formation. Most stars form in clusters (Lada & Lada 2003; see Section 4.3.5), and correspondingly, most (starless) molecular cores are part of larger cluster-forming dense clumps. These cluster-forming clumps [referred to as cluster-forming cores by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007)], as observed for example in Ophiuchus, Serpens, Perseus, and Orion, have supersonic internal turbulent linewidths (even though the individual cores within them are subthermal). Compared to isolated cores, the cores in clusters tend to be more compact in overall size and have higher densities and column densities; they are also lower in mass (Ward-Thompson et al. 2007). The column densities of cluster-forming clumps are generally quite large, and in particular they exceed the mean column densities of the GMCs in which they are formed. In Perseus, where 80% of the millimeter cores lie in groups and 50% are in clusters (Enoch et al. 2006), 50% of the total cloud mass is at AV\n < 4 and 80% is at AV\n < 6, whereas 90% of the mass in prestellar cores is in larger structures that have AV\n > 6, and 50% is at AV\n > 8 (Kirk, Johnstone & Di Francesco 2006). Similarly in Ophiuchus, the prestellar cores are found in high-column density regions (AV\n > 15 for > 90% of the core mass), whereas most of the cloud's mass has much lower column densities (70% is at AV\n < 7) (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004). The prestellar cores themselves represent only a tiny fraction of the total cloud mass: 5% in Perseus (Enoch et al. 2006), and 3% in Ophiuchus (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004); this is comparable to the net observed star-formation efficiency over the lifetime of a GMC (see Section 3.4). On the largest scales, GMCs generally consist of collections of filaments, and both the clusters of cores and most of the individual isolated cores are embedded in these filaments. The structure formation that produces cores, and eventually stars, is therefore clearly a hierarchical process.", "Many theories have been proposed that aim to explain the IMF or some aspect of it, and more recently to explain the CMF as well (see Elmegreen 2001 and Bonnell, Larson & Zinnecker 2007 for recent reviews). Although none of the proposals to date have won general acceptance, several have introduced elements that are likely to be important in the eventual theory that is developed. Numerical simulations have been valuable in demonstrating that the general characteristics of observed CMFs arise naturally in turbulent, self-gravitating flows, and they have also been useful in testing certain specific hypotheses. However, many features that are seen in the simulations are not yet understood in a fundamental sense, and limited numerical resolution may affect some existing results.", "A variety of different numerical models have been used in computational studies of the mass distributions of bound and unbound condensations in turbulent, self-gravitating systems. Most models have adopted an isothermal equation of state: using SPH techniques, Klessen & Burkert (2001), Bonnell, Bate & Vine (2003), Bonnell, Clarke & Bate (2006), and Klessen (2001) analyzed decaying-turbulence models with a variety of power spectra, and Klessen (2001) and Ballesteros-Paredes et al. (2006) analyzed driven-turbulence models. Using grid-based codes in the unmagnetized case, Ballesteros-Paredes et al. (2006) and Padoan et al. (2007) analyzed driven-turbulence models. Using grid-based codes and including magnetic fields, Gammie et al. (2003) analyzed decaying-turbulence models, and V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Rodriguez (1997), Ballesteros-Paredes & Mac Low (2002), Li et al. (2004) and Padoan et al. (2007) analyzed driven-turbulence models. Tilley & Pudritz (2004) analyzed decaying-turbulence unmagnetized models from a grid-based code.", "Other simulations have investigated the effects of nonisothermal equations of state. Li, Klessen & Mac Low (2003) analyzed driven-turbulence SPH simulations that used a range of polytropic indices. Bate, Bonnell & Bromm (2003) and Bate & Bonnell (2005) analyzed the results of SPH decaying-turbulence simulations with a switch from isothermal to T \u221d \u03c10.4 at density 10\u221213 g cm\u22123, to represent the transition from optically-thin to -thick conditions. Jappsen et al. (2005) and Bonnell, Clarke & Bate (2006) investigated the result of switching from a weakly cooling to weakly heating barotropic equation of state at a range of densities n \u223c 104 \u2212 107 cm\u22123, using driven- and decaying-turbulence SPH simulations, respectively.", "The distributions obtained by applying clump-finding techniques to simulation data cubes share many characteristics, generally showing clump mass functions dominated by the low-mass end and tails at high mass that are (marginally) consistent with power-laws having indices similar to the Salpeter value. In detail, however, the mass functions depend on the adopted clump-finding algorithm and on parameters such as density threshold levels and smoothing scales, as well as on physical properties including the Mach number and the history of a system.", "In many simulations that include self-gravity, the high-end slope tends to become shallower over time, as massive objects grow larger. This change in slope may not represent realistic evolution, if massive condensations in fact should undergo fragmentation that the simulations do not follow. Failure to capture fragmentation during collapse could affect results from either grid-based or SPH simulations. Fragmentation is seeded by turbulence, which imposes fluctuations in the density (Sasao 1973). These fluctuations grow as a condensation collapses, and in principle could ultimately result in fragmentation if they become locally Jeans unstable (Hunter 1962, Lynden-Bell 1973). Fluctuations at smaller and smaller mass scales would grow to be highly nonlinear if collapse were to proceed unchecked, so in order to capture this numerically, turbulence at scales below the sonic scale would have to be resolved before collapse commences in a given region. However, it is likely that in reality fragmentation of collapsing high mass condensations is prevented by real physical effects, rather than numerical effects: accretion onto stars formed early in the collapse process heats the surrounding gas significantly, which helps limit further fragmentation (Krumholz 2006), and for condensations in cluster-forming regions, outflows from nearby stars inject small-scale turbulence that may provide support sufficient to prevent rapid localized collapse (Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006; Nakamura & Li 2007; see also Klessen 2001). Until physical processes enter to limit further breakup of massive condensations during their evolution, self-similarity implies they would fragment owing to the same turbulent processes that produced the massive condensations in the first place. This is presumably why the IMF in clusters is the same as that in distributed star formation. Observed dense clumps break up into individual small cores when imaged at high resolution, suggesting that much of the fragmentation is in place prior to collapse. Indeed, the fact that the turnover of the IMF is similar to the Jeans or Bonner-Ebert mass evaluated at the mean turbulent kinetic pressure within GMCs (see Section 3.1.1), P\nkin/k\nB \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 K cm\u22123, suggests that the ambient pressure that sets the typical star's mass is not significantly increased above this level by collapse prior to fragmentation. However, note that the correspondence between the turnover in the IMF and the Bonnor-Ebert mass evaluated at the mean turbulent pressure appears to break down in star clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998) and globular clusters (Paresce & De Marchi 2000), which are believed to have formed at substantially greater pressures (McKee & Tan 2003); the reason for this is not clear.", "A common numerical shortcut to studying cluster formation is to focus on just a single cluster, rather than the whole hierarchical system; this allows the collapse and fragmentation to be better resolved. Models of this kind initiate a simulation at high density with comparable internal turbulent and gravitational energy. However, this approach misses an aspect of the real situation that may be quite important: Self-gravitating massive condensations develop out of nonself-gravitating gas in which pertubations have already been imposed by turbulence. In simulations where the initial kinetic energy does not exceed the gravitational energy, collapse occurs before the turbulence is able to imprint a realistic density structure on the system, such that the subsequent fragmentation may also be unrealistic. In particular, this may lead to massive fragments continuing to grow over time as they capture low-turbulence unstructured gas from their surroundings (competitive accretion; see Section 4.1.2). To obtain a reliable measure of the high-end CMF from numerical models, it will be necessary to perform simulations that include large scales as well as cluster scales, and adequately resolve massive condensations both prior to and during collapse. In addition, physical processes representing the feedback from star formation must be properly included in order to impose realistic limits on fragmentation, coalescence, and accretion after collapse begins.", "Another feature of numerical simulations that is at least qualitatively in accord with observations is the presence of a resolved peak and turnover in the CMF. Exactly how the location of this peak depends on model parameters, however, is not yet well determined. In some simulations, the CMF peak is found to be at masses comparable to the initial Jeans mass of the system (these are primarily low-Mach-number simulations), whereas in other simulations the peak is at much lower mass (these are primarily at high Mach number). The turbulent power spectrum can also affect the position of the CMF peak, and in some simulations the peak is seen to move to larger mass over time. In fact, the position of the peak for an isothermal simulation with a fixed turbulence scaling law must be a function of two dimensionless parameters, the ratio of the total mass in the system to the initial Jeans mass, and the turbulent Mach number on the largest scale. For magnetized simulations, an additional parameter is the ratio of mass to the magnetic critical mass. Although limited dependence on parameters has been explored, a comprehensive and controlled study has not yet been performed. Note that the mass-weighted density in a turbulent system increases as the turbulent Mach number increases (see Section 2.1.4), so that the Jeans mass at the typical (mass-weighted) cloud density decreases as the turbulence level increases, for a given mean (volume-weighted) density and Jeans mass. This probably accounts for why the peak of the CMF was found to be far below the mean Jeans mass in studies with high \n\n, and close to the mean Jeans mass in studies with lower \n\n.", "A recurrent theme in star-formation theory is that the characteristic mass\u2014defined by the peak of the IMF\u2014is the Jeans mass at some preferred density. An upper limit on the preferred density, and hence a lower limit on the fragment mass, is the value at which which the optical depth is unity over a Jeans length; this yields a minimum fragment mass \u22480.007 M\n\u2299 (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976). More recently, Larson (2005) has argued that the thermal coupling of gas to dust at densities above n\nH = nc\n \u2248 106 cm\u22123 results in a shift from weakly decreasing to weakly increasing temperature as a function of density (T \u221d \u03c1-0.27 changes to T \u221d \u03c10.07 at T\nmin \u223c 5 K), and that the Jeans mass \u223c0.3 M\n\u2299 at this inflection point sets the preferred mass scale in the IMF. Part of Larson's argument is that if structure is filamentary, then the filaments will contract radially while \u03b3 < 1; fragmentation into protostellar cores would occur when the filament's central density reaches nc\n and \u03b3 exceeds unity. This argument does not take into account, however, that the mass per unit length of a filament may be determined primarily by the turbulence that originally creates it. In this case, the density nc\n defines a Jeans length (see Equation 20 in Section 2.2), so that the mass scale that emerges would be set by this (fixed) length scale \u223c\u03bb\nJ\n (nc\n) times the (variable) filament mass per unit length. The simulations of Jappsen et al. (2005), which vary the density nc\n at which the temperature minimum occurs, provide qualitative support for Larson's proposal in that the peak of the CMF moves to lower mass as nc\n increases. The scaling of peak mass with nc\n in the simulations is not consistent with the predicted m\npeak \u221d nc\n\n-0.95 scaling, however. In addition, these models did not test dependence on other parameters that may be important, such as the Mach number of the turbulence or the total mass of the system.", "A recent comprehensive proposal to explain the CMF and IMF has been advanced by Padoan & Nordlund (2002, 2004). They argue that because the strength of any given compression (in a shock) is related to its corresponding (preshock) spatial scale \u2113, a power-law turbulence spectrum |v(\u2113)| \u221d \u2113\nq\n will result in a distribution of clump masses that itself follows a power-law. In particular, they propose that the clump mass function produced by turbulence in a magnetized medium will obey \n\n. They further propose that at a given mass m, the fraction of clumps created by turbulence that collapse is obtained by integrating the density PDF down to the density at which that mass would be Jeans unstable, i.e., \u03c1min = \u03c05 \u03c3th\n6/(36m\n2\nG\n3). With this prescription, at high mass the limit of the integral \u03c1min \u2192 0 and they find \u03b1 = 3/(3 \u2212 2q) \u2248 1.4. The position of the CMF peak would depend on the properties of the density PDF; for a log-normal PDF (fM\n; see Equation 5 in Section 2.1.4) with \u03bc\nx\n = 0.5 \u2212 2, the peak mass would be between 0.8 \u2212 0.1 times the Jeans mass at the mean (volume-weighted) density in the cloud.", "The proposal of Padoan & Nordlund is attractive in its overall thrust, and analysis of numerical simulations (Padoan et al. 2007) shows promising consistency with some of the model predictions, such as a steepening of the CMF (larger \u03b1) with steeper velocity power spectrum (larger q). The Padoan & Nordlund proposal, however, also suffers from missing links in its theoretical underpinnings: (a) The effective value of vA\n is defined by Padoan & Nordlund such that the typical compression \u03c1\u2032/\u03c1 in a shock moving at v is a factor v/vA\n (in fact, compression factors depend on the magnetic field direction as well as strength). This effective vA\n is assumed to be independent of scale, and for numerical comparisons with data they adopt a value small compared to the typical value in a GMC of \u223c2 km s\u22121. (b) The argument used to obtain \u03b1 = 3/(3 \u2212 2q) for turbulence-induced clumps assumes that each preshock volume \u21133 maps to a number of postshock volumes of mass m that is independent of \u2113; i.e., \n\n Although this is plausible, other arguments can be made that draw on the scale-free nature of turbulence, yet yield different results. Fleck (1996) and Elmegreen & Falgarone (1996) have argued that in nonself-gravitating turbulence one obtains \n\n. This scaling corresponds to converting a constant fraction of the mass or volume behind every shock into clumps, \n\n, where \u2113\u2032 = \u2113 v\nA/v = \u2113 \u03c1/\u03c1\u2032 is the postshock scale. One might also propose that the filling factor of postshock clumps within the whole volume should be constant, i.e., \n\n. This leads to \n\n, or \u03b1 = 0.75 for q = 1/2. Although the assumption \n\n in the Padoan & Nordlund formulation yields results that are in agreement with measured CMFs, a physical argument is needed to explain why this is the correct choice among several plausible alternatives. In particular, as Padoan & Nordlund's argument for the slope \u03b1 = 3/(3 \u2212 2q) involves only turbulence, why does this value of \u03b1 disagree with the distinctly shallower empirical mass spectrum (\u03b1clump \u223c 0.5; see Section 3.1) of nonself-gravitating clumps in GMCs? (c) The argument Padoan & Nordlund use to obtain a formula for the mass function does not appear to take account of substructure within clumps at a given mass scale, although the presence of substructure is implicit in their picture. In particular, they assume that any region that is unstable by the thermal Jeans criterion will collapse. An implicit requirement for this is that at each density, a contiguous volume containing a mass in excess of the Jeans mass is present. More generally, because hierarchical density structures are clearly important in nature (most cores and stars are clustered), any fundamental theory should identify how this comes about. Given these difficulties, it appears premature to accept the Padoan & Nordlund proposal in its current form, although it is promising as a basis for future development.", "Much of this review focuses on the detailed physical processes of star formation at and below GMC scales. To understand the structure of a given galaxy, however, or the evolution of a population of galaxies over cosmological timescales, often only a very gross characterization of the star-formation processes\u2014such as the overall SFR and the resulting IMF\u2014is adequate. Many empirical studies of disk galaxies characterize the SFR in terms of the number of stars formed per unit time per unit area \u02d9 \u03a3\\*; this is usually reported using either averages over the whole of a galaxy within some outer radius R, or using azimuthal averages over an annulus of width dR to give \u02d9 \u03a3\\* (R). Both of these methods average over regions that may have widely varying SFRs, and the results must be carefully interpreted as strong nonlinearities are involved. Fortunately, with the data becoming available from large-scale galactic mapping surveys (e.g., SONG and SINGS; Helfer et al. 2003; Kennicutt et al. 2003), it will soon be possible to characterize SFRs on scales large compared to individual GMCs but small enough to separately measure, e.g., SFRs for arm and interarm regions.", "More fundamental than \u02d9 \u03a3\\* is the star-formation or gas consumption timescale. This is defined by \n\n, where \u03a3\ng\n is the gas surface density; the second equality assumes that the same area average is used for the total gas mass Mg\n and SFR M\n\\*. The resulting timescale depends on the gas tracer(s) chosen, which determines the range of gas densities included in \u03a3\ng\n. For a chemical species tracing gas in a class of structures denoted by S that have mean internal gas density \u2329\u03c1\u232a\nV\n = \u03c1\nS\n, and total mass MS\n, a convenient fiducial time for comparison to \n\n is the free-fall time obtained by using \u03c1S in Equation 14. The star-formation or gas consumption rate is then", "where the efficiency over a free-fall time is \n\n (see Krumholz & McKee 2005 and Krumholz & Tan 2007; note that they denote this quantity by SFRff,S\n). Note that the star-formation efficiency \u03b5ff,S\n over the free-fall time at the mean local density of structures S differs from the star-formation efficiency \u03b5\nS\n over the mean lifetime of individual structures in class S, which is discussed below. The definition in Equation 38 is particularly useful for describing star formation on local scales within GMCs, in which different molecular transitions trace a relatively limited range of densities, and in which densities can be obtained for individual structures that are spatially resolved and have mass measurements from dust continuum or extinction observations. Because most of the molecular gas, and essentially all star formation, is found within GMCs, the SFR in a region with local surface density in GMCs, \u03a3GMC, is given by \n\n. Here, t\nff,GMC is calculated using the free-fall time within GMCs in a given region. Typical mean densities within GMCs are nH\n \u223c 100 cm\u22123, implying t\nff,GMC \u223c 4 Myr, but this may vary owing to the effects of spiral arms, for example. In clumps or cores within GMCs, \u03c1S can be larger by orders of magnitude compared to \u03c1GMC, yielding a corresponding decrease in t\nff.", "The values of \u03b5ff,S\n are generally low (\u2272 0.01) over a wide range of density tracers (see below), and vary only weakly with \u03c1S. Krumholz & Tan (2006) point out that this suggests that turbulence is limiting star formation, although magnetic regulation is also possible (but probably not on GMC scales, because they appear to be magnetically supercritical\u2014Section 2.3). In the turbulence-regulation picture, the low overall efficiency of star formation on GMC scales (over their own free-fall times) is dictated by the low fraction of gas that concentrates into structures that are sufficiently dense to collapse before being redispersed by turbulence. The weak variation of \u03f5ff,S\n with density follows naturally if the density obeys a log-normal distribution, which is consistent both with numerical simulations of supersonic turbulent flows and with observations of extinction statistics (Sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5). For a log-normal distribution defined by Equation 5, let MS\n be the mass with densities in the range \u03b4 xS\n surrounding \n\n, where \n\n is obtained by dividing total GMC mass by total GMC volume. Then because the SFR M\n\\* is independent of tracer,", "where \n\n is the (mass-weighted) mean within a GMC. With \u03bc\nx\n \u223c 1.5 [corresponding to mass-weighted mean density \n\n, typical of GMCs] and \u03b4 xS\n \u223c 1, \u03b5ff,S\n/\u03b5ff,GMC is between 1.4 and 3.4 for 1 < \u03c1\nS\n/\u2329\u03c1\u232a\nM\n < 10; larger values of \u03bc\nx\n keep \u03b5ff,S\n \u223c \u03b5ff,GMC over a larger range of densities. Approximate constancy of \u03b5ff,S\n over a range of densities implies the approximate relation \nM\n\nS\n \u221d t\nff \u221d \u03c1\nS\n\n-1/2\n from Equation 38. Physically, this is because the equilibrium fraction of mass in a GMC in structures at densities significantly above \n\n is equal to the ratio of the destruction time to the formation time of those structures, t\ndest,S\n/t\nform,S\n. In a turbulent medium, the destruction time is of order the dynamical time of the structure, which decreases with increasing density and decreasing size, whereas the formation time is of order the dynamical time of the GMC for all structures, because the large-scale flow dominates. Note, however, that this discussion does not apply to regions in which self-gravity is strong but turbulence is weak, as occurs in low-mass prestellar cores. In such cores, \u03b5ff rises by an order of magnitude or more to \u223c0.1. Quiescent cores have individual lifetimes of a few t\nff (see Section 3.1.2), and net efficiency of star formation in each core \u223c1/3 owing to the action of protostellar winds (see Sections 3.3.1 and 4.2.6). These structures have evolved to have internal densities (and hence self-gravity) high enough that they can resist destruction by the ambient turbulence. In regions such as forming clusters, where self-gravity causes strong departures from the overall log-normal density distribution in GMCs and high gravity is offset by locally driven turbulence, the relation (Equation 39) would also not be expected to apply.", "Even within a given density regime, there may be significant cloud-to-cloud variations in local conditions such that t\n\nS\\* need not be a universal quantity even for structures observed in a given tracer. Indeed, Mooney & Solomon (1988) showed that for Milky Way GMCs with virial masses (traced in CO) M\nCO = 104 \u2212 5 \u00d7 106\nM\n\u2299 and IR luminosities \n\n, the ratio \nt\nGMC,\\* \u221d M\nCO/L\nIR\n varies over two orders of magnitude and is not correlated with M\nCO. Williams & McKee (1997) came to a similar conclusion from their analysis of OB associations and GMCs in the Galaxy. With a total GMC mass \u2243 109\nM\n\u2299 in the Galaxy and a SFR of several M\n\u2299 year\u22121, the mean value of t\nGMC,\\* \u2248 3 \u00d7 108 years, which translates to \u03b5ff,GMC \u223c 0.01 if \n\n in GMCs. For dense gas clumps in GMCs, however, it appears that conditions are more uniform, such that there is less scatter in t\n\nS\\* for dense gas tracers. In particular, Wu et al. (2005) show that the ratio \n\n measured in Milky Way star-forming regions agrees with the same values measured in high-redshift galaxies (Gao & Solomon 2004), for which there is only one order of magnitude scatter. Wu et al. (2005) estimate a corresponding star-formation timescale of t\nHCN,\\* = 8 \u00d7 107 years. If the typical density of HCN-emitting gas is \u223c105 cm\u22123, the corresponding efficiency per free-fall time is \u03b5ff,HCN \u223c 0.002. Krumholz & Tan (2007) apply slightly different factors to convert total HCN and IR luminosities to gas masses and SFRs, and obtain \u03b5ff,HCN \u223c 0.006. These values of \u03b5ff are small compared to those for individual cores (\u223c0.1), which in clustered regions (where most stars form) have densities \u223c107 cm\u22123 (Ward-Thompson et al. 2007) that are large compared to the densities traced by HCN.", "In spite of the large scatter in t\n\nS\\* from one local region to another (in various density tracers), empirical studies have shown that when averaged over large scales, t\n\ng\\* is correlated with the global properties of gas in a galaxy. The early studies of Schmidt (1959, 1963) sought to characterize the SFR as a power-law (with index >1) in the mean gas density (both volume and surface density); this would then translate to t\n\ng\\* (or t\nff/\u03b5ff) that varies as a negative power of gas density. More recently, following Kennicutt (1989), a number of empirical studies of disk galaxies have identified and explored Kennicutt-Schmidt laws of the form \n\n, for which \nt\n\ng\\* \u221d \u03a3\ng\n\n-p\n. The original study by Kennicutt investigated correlations of \n\n (based on H\u03b1) with the total \u03a3\ng\n (R) (including both atomic and molecular gas); he found an index p = 0.3 for \u03a3\ng\n (R) above a threshold level. Kennicutt (1998) studied correlations of global averages of \n\n with \u03a3\ng\n (again combining atomic and molecular gas). For the whole sample including normal galaxies, the centers of normal galaxies, and starbursts, the fitted index is p = 0.4; the index is slightly larger for just normal spirals. Recent years have seen a number of other studies of the \n\n relationship based on annular averages in galaxies, using H\u03b1, radio continuum, or far-IR to measure star formation, and using either the total gas surface density or just the molecular gas contribution from CO observations (Murgia et al. 2002, Wong & Blitz 2002, Boissier et al. 2003, Heyer et al. 2004, Komugi et al. 2005, Schuster et al. 2007). Most of these studies have found p in the range 0.3 \u2212 0.4, although larger values of p have been obtained in some analyses that include both atomic and molecular gas. For dense gas as traced by HCN, Gao & Solomon (2004) found a linear relationship between the integrated SFR and the total mass of dense gas, i.e., p = 0, based on a sample including both normal galaxies and luminous/ultraluminous IR galaxies. For the same sample, the fitted SFR-gas mass index is p = 0.7 for less dense molecular gas observed in CO lines. All of these fits involve (at least) an order of magnitude scatter about the mean relation. Taken together, these results imply that the amount of dense gas available for star formation increases nonlinearly with the global amount of lower-density gas, but that the SFR in this dense gas is independent of global galactic properties.", "A second approach to characterizing global SFRs introduces the global timescale associated with the galaxy, the orbital period t\norb = 2\u03c0/\u03a9. For grand design spirals, the SFR is expected to be proportional to the rate at which gas passes through spiral arms, because GMCs are expected (and observed) to form rapidly in the high-surface-density gas behind the spiral shock (e.g., Roberts 1969; Kim & Ostriker 2002, 2006; Shetty & Ostriker 2006). Shu (1973) appears to have been the first to propose this idea and showed that it is roughly consistent with observations of star formation in the Galaxy. Wyse (1986) proposed that GMCs, and hence stars, are the result of atomic cloud-cloud collisions at a rate \u221d \u03a3\ng\n\n2 (\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9\np\n), where \u03a9\np\n is the pattern speed. More generally, Wyse & Silk (1989) suggested that the SFR should scale as \n\n. This has been confirmed by Kennicutt (1998); the resulting two forms for the Kennicutt-Schmidt law are", "The fact that there are two forms of the star-formation law implies that there is a correlation between \u03a3\ng\n and \u03a9; Krumholz & McKee (2005) found \u03a9 \u221d \u03a3\ng\n\n0.49 for a sample comprised of both normal and starburst galaxies (Kennicutt 1998, Downes & Solomon 1998). The reason for this correlation is not known at present, but may be related to an overall tendency for velocity dispersions to increase at large surface densities (see below). The corresponding gas consumption time is t\n\ng\\*/t\norb \u2248 10 with t\n\ng\\* evaluated for the entire galaxy and t\norb evaluated at the outer edge of the star formation. Subsequent observations have found t\nmol,\\*/t\norb \u223c 10 \u2212 100 when considering the molecular gas alone (Wong & Blitz 2002, Murgia et al. 2002).", "Because most star formation is observed to take place within bound GMCs, it is useful to introduce f\nGMC \u2261 \u03a3GMC/\u03a3\ng\n, i.e., the fraction of gas that is found in GMCs. The surface densities must be averaged over a region containing a large number of GMCs, because the specific SFR has very large fluctuations; the average can be over a local patch of a galaxy, an azimuthal ring, or an entire galaxy. Equation 38 implies", "This form of the star-formation law is particularly useful if most of the gas is in GMCs, f\nGMC \u2243 1. Because the gas density in the midplane \u03c1\ng\n \u221d \u03a92/GQ\n2 in terms of the Toomre Q parameter, and because \n\n, it follows that \n\n (Krumholz & McKee 2005; see below), which is similar to the orbital time form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law.", "An alternative expression for the SFR follows by noting that if GMCs form from diffuse gas at a rate M\ndiffuse/t\ndiffuse and are destroyed by star formation at a rate M\nGMC/t\nGMC, then f\nGMC = t\nGMC/t\nlc, where t\nlc \u2261 t\ndiffuse + t\nGMC is the life-cycle time for gas in the galaxy. The mean efficiency of star formation in any GMC over its lifetime \nt\nGMC is \u03b5GMC = \u03b5ff,GMC (t\nGMC/t\nff,GMC); in the Milky Way, the observed average value of \u03b5GMC is about 0.05 (e.g., Williams & McKee 1997), corresponding to t\nGMC/t\nff,GMC \u2248 5. The SFR is then", "This equation leads to a simple interpretation of the empirical result \n\n for grand design spirals. In this situation the mean life-cycle time of the gas should be equal to the timescale between successive encounters with spiral arms, t\nlc = (2\u03c0/m)(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9\np\n)\u22121 for an m-armed spiral. If \u03b5GMC varies only modestly with radius, then well inside corotation (which is most of the star-forming disk) the overall SFR should obey \n\n. More generally, consider an arbitrary disk galaxy in which the gas is primarily diffuse, so that the GMC formation time t\ndiffuse is much greater than the GMC destruction time (or lifetime) t\nGMC, and as a result the life-cycle time t\nlc \u2243 t\ndiffuse. The characteristic timescale t\ndiffuse for formation of self-gravitating structures in a disk with surface density \u03a3\ng\n is the 2D Jeans time \nt\n\nJ,2D\n = c\neff/(G\u03a3\ng\n) (Equation 35). (Actual GMC formation timescales differ from t\n\nJ,2D\n due to rotation and disk-thickness effects\u2014see references in Section 3.2.1). Using the definition of the Toomre Q parameter (Equation 32), \n\n, so that from Equation 42, \n\n. Thus, both the diffuse-dominated and GMC-dominated cases yield \n\n, assuming that the efficiency factors are comparable in different regions of a galaxy and from one galaxy to another. Because star formation tends to deplete the gas in any region until Q is near the critical value Q\ncrit \u2243 1.5 (theory: Quirk 1972; observation: Martin & Kennicutt 2001, Wong & Blitz 2002, Murgia et al. 2002, Boissier et al. 2003), this yields the orbital time form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (including the normalization) when \u03b5GMC \u2248 0.05. GMC formation on a timescale \u223ct\n\nJ,2D\n, implying a SFR of \n\n if \u03b5GMC is weakly varying, also yields the other form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law if the effective velocity dispersion increases with surface density according to c\neff \u221d \u03a3\ng\n\n1\u2212p\n. A significant increase in the gas velocity dispersion at small radii, where \u03a3\ng\n is generally larger, has been noted in several galaxies (Kenney, Carlstrom & Young 1993; Sakamoto 1996; Walsh et al. 2002; Lundgren et al. 2004; Schuster et al. 2007), although there is no quantitative theory for this increase.", "A quantitative theory for the galactic SFR must determine the star-formation efficiency (e.g., \u03b5ff,GMC or \u03b5GMC) as well as the corresponding overall rate. [An exception is the theory of Silk (1997), who notes that the porosity of hot gas in a galaxy is determined by the SFR; the SFR can thus be expressed in terms of the porosity, but this remains uncertain.] Tan (2000) proposed that the overall SFR is determined by cloud-cloud collisions, but he set the efficiency based on comparison with observations. Elmegreen (2002, 2003) suggested that the SFR per unit volume is \n\n, where f\ncore is the fraction of gas in dense cores; the value of this was set by comparison with observation. Simulations by Kravtsov (2003), by Li, Mac Low & Klessen (2005a,b; 2006), and by Tasker & Bryan (2006) show that the fraction of high-density gas scales as \u03a3\ng\n\n1.4, but the definition of high-density is arbitrary and the dependence of the SFR on this definition is not known.", "A theory for the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time has been given by Krumholz & McKee (2005); for galaxies in which f\nGMC \u2243 1, this is proposed as a complete theory of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The first three assumptions underlying the theory have been discussed above: They assume that star formation occurs primarily in GMCs, so that the SFR is described by Equation 41, that the density PDF in GMCs is log normal, as inferred from simulations of turbulence in gas that is approximately isothermal (Section 2.1.4), and that the IMF has the standard form. The final assumption is that low-mass stars form in all gas dense enough that the sonic length in the surrounding turbulent gas exceeds the Jeans length (\u03bb\nJ\n < \u2113\ns\n) (Padoan 1995) with an efficiency \u03b5core \u223c 1/2 from the theoretical estimate of Matzner & McKee (2000). The condition that \u03bb\nJ\n < \u2113\ns\n ensures that critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres are not torn apart by turbulence; the corresponding critical density implies that the thermal pressure in the cores matches the turbulent pressure in the environment, \n\n. An important part of this last assumption is that the regions that are dense enough to satisfy \u03bb\nJ\n < \u2113\ns\n have masses large enough to collapse. The normalization for the SFR is based on the simulations of V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen (2003). These assumptions lead to a star-formation efficiency \n\n. Because the virial parameter in GMCs is of order unity and the Mach numbers are somewhat smaller than 100 in regions where they have been observed (and greater than a few 100 even in unresolved starbursts), this corresponds to a typical \u03b5ff,GMC \u223c 0.02. For galaxies in which the gas is not fully molecular, Krumholz & McKee (2005) adopt the phenomenological result for f\nGMC obtained by Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006). They show that the resulting SFR agrees well with Kennicutt's observed relations (Equation 40).", "Finally, we remark that controversy continues to surround the question of what physical process defines the observed outer-disk thresholds R\nth for active star formation. Kennicutt (1989) and Martin & Kennicutt (2001) argue that disk thresholds are set by gravitational stability considerations in shearing, rotating disks, and find a mean value of Q \u2248 1.4 when they adopt a constant value c\neff = 6 km s\u22121 for their sample. Numerical simulations of isothermal gas disks, including both disk thickness effects and the gravity from an active stellar disk, quantitatively support this conclusion (Li, Mac Low & Klessen 2005a; Kim & Ostriker 2007). However, Schaye (2004), building on the suggestion of Elmegreen & Parravano (1994), argues that star-formation thresholds are defined by the condition that the pressure is high enough that a cold component of the atomic ISM can exist. This transition point depends on the UV intensity and metallicity (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2003), but typically corresponds to threshold surface density \u223c3 \u2212 10 M\n\u2299 pc\u22122. Schaye essentially reverses the argument for a Q threshold: He argues that when a significant fraction of the ISM becomes cold, Q drops significantly and gravitational instability ensues. An advantage of this proposal is that it can naturally account for the isolated patches of star formation that occur outside R\nth (Ferguson et al. 1998, Boissier et al. 2006), because star formation occurs wherever the pressure of gas exceeds the critical value. However, though the model gives a necessary condition for star formation, it does not give a sufficient condition: Some of the galaxies in the Martin & Kennicutt (2001) sample have R\nth inside the radius at which the gas becomes molecular, which in turn is inside the radius at which cold atomic gas first appears (see also de Blok & Walter 2006, who find evidence of a cold atomic component even in nonstar-forming regions). In these cases, it is possible that MRI-driven turbulence in the outer disk maintains Q > 1 even when some of the gas is cold (Piontek & Ostriker 2007).", "Star formation is traditionally divided into two parts: Low-mass stars form in a time short compared to the Kelvin-Helmholz time, t\nKH = Gm\n\\*\n2/RL, whereas high-mass stars form in a time \u2273 t\nKH (Kahn 1974). This distinction between low-mass and high-mass protostars is not fully satisfactory, however, because for a sufficiently high accretion rate any protostar would be classified as low-mass. We somewhat arbitrarily divide low- and high-mass stars at a mass of 8 M\n\u2299. Protostars that will form stars with masses significantly below this value have luminosities dominated by accretion, and they form from cores that have masses on the order of the thermal Jeans mass. Protostars above this mass have luminosities that are dominated by nuclear burning unless the accretion rate is very high, and if they form from molecular cores, those cores are significantly above the thermal Jeans mass. Low-mass stars undergo extensive premain-sequence evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, from the point on the birthline, where they cease accreting and are revealed (Stahler 1983; see also Larson 1972), to the main sequence. Here we briefly review the current understanding of how such stars form.", "As discussed above, low-mass stars appear to form from gravitationally bound cores. The timescale for the collapse of these cores determines both the timescale for the formation of a star and the accretion luminosity. Note that the rate of infall onto the star-disk system, \n\n, can differ from the rate of accretion onto the protostar, M\n\\*, because some of the infalling gas can be temporarily stored in the disk. The collapse of such cores and the growth of the resulting protostars has been reviewed by Larson (2003), and we draw on this work here. At the outset of theoretical studies of star formation, it was realized that isothermal cores undergoing gravitational collapse become very centrally concentrated, with a density profile that becomes approximately \u03c1 \u221d r\n\u22122 (Bodenheimer & Sweigart 1968, Larson 1969). Prior to the formation of the protostar, there is a central, thermally supported region of size r \u2243 \u03bb\nJ\n. Collapse of a marginally unstable core begins near the outer radius. The r\n\u22122 density gradient is created as the wave of collapse propagates inward, leaving every scale marginally unstable as the collapse accelerates (cf. Larson 2003). That is, because \u03bb\nJ\n \u223c cs\n/(G\u03c1)1/2 (Equation 20), a sphere that is marginally unstable at each scale, r \u223c \u03bb\nJ\n, will have \u03c1 \u223c cs\n\n2/(Gr\n2) when the protostar is first formed; the corresponding infall rate is", "where the gravitational mass and radius are defined in Equation 13 and \u03d5in is a numerical factor that is typically \u2273 1. (When the effect of protostellar outflows is included, the infall rate is reduced by a factor \u03b5core < 1.) Although this result was first derived for an isothermal sphere, Stahler, Shu & Taam (1980) emphasize that it should apply approximately to the collapse of any cloud that is initially in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium, with \ncs\n\n2 \u2192 c\neff\n2 = cs\n\n2 + vA\n\n2 + v\nturb\n2\n including the effects of magnetic fields and turbulence as well as thermal pressure; Shu, Adams & Lizano (1987) suggest that c\neff \u2272 2cs\n, however. This infall rate explicitly depends only on the sound speed, but it implicitly depends on the density of the core: because the core was assumed to be initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, Equation 43 is equivalent to \n\n.", "There are two limiting cases for the gravitational collapse of an isothermal sphere. In the first case, originally considered by Larson (1969) and Penston (1969) and extended by Hunter (1977), one begins with a static cloud of constant density and follows the formation of the r\n\u22122 density profile. At the time when the protostar first forms (i.e., when the central density reaches infinity in this idealized calculation), the collapse is highly dynamic, with an infall velocity of 3.3cs\n. The infall rate onto the star is large, rapidly increasing from \n\n at the moment of protostar formation to \n\n. In the physically unrealistic case of an infinite, uniform medium, the accretion rate would remain at this high value; in practice, the accretion rate rapidly declines after the formation of a point mass (see below). In the opposite case, considered by Shu (1977), one assumes that the evolution to the r\n\u22122 density profile is quasi-static (most likely owing to the effects of magnetic fields\u2014see below), so that the infall velocities are negligible at the moment of protostar formation. The resulting initial configuration is the SIS, which is an unstable hydrostatic equilibrium. The collapse is initiated at the center, and the point at which the gas begins to fall inward propagates outward at the sound speed (the expansion wave): R\new = cs t. This solution is therefore termed an inside-out collapse. For r \u2265 R\new, the density is that of a SIS, \u03c1 = cs\n\n2/(2\u03c0 Gr\n2); for r < R\new, the gas accelerates until it reaches free fall, with v = \u2212 (2Gm\n\\*/r)1/2 and \u03c10 \u221d r\n\u22123/2. The generalized post-core-formation solutions of Hunter (1977) share the same density and velocity scalings at small radii. The infall rate for Shu's expansion wave solution is constant in time,", "The total mass inside the expansion wave at time t is \n\n, so that about half this mass is in the protostar (i.e., f\new \u2261 m\n\\*/m\new \u2243 1/2). Larson (2003) describes the Larson-Penston-Hunter and Shu solutions as fast and slow collapse, respectively, and suggests that reality is somewhere in between. A general discussion of the family of self-similar, isothermal collapse solutions has been given by Whitworth & Summers (1985).", "Observations suggest that the cores that form low-mass stars initially have density profiles that approximate those of Bonnor-Ebert spheres (Section 3.1). Foster & Chevalier (1993) used time-dependent simulations to follow the collapse of such spheres under the assumption that support is by thermal pressure alone. They found that the collapse of the innermost, nearly uniform, part of a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere (i.e., one with a center-to-edge density contrast of 14.1) approaches, but does not reach, the Larson-Penston solution prior to and at the time of core formation. Shortly thereafter, the infall rate begins to decline; there is no phase of constant infall for a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However, a sphere that is initially in an unstable equilibrium with a larger center-to-edge density contrast has an extended (outer) region in which the density scales as r\n\u22122. In this case the infall rate starts off as in the critical Bonnor-Ebert case and then declines to the constant value for an SIS. The infall rate eventually decreases below the SIS value when a rarefaction wave from the boundary of the cloud reaches the origin (see Vorobyov & Basu 2005a). Numerical simulations of gravitational collapse in an unmagnetized, turbulent medium show that the initial spike and subsequent decline of the infall rate are typical (Schmeja & Klessen 2004).", "Most of the theoretical work (except for simulations) on low-mass star formation has neglected the role of turbulence in the core. This is generally a valid approximation for low-mass cores, but it becomes increasingly inaccurate as the core mass increases. When turbulence is included, it is generally in the microturbulent approximation. Bonazzola et al. (1987, 1992) treated the turbulent pressure as being scale-dependent, and suggested that turbulence could stabilize GMCs while allowing smaller scales to undergo gravitational collapse. Lizano & Shu (1989) introduced a phenomenological model for turbulence, a logotropic equation of state (Section 2.2), to treat the contraction of the core. Myers & Fuller (1992) and Caselli & Myers (1995) modeled cores that are supported in part by turbulent motions with a density distribution that is the sum of an r\n-r power-law for a thermal core and a flatter power-law for the turbulent envelope. Turbulent cores also can be approximately modeled as polytropes with \u03b3\np\n < 1 (Section 2.2), and when cores collapse, the adiabatic index \u03b3 can exceed unity (McKee & Zweibel 1995; V\u00e1zquez-Semadeni, Canto & Lizano 1998). Ogino, Tomisako & Nakamuro (1999) generalized the Foster & Chevalier (1993) calculation and found that both the peak infall rate and the rate of decline of the infall rate are increased for \u03b3 = \u03b3\np\n > 1. McLaughlin & Pudritz (1997) generalized the Shu solution to singular polytropic and singular logatropic spheres. They showed that the expansion wave accelerates in time as R\new \u221d t\n2\u2212\u03b3\np\n\n and the infall rate increases as \n\n (logatropes correspond to \u03b3\np\n \u2192 0). The ratio of the mass in the protostar to that engulfed by the expansion wave is f\new \u2243 1/2,1/6, and 1/33 for \u03b3\np\n = 1,2/3, and a logatrope, respectively. The infall rate for a singular polytropic sphere can also be expressed as \n\n, where t\nff is the free-fall time measured at the initial density of the gas just accreting onto the star and \u03d5\\* \u2243 1.62 \u2212 0.96/(2 \u2212 \u03b3\np\n) (McKee & Tan 2002; this is valid for 0 < \u03b3\np\n < 1.2). Inside-out collapse solutions for clouds that are initially contracting and that have \u03b3 \u2260 \u03b3\np\n have been developed by Fatuzzo, Adams & Myers (2004). For clouds that are supported in part by turbulence, the decay of the turbulence can initiate the collapse of the core (Myers & Lazarian 1998).", "In the innermost regions of the collapsing core, the opacity eventually becomes large enough that the gas switches from approximately isothermal behavior to adiabatic behavior. The initial calculations were carried out by Larson (1969), and recent calculations include those by Masunaga, Miyama & Inutsuka (1998), Masunaga & Inutsuka (2000), and Wuchterl & Tscharnuter (2003); all assume spherical symmetry. The gas begins to become adiabatic at a density \u03c1 \u223c 10\u221213 g cm\u22123. The first core forms when the gas becomes hot enough to stop the collapse, and an accretion shock forms at a radius \u223c 5 AU and with an enclosed mass \u223c0.05 M\n\u2299. Once the gas is hot enough to dissociate the molecular hydrogen, a second collapse ensues and the protostar is formed. When opacity effects are included, the maximum infall rate is limited to about 13cs\n\n3/G (Larson 2003), and the average infall rate over the time required to assemble 80% of the final stellar mass is about 1.5\u20133 times the SIS value (Wuchterl & Tscharnuter 2003).", "The two classical problems of star formation are the angular momentum problem and the magnetic flux problem: A star has far less angular momentum and magnetic flux than an equivalent mass in the ISM. Magnetic fields effectively remove angular momentum so long as the contraction of the core is sub-Alfv\u00e9nic and the neutral and ionized components of the infalling gas are reasonably well coupled (e.g., Mestel 1985, Mouschovias 1987). Once either of these conditions breaks down, the gas will collapse with (near-)constant specific angular momentum, j = \u03d6 v\n\u03d5, where \u03d6 is the cylindrical radius, provided the transport of angular momentum by turbulence and gravitational torques is unimportant. For collapse at constant j, a disk will form with a radius", "where \n\n is the Keplerian velocity, m\n\\*d\n is the mass of the star and disk (assumed to be equal to the initial mass M[\u03d60]), \u03b2rot is the rotational energy parameter defined in Equation 30, and \u03d6\n0\n and \u03a9\n0\n are the initial cylindrical radius and angular velocity. In the collapse to a disk, the radius shrinks by a factor 3 \u03b2rot. Note that if the rotational velocity is proportional to the velocity dispersion, as might be expected for a cloud supported by turbulent motions (Burkert & Bodenheimer 2000), then \u03b2rot (\u03d60) is constant (Goodman et al. 1993), and the disk radius is a fixed fraction of the initial radius. However, clouds supported primarily by thermal pressure are generally assumed to be in uniform rotation. Recall that Goodman et al. (1993) found that cores typically have \u03b2rot (R\ncore) \u223c 0.02.", "As in the nonrotating case, two limits for rotating collapse have received the greatest attention. These studies have generally assumed isothermality and have focused on inviscid, axisymmetric flow, although the latter conditions are likely to be violated in real disks, as discussed in Section 4.2 below. If the core initially has constant density and is rotating slowly, then it collapses to a disk that evolves to a configuration with a singular surface density profile, \u03a3 \u221d \u03d6\u22121 (Norman, Wilson & Barton 1980; Narita, Hayashi & Miyama 1984). The self-similar solution for the collapse of a rotating disk has been obtained by Saigo & Hanawa (1998), who pointed out that this solution is the analog of the Larson-Penston-Hunter solution for nonrotating collapse (i.e., it includes the time after the formation of the central singularity in \u03a3). A quasi-equilibrium disk with a radius Rd\n \u2243 j\n2/Gm\n\\*d\n (Equation 45) grows after formation of the central singularity. Because both M(\u03d6) and j scale as \u03d62 in the inner part of the initial spherical cloud, it follows that j \u221d M(\u03d60). Angular momentum is conserved during disk formation, so when a mass M(\u03d60) = m\n\\*d\n has collapsed into the disk, Rd\n \u221d j\n2/m\n\\*d\n \u221d m\n\\*d\n, which grows linearly in time in the isothermal case. Note also that because \u03a3 \u221d \u03d6\u22121 in the disk, it follows that after disk formation M and therefore j \u221d \u03d6; as a result, the rotational velocity in the disk is constant, independent of \u03d6. The infall rate into the central disk is about (3 \u2212 11)cs\n\n3/G, depending on the angular momentum; this is significantly less than that for the nonrotating Larson-Penston-Hunter solution (Saigo & Hanawa 1998). In this solution the gas outside the equilbrium disk is dynamically contracting and is assumed to be itself in a thin disk. Numerical calculations indicate that relaxation of the thin disk approximation increases the accretion rate by about a factor of two for the case they considered.", "Alternatively, if the core settles into a centrally concentrated, spherical, quasi-equilibrium state prior to collapse, a slow, inside-out collapse ensues. The density distribution of the supersonically infalling gas in the vicinity of the disk has been determined by Ulrich (1976) and by Cassen & Moosman (1981) under the assumptions that the mass is dominated by the central protostar and that the gas is spherically symmetric far from the protostar. The outer radius of the disk is given by Equation 45, but the disk is far from Keplerian\u2014there is a large inward velocity that leads to a dynamically contracting outer disk and quasi-equilibrium inner disk (Stahler et al. 1994). This solution for the inner part of the infall can be joined smoothly to the solution for the collapse of an SIS (Terebey, Shu & Cassen 1984). More generally, if the cloud initially has a power-law density profile (\u03c1 \u221d r\n\u2212k\u03c1) with k\n\u03c1 > 1, then it is straightforward to show that, for \u03a90 = const, the disk radius is \n\n. For the collapse of a slowly rotating SIS (k\n\u03c1 = 2), this equation implies that the disk radius varies as Rd\n \u221d m\n\\*d\n\n3 \u221d t\n3 (Cassen & Moosman 1981). This rapid increase in disk radius with time is based on the assumption that the cloud can evolve to a rigidly rotating SIS. Subsequent work (described below) shows that even when magnetic fields are included, this condition is difficult to realize, and Rd\n tends to increase only linearly with time.", "\n\nEffects of magnetic fields.\n\u2003\n Poloidal magnetic fields prevent gravitational collapse when they are sufficiently strong (subcritical cores), and they inhibit contraction otherwise (supercritical cores), as discussed in Section 2.2. Magnetic tension acts to dilute the force of gravity. In nonrotating disks, this effect can be modeled approximately by adopting an effective gravitational constant (Basu 1997, Nakamura & Hanawa 1997, Shu & Li 1997), G\neff = (1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03a6\n\u22122)G, where \u03bc\u03a6 \u2261 M/M\n\u03a6 (Section 2.2) is assumed to be independent of r and must be greater than unity for gravitationally bound clouds; this equation is exact if the disk is also thin (Shu & Li 1997). As a result, the mass of a thin, nonrotating, isothermal, magnetically supercritical disk in equilibrium is M(r) = [1/(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03a6\n\u22122)]2cs\n\n2\nr/G (Li & Shu 1996), which can be much larger than in the absence of magnetic support. If such a disk is initially in static equilibrium (which is difficult to arrange), the infall rate resulting from an inside-out collapse has \u03d5in = 1/(1 \u2212 \u03bc\u03a6\n\u22122) in Equation 43 to within about 5% (Li & Shu 1997, Allen, Shu & Li 2003).", "Mouschovias and his students have carried out an extensive set of calculations on the evolution of a magnetized disk assuming that the disk is thin and axisymmetric, which reduces the calculation to one spatial dimension. They followed the evolution from a subcritical initial state to supercritical collapse under the influence of ambipolar diffusion (Fiedler & Mouschovias 1993), including the effects of charged grains (Ciolek & Mouschovias 1994, 1996, 1998) and rotation (Basu & Mouschovias 1994, 1995a,b). In these calculations, the magnetic field has a characteristic hour-glass shape in which the field is normal to the disk and flares above and below it; observations that are consistent with this geometry have been obtained recently at a resolution of 700 AU (Girart, Rao & Marrone 2006). Galli & Shu (1993a,b) show that even if the magnetized core began with a spherical shape, it would collapse to a disk, which they term a pseudodisk as it is not rotationally supported. The calculations of Mouschovias and his students cited above typically began in a very subcritical state, with \u03bc\u03a6 \u2243 0.25, and stopped when the central density reached 109.5 cm\u22123, which is about the point at which the central regions are expected to become opaque and nonisothermal. They found that thermal pressure exerts an outward force \u224330% of that due to gravity, whereas centrifugal accelerations are negligible in this phase of evolution. The central part of the core undergoes an extended phase of evolution until it becomes supercritical, at which point the contraction accelerates and the mass-to-flux ratio increases more slowly.", "\nBasu (1997) has given a semianalytic treatment of these results. He showed that the surface density profile in the inner core is \n\n, where \u03a3\nc\n is the central surface density and \nR(t) = 2cs\n\n2/G\u03a3\nc\n (t) is the radius of the region in which thermal pressure is sufficiently strong to maintain an approximately constant density (Narita, Hayashi & Miyama 1984 found a similar result for rotating collapse without a magnetic field). The supercritical core has a radius R\ncrit obtained by setting the central surface density equal to twice the critical value [\u03a3\nc\n = \u03bc\u03a6\nB\n0/(2\u03c0 G\n1/2) with \u03bc\u03d5 = 2, where B\n0 is the initial field strength in the core]. He showed that the slow increase in the mass-to-flux ratio, \u03bc\u03a6 \u221d \u03a30.05, results in a significant reduction in magnetic support at high densities. The density profile in the inner part of the disk (r \u226a R\ncrit) has k\n\u03c1 \u2243 2, but the increasing relative importance of magnetic forces in the outer regions cause it to flatten out so that the mean value in the entire core is k\n\u03c1 \u2243 1.6. Basu found that the rotational velocity is independent of r, just as Saigo & Hanawa (1998) did for the nonmagnetic case. Extending the problem to include the time after protostar formation, Contopoulos, Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl (1998) obtained a similarity solution to the nonrotating collapse problem with ambipolar diffusion and found an infall rate \n\n at the time of protostar formation. Two-dimensional numerical calculations have confirmed this result and have shown that the infall rate subsequently drops by somewhat less than a factor of 2 (Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl 1998).", "\nShu, Li & Allen (2004) have considered very different initial conditions, in which a uniform field threads a SIS. Because the flux-to-mass ratio is zero at the origin and increases outward, magnetic effects are negligible at the center and become important only at a characteristic length scale R\nch = \u03c0 c\n2\n\ns\n/G\n1/2\nB, corresponding to the condition that MG\n \u223c M\n\u03a6 (a similar length scale arises in studies of collapse with ambipolar diffusion, as may be inferred from Basu & Mouschovias 1995b). They follow the collapse under the assumption that the flux is frozen to the gas and find that the infall rate declines after the expansion wave reaches R\nch; this is analogous to the result of Ciolek & Mouschovias (1995), who found a similar result for the case of collapse with ambipolar diffusion when the expansion wave reached a point at which the ambipolar diffusion was inhibited by photoionization. The initial conditions assumed by Shu, Li & Allen (2004) lead to a poloidal field that decreases inward, whereas calculations that start from nonsingular initial conditions and include ambipolar diffusion find that the poloidal field strongly increases inward.", "A full similarity solution for the evolution of the collapsing core after it has fallen into a thin disk and a protostar has formed at the center, including rotation, magnetic fields, and ambipolar diffusion, has been obtained by Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl (2002). They assumed that the gas is in a thin disk with a constant rotational velocity (see above); how this assumption would be affected by turbulence, which would thicken the disk and transport angular momentum, is unclear. The infalling gas goes through two shocks, a C-shock (which has a structure dominated by ambipolar diffusion\u2014e.g., Draine & McKee 1993) and a shock at the outer edge of the centrifugally supported disk. When the protostar reaches 1 M\n\u2299, the C-shock is at about 103 AU and the centrifugal shock is at about 102 AU, consistent with data on T Tauri systems (see Section 4.2.1 below). Within the self-similar framework, they found that magnetic braking can be adequate to maintain accretion onto the central protostar; in this case there would be no need for internal disk stresses to drive accretion. The infall rate in their fiducial case is 4.7cs\n\n3/G; for a gas at 10 K, this corresponds to a star-formation time \n\n years. Their solution does not include an outflow, but they show how one might be included and estimate that this could reduce the accretion rate by a factor of \u22723. In sum, based on the theoretical work to date, it is clear that the infall rate is proportional to c\neff\n3/G, where c\neff is an effective sound speed (Stahler, Shu & Taam 1980), but the value of the coefficient and its time dependence have yet to be determined in realistic cases.", "The magnetic flux problem in star formation is that stars have very large values for the mass-to-flux ratio (\u03bc\u03a6 \u223c 104 \u2212 105 in magnetic stars, \u223c 108 in the Sun\u2014Nakano 1983), whereas they form from gas with \u03bc\u03a6 \u223c 1. This problem does not have an adequate solution yet, but it appears that it must be resolved in part on scales \u2272 1000 AU and in part on smaller (\u223cAU) scales. Detailed calculations of the ionization state of the infalling and accreting gas show that the ionization becomes low enough that the field decouples from the gas at densities of order 1010.5 \u2212 1011.5 cm\u22123 (Nishi, Nakano & Umebayashi 1991; Desch & Mouschovias 2001; Nakano, Nishi & Umebayashi 2002); decoupling occurs at a somewhat lower density after the formation of the central protostar, owing to the stronger gravitational force (Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl 1998). Li & McKee (1996) showed that once the field decouples from the gas, magnetic flux accumulates in the accretion disk as the gas flows through the field and onto the protostar. The pressure associated with this field is strong enough to drive a C-shock (which has a structure dominated by ambipolar diffusion) into the infalling gas. The radius of the shock is predicted to be several thousand AU at the end of the infall phase of a 1-M\n\u2299 star; inside the shock, the field is approximately uniform (except close to the star) and the gas settles into an infalling, dense disk that they identified with the outer disk observed in HL Tau (Hayashi, Ohashi & Miyama 1993).", "These results have been confirmed and improved upon by Contopoulos, Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl (1998), Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl (1998), and Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl (2002). Tassis & Mouschovias (2005) have carried out 2D axisymmetric calculations with careful attention to the evolution of the ionization and find that the location of the shock oscillates, leading to fluctuations in the accretion rate; it is important to determine if this effect persists in a full 3D simulation. Tassis & Mouschovias (2007a,b,c) find that the magnetic field in the central region (r \u2272 10 AU) is about 0.1 G at the end of their calculation, when the central star has a mass \u223c0.01 M\n\u2299; this is at the low end of the fields inferred in the early solar nebula from meteorites, which are in the range of 0.1 = 10 G (Morfill, Spruit & Levy 1993). They show that ohmic dissipation becomes as important as ambipolar diffusion at densities \u2273 1012.5 cm\u22123, but it does not affect the total magnetic flux. However, even though these processes significantly reduce the field within a few AU of the protostar, they are not sufficient to reduce the magnetic flux in the protostar to the observed value (Nakano & Umebayashi 1986, Li & McKee 1996, Ciolek & K\u00f6nigl 1998, Li 1998, Tassis & Mouschovias 2005). It is possible that turbulent diffusion (Li & McKee 1996) or magnetic reconnection (Mestel & Strittmatter 1967, Galli & Shu 1993b) plays a role in further reducing the magnetic flux. Reconnection alters the topology of the field and can displace the region in which the flux crosses the forming or accreting disk. However, reconnection cannot actually destroy flux (a common misconception), because at sufficient distance from the protostar the plasma is a good conductor and the total flux inside this conductor must be conserved. At the present time, the solution to the magnetic flux problem remains incomplete.", "As remarked above (Section 4.1.1), magnetic fields are thought to play a critical role in solving the classical angular momentum problem by means of magnetic braking (Mestel 1985, Mouschovias 1987). Indeed, magnetic braking when the field is frozen to the matter is so effective that Allen, Li & Shu (2003) and Galli et al. (2006) have argued that magnetic reconnection is required to reduce the field and therefore the braking enough that a Keplerian disk can form. The infall solution of Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl (2002), which includes ambipolar diffusion, and the numerical simulations of Hujeirat et al. (2000), which include both turbulence and ambipolar diffusion, suggest that Keplerian disks can form without reconnection, but nonetheless indicate that predicting the evolution of the specific angular momentum of the infalling gas is a complex problem. However, it is not clear that any of these theoretical models are consistent with the observations of Ohashi et al. (1997), which show that the specific angular momentum in gas associated with several protostars in Taurus is constant for 10\u22123 pc < r < 0.03 pc.", "Numerical simulations, as opposed to numerical integration of the underlying partial differential equations, are required to study core collapse in 2D or 3D without additional assumptions (such as self-similarity or a thin-disk condition). A critical review of numerical simulations of low-mass star formation is given by Klein et al. (2007). To date, such simulations have not included ambipolar diffusion, nor have they simultaneously included radiative transfer and magnetic fields; most simulations have also stopped prior to the formation of the protostar. A prediction of these simulations is that a slow (v \u223c cs\n \u223c 0.2 km s\u22121) outflow should occur at large radii (\u223c103 AU; Tomisaka 1998, 2002; Banerjee & Pudritz 2006). These authors suggest that this outflow is related to the observed bipolar outflows, but Allen, Li & Shu (2003) disagree. In any case, this large-scale outflow could be important in setting the outer boundary conditions for the jets and higher-velocity outflows that are observed (see Sections 4.2.4, 4.2.5).", "Once a protostar star has formed by gravitational collapse of a core, it can continue to grow by gravitational accretion from the ambient medium. Most treatments of this process do not distinguish between the gas that accretes directly onto the star and the gas that first falls onto the disk. Hoyle & Lyttleton (1939) first developed the theory of accretion by a moving point mass, and Bondi (1952) extended the theory to the case in which the star is at rest in a medium of finite temperature. Today, gravitational accretion by a stationary object is generally referred to as Bondi accretion, whereas that by a moving object is referred to as Bondi-Hoyle accretion. If the density and sound speed far from the star are \u03c1 and cs\n, respectively, and the star is moving at a velocity \n\n through the ambient medium, then the characteristic radius from which the star accretes is", "The accretion rate is", "where \u03d5BH is a number of order unity that fluctuates somewhat due to instabilities in the flow (Ruffert & Arnett 1994).", "There are a number of assumptions that go into this result: (a) The mass inside R\nBH is dominated by the mass of the star\u2014i.e., the self-gravity of the accreting gas is negligible. One can show that", "so that this condition is equivalent to requiring that the stellar mass be small compared to the Bonnor-Ebert mass (Equation 15) in the ambient medium (for \n\n). (b) The tidal gravitational field is negligible; when it is not, R\nBH is replaced by the tidal radius (Bonnell et al. 2001a). (c) The magnetic field is negligible. Based on dimensional scalings, a rough approximation for the effect of a magnetic field on the accretion rate would be to make the replacement v\n0 \u2192 (v\n0\n2 + vA\n\n2)1/2. (d) The ambient gas is moving at a uniform velocity. In fact, gas in molecular clouds is generally supersonically turbulent, so that an accreting star experiences large fluctuations in both the density and velocity of the accreting material. Krumholz, McKee & Klein (2006) showed that the mean accretion rate in a turbulent medium is given by Equation 47 with \u03c1 equal to the mean density, \n\n replaced by \n\n, and \n\n, provided that the 3D Mach number \n\n of the turbulence is large compared to \n\n and compared to unity (they verified this result for \n\n and \n\n). This result was derived from simulations of isothermal gas, but it should be approximately valid for other equations of state also. The median accretion rate is significantly less than the mean, however.", "The dominant paradigm for star formation is gravitational collapse, but an alternative is that stars (or at least relatively massive stars) are formed primarily by the capture and subsequent accretion of matter that is initially unbound to the star (Zinnecker 1982, Bonnell et al. 1997). Because protostars compete for gas from a common reservoir, this process is termed \u201ccompetitive accretion.\u201d The simulations of Bonnell et al. (1997) show that a few of the fragments gain most of the mass; these are the ones that reside primarily in the central regions of the clump and have the highest accretion rates. Because gravitational accretion scales as m\n\\*\n2, initial differences in protostellar masses are amplified. This process has the potential of producing the IMF, and it also naturally leads to massive stars being centrally concentrated in clusters, as observed (Bonnell et al. 2001b). A key issue for competitive accretion is, What is the level of turbulence in the ambient medium? There is general agreement that competitive accretion is ineffective if the medium has turbulent energy comparable to gravitational energy, with \u03b1vir order unity (see Equation 11), whereas it is effective if the turbulence is sufficiently weak, \u03b1vir \u226a 1 (Bonnell et al. 2001a; Krumholz, McKee & Klein 2005a; magnetic fields, which tend to suppress accretion, have not been considered yet). Bonnell and his collaborators (Bonnell & Bate 2006 and references therein) argue that the gas throughout star-forming clumps has a very low turbulent velocity so that protostars in clusters can accrete efficiently. However, Krumholz, McKee & Klein (2005a) argue that stellar feedback and the cascade of turbulence from larger scales ensure that the star-forming clumps are sufficiently turbulent to be approximately virialized and to therefore have negligible competitive accretion. Analysis of data from several star-forming clumps shows that stars in these clumps could grow by only 0.1 \u2212 1% in a dynamical time; this is far too small to be significant. The timescale for the formation of star clusters is an important discriminant between these models: Star clusters form in about 2t\nff if turbulence is allowed to decay (Bonnell, Bate & Vine 2003), whereas it can take significantly longer if turbulence is maintained (Bonnell, Bate & Vine 2003). The observational evidence discussed by Tan, Krumholz & McKee (2006) and Krumholz & Tan (2007) favors the longer formation time. This controversy can be resolved through more detailed observations of gas motions in star-forming clumps and through more realistic simulations that allow for the evolution of the turbulent density fluctuations as the clump forms and evolves to a star-forming state, and that incorporate stellar feedback.", "The growth of protostars can be inferred through observations of the mass distribution surrounding the protostar, the velocity distribution of this circumstellar gas, and the nonstellar radiative flux. The mass and/or temperature distribution on both small and large spatial scales can be inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the continuum. Protostellar SEDs are conventionally divided into four classes, which are believed to represent an evolutionary progression [Myers et al. (1987) divided sources into two classes; Lada (1987) introduced Classes I\u2013III; Adams, Lada & Shu (1987) discussed a similar classification; and Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (1993) introduced Class 0]. Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (2000) have summarized the classification scheme:", "These classes can also be defined in terms of the bolometric temperature, which is the temperature of a black body with the same mean frequency as the SED of the YSO (Myers & Ladd 1993).", "Unfortunately, the geometry of the source can confound this classification scheme (e.g., Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000). It is well recognized that a given source can appear as a Class II source at small or moderate inclination angles (so that the central star is visible) and as a Class I source at large inclination angles (so that the central source is obscured by the disk). A similar ambiguity can involve Class 0 sources if the protostellar envelope is flattened owing to the presence of a large-scale magnetic field or contains cavities created by protostellar jets. White et al. (2007) summarize the observational evidence that many of the properties of Class I and Class II sources are similar, which is consistent with inclination effects confusing the evolutionary interpretation of the SEDs. This ambiguity can be alleviated by radio or submillimeter observations of the envelopes, which yield masses that are independent of inclination; Motte & Andr\u00e9 (2001) find that about 40% of the sources in Taurus that are classified as Class I on the basis of their SEDs have envelope masses <0.1 M\n\u2299 and are thus unlikely to be true protostars. More sophisticated modeling of the SEDs can also clarify the evolutionary sequence of YSOs; for example, Robitaille et al. (2006) have calculated 2 \u00d7 105 model SEDs, including the effects of outflow cavities, that can be automatically compared with observed SEDs to infer the properties of the source. Counts of sources at different evolutionary stages together with an estimate for the age for one of the stages allows one to infer the lifetimes for all the stages. Typical estimates for the ages are 1 \u2212 2 \u00d7 105 years for Class I sources and 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 104 years for Class 0 sources (Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson & Barsony 2000).", "There is a significant discrepancy between the protostellar accretion rates that are observed and those that are expected, resulting in the so-called luminosity problem (Kenyon et al. 1990). The luminosity due to accretion onto the star is", "where f\nacc is the fraction of the gravitational potential energy released by accretion, the rest being carried off in a wind or absorbed by the star (e.g., Ostriker & Shu 1995), 0.25 M\n\u2299 is the typical mass of a protostar (i.e., half the mass of a typical star), and 2.5 R\n\u2299 is the corresponding radius (Stahler 1988). There are two main ways to estimate the expected average accretion rate, \n\n. (a) Because both the mass ejected from the disk and the mass stored in the disk are generally a small fraction of the stellar mass (see Section 4.2), the average accretion rate \n\n should be comparable to the infall rate \n\n. Theoretically, for T = 10 K, this is \n\n year\u22121 (Equations 43, 44). If the fraction of the core mass that goes into the star is \u03b5core \u2243 1/3 (Matzner & McKee 2000; Alves, Lombardi & Lada 2007), and if the envelope infall rate is that expected from rotating, magnetized collapse (\u03d5in \u2243 5\u2014Krasnopolsky & K\u00f6nigl 2002), then the infall rate is \n\n year\u22121. Observationally, the properties of the envelopes around Class I objects inferred from the SEDs give similar infall rates (Kenyon, Calvet & Hartmann 1993), so this estimate for \u03f5core \u03d5in cannot be too far off. (b) A direct estimate of the average accretion rate is that forming a 0.5 M\n\u2299 star in 2 \u00d7 105 years, the estimated upper limit on the duration of the embedded stage, requires \n\n year\u22121, comparable to the estimated infall rate. The average luminosity corresponding to this accretion rate is \u2329L\u232a \u2243 8 L\n\u2299. The problem is that the observed median luminosity of the bona fide Class I sources (i.e., those with significant molecular envelopes) in Taurus is about 0.5 \u2212 1 L\n\u2299 (White & Hillenbrand 2004 and Motte & Andr\u00e9 2001, respectively), almost an order of magnitude smaller. The problem is significantly worse than this, however, as only a small fraction of the luminosity is due to accretion (Muzerolle, Hartmann & Calvet 1998); White & Hillenbrand (2004) find that the fraction is about 25%. The clearest statement of the luminosity problem is as an accretion rate problem: The observed accretion rates in Class I protostars are 1\u20132 orders of magnitude smaller than those needed to form a star during the lifetime of a Class I object.", "\nKenyon et al. (1990) suggested two solutions to this problem. One solution is that significant accretion continues into the T Tauri stage, but this appears to be ruled out by the fact that such stars accrete very slowly (10\u22128\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121; see Section 4.2.1), and there is not a significant disk or envelope mass reservoir that they can draw on for episodic accretion. The other solution is that most of the accretion occurs in the embedded stage, but it is episodic, so that the median accretion rate is much smaller than the mean. They suggested that the high accretion-rate stage of protostellar accretion could correspond to FU Orionis objects, which are very luminous (typically 200 \u2212 800 L\n\u2299\u2014Hartmann & Kenyon 1996) and have have accretion rates \u223c10\u22124\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121. Such outbursts could be due to thermal instability (Bell & Lin 1994, Bell et al. 1995), although this would only affect the inner disk, and hence the outburst would be limited in duration and total mass accreted; or to gravitational instability in the disk (see Section 4.2.2 and Vorobyov & Basu 2005b, 2006). However, Hartmann & Kenyon (1996) estimate that the observed FU Ori objects can account for only about 5 \u2212 20% of the mass of stars forming in the solar vicinity; this discrepancy has not disappeared in the intervening decade. Recent observational studies of the central stars in Class I sources differ on their evolutionary status: White & Hillenbrand (2004) argue that the Class I protostars are similar to TTSs and are thus past the main protostellar accretion phase, whereas Doppmann et al. (2005) come to the opposite conclusion. If protostars are close to their final mass by the time they become Class I sources, then they must gain most of their mass in the Class 0 stage. In this case the luminosity problem remains, albeit in a milder form: The mean accretion rate required to form a 0.5 M\n\u2299 star in 3 \u00d7 104 years (the estimated upper limit on the lifetime of a Class 0 source\u2014Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson & Barsony 2000) is 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22125\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121, corresponding to \n\n; by contrast, the median luminosity of the Class 0 sources listed by Andr\u00e9, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (2000) is about 10 L\n\u2299. This luminosity problem could be alleviated if a significant fraction of the accretion energy is carried off by the powerful protostellar outflows that accompany these sources, so that f\nacc \u2272 1/2. However, accounting for a value of the infall rate as high as the inferred accretion rate onto the star remains a theoretical challenge: The magnetized collapse models discussed above give infall rates of a few \u00d7 10\u22126\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121 (for \u03b5core \u223c 1/3), significantly less than required. A resolution of the luminosity problem thus remains elusive.", "Spectroscopic observations using molecular transitions can give both the mass and velocity distributions in collapsing cores (Myers, Evans & Ohashi 2000), but to date the spatial resolution of these data is generally \u2273 100 AU. Evidence for infall in unresolved cores is provided by the infall asymmetry (Lucas 1976, Leung & Brown 1977, Myers et al. 1996): optically thick, infalling gas in which the excitation temperature rises toward the center produces a characteristic line profile in which the blue wing is stronger than the red wing. Observations of samples of starless cores (Lee, Myers & Tafalla 1999, 2001), Class 0 sources (Gregersen et al. 1997), and Class I sources (Gregersen et al. 2000) show a blue excess [(blue asymmetries\u2014red asymmetries)/(number of sources)] of about 0.25 \u2212 0.35, indicating that many of these sources are undergoing collapse (Myers, Evans & Ohashi 2000). Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to carry out unambiguous observational tests of the theoretical models for protostellar accretion. Furuya, Kitamura & Shinnaga (2006) mapped the infall in a young Class 0 source and found reasonably good agreement with the Larson-Penston-Hunter solution (\u03d5in \u2243 20 in Equation 43); this source appears to be very young, because for r > 100 AU there is no evidence for the \u03c1 \u221d r\n\u22123/2 density profile expected for accretion onto a protostar of significant mass. Tafalla et al. (1998) and Lee, Myers & Tafalla (2001) found that infall is more extended than expected in inside-out collapse models, although this infall may reflect the formation of small clusters rather than individual stars. They also found that the infall velocity is faster than expected in standard ambipolar diffusion models; however, the velocities are consistent with the collapse of magnetically supercritical cores (Ciolek & Basu 2000). A potentially important result is that Ohashi et al. (1997) found that cores in Taurus are in solid body rotation on scales \u2273 0.03 pc but conserve angular momentum on smaller scales. The physical significance of this length scale could be inferred by determining its value in other molecular clouds.", "\n\nBrown dwarfs.\n\u2003\n Because brown dwarfs represent the low-mass extreme of star formation, they can shed light on the earliest stages of star formation. As a result of a great deal of observational work over the past decade, it has been established that most brown dwarfs form by the same mechanism as most stars (Luhman et al. 2007, Whitworth et al. 2007): the IMF, velocity and spatial distributions at birth, multiplicity, accretion rates, circumstellar disks, and outflows are all continuous extensions of those for hydrogen-burning stars. This is to be expected, as stars near the H-burning limit at 0.075 M\n\u2299 reach their final mass long before hydrogen burning commences. Following Whitworth et al. (2007) and Chabrier et al. (2007), we shall assume that brown dwarfs form by gravitational instability on a dynamical timescale, and that their composition reflects that of the ambient ISM. By contrast, planets are believed to form in circumstellar disks and to have an elemental composition with an excess of heavy elements. With these definitions, the observational distinction between giant planets with masses \u2273 MJ\n and small brown dwarfs is somewhat indistinct, but should eventually be amenable to spectroscopic determination (Chabrier et al. 2007). The lower limit to the mass of a brown dwarf is set by the condition that the star becomes opaque to the radiation it emits while undergoing gravitational collapse (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976); including helium, this is about 4 \u00d7 10\u22123\nM\n\u2299 \u2243 4 MJ\n\n (Whitworth et al. 2007). The smallest brown dwarfs detected to date have masses \u223c(0.01 \u2212 0.02) M\n\u2299 (Luhman et al. 2007).", "In order for a brown dwarf to form, its mass must exceed the Bonnor-Ebert mass, even if it forms via shock compression (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1978); the pressure at the surface of the core that forms the brown dwarf must therefore be \n\n K cm\u22123. Assuming that brown dwarfs form by turbulent fragmentation, Padoan & Nordlund (2004) show that such pressures can be reached in a large enough fraction of the mass of the cluster IC348 to account for the brown dwarfs observed there. This model is based on the asumption that the gas is isothermal and that as a result the density PDF is a log-normal distribution (Equation 5). The remaining mystery is, Why is the IMF of brown dwarfs relatively constant (at least to within a factor of two) when their numbers are exponentially sensitive to the mean of the log-normal distribution, which depends on the Mach number at the largest scale in the cloud? This is part of the larger mystery as to why the IMF appears to be universal, but in the brown dwarf regime the exponential sensitivity to ambient conditions potentially offers an opportunity to determine how ambient conditions affect the IMF.", "\nWhitworth et al. (2007) review a number of other mechanisms for brown dwarf formation that could contribute in some cases:", "\n\nBinaries.\n\u2003\n Stars are roughly evenly divided between those that are in multiple systems (mainly binaries) and those that are single. For stars of mass \u223c1 M\n\u2299, Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) found that the fraction of stellar systems that are multiple\u2014i.e., the ratio of the total number of binaries, triples, etc. divided by the total number of systems, including single stars\u2014is f\nmult = 0.58. Multiplicity declines for smaller masses, and Reid & Gizis (1997) find f\nmult \u2243 0.3 for stars in the Solar Neighborhood, which are primarily M stars. Lada (2006) finds a similar result when one averages over the entire IMF: The majority of stellar systems (as opposed to the majority of stars) are single. The fraction of singles is smaller at birth, however: Higher-order multiples (triples, etc.) are often dynamically unstable, and in dense environments collisions among stellar systems can disrupt wide binaries (Kroupa, Petr & McCaughrean 1999). Observations summarized by Duch\u00eane et al. (2007) show that the multiplicity among TTSs in low-density associations such as Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus and among Class I sources in high-density regions such as L1641 in Orion is about twice as high as among field stars. In dense star-forming regions like Orion, however, this excess multiplicity is soon erased\u2014for example, the multiplicity in the Orion Nebula Cluster (which is older than L1641) is the same as in the field. This introduces a complication in comparing the CMF with the IMF (Section 3.3): On average, cores produce more than one star, and the properties of the resulting stellar systems evolve with time. This is not a major complication, however, because each core typically produces only 2\u20133 stars (Goodwin & Kroupa 2005), and the distribution of secondary masses in typical binaries appears to follow the field star IMF (Goodwin et al. 2007). It should be noted that the multiplicity of the stars is imprinted on their spatial distribution: Larson (1995) found a clear break in the density of companions in Taurus at about 0.04 pc, separating binaries and multiple stars from larger scale clusters.", "Binaries raise two important issues in the theory of star formation: What is the role of binaries in reducing the angular momentum inherited by protostars? What determines how molecular cores fragment? Binaries do not appear to be effective in taking up the angular momentum of the initial core: Fisher (2004) has shown that turbulent molecular cores must lose 99\u201399.9% of their initial angular momentum in order to qualitatively account for a number of features of the binary population with periods \u2273 103 days. This angular momentum loss is generally assumed to be due to magnetic braking (Section 4.1.1), but Jappsen & Klessen (2004) suggest that gravitational torques can also contribute. Binaries can remove angular momentum on small scales by ejecting a companion, which hardens the remaining binary. However, Goodwin & Kroupa (2005) point out two limitations on this process: (a) it tends to create equal mass binaries, which are not common for typical stars, and (b) it would create a population of single stars significantly larger than observed.", "There is an extensive literature on the fragmentation of protostellar cores into binary and multiple protostars that is reviewed by Bodenheimer et al. (2000), Duch\u00eane et al. (2007), and Goodwin et al. (2007). Simulations of fragmentation are very challenging because of the enormous range of scales involved, and it does not appear that any of the simulations carried out to date have enough resolution and enough physics (i.e., including MHD and radiative transfer) to adequately address the problem (Klein et al. 2007). In particular, a number of simulations produce 5\u201310 fragments per core, whereas observations show that most cores produce only 2\u20133 fragments (Goodwin & Kroupa 2005).", "Because protostellar cores are rotating, collapse with conservation of angular momentum results in the formation of a centrifugally-supported disk (Section 4.1.1). Observed sizes and rotation parameters for low-mass dense cores predict disk sizes \u2272 1000 AU, consistent with high-resolution submillimeter continuum observations that indicate average (dust) disk sizes around TTSs of \u2248200 AU (Andrews & Williams 2006); similar results are obtained using millimeter interferometry (Kitamura et al. 2002). The disks around T Tauri disks extend inward to \u223c0.04 AU based on modeling of observed CO vibrational emission lines (Najita et al. 2006); these inner radii are smaller than the inner disk radii inferred for dust disks, presumably because the dust sublimates. The initial sizes of circumstellar disks are more difficult to determine, because protostellar systems in the earliest stages (prior to the T Tauri stage) are still enshrouded in dusty envelopes that emit at similar wavelengths to the disk; in a few cases where the inner envelope emission can be spatially separated out, disk sizes appear similar (e.g., J\u00f8rgensen et al. 2005).", "Masses of protostellar disks are estimated using the continuum flux in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The first disk mass estimates for TTSs were obtained from observations of the total flux at a single millimeter wavelength under the assumption of optically thin emission (e.g., Beckwith et al. 1990), but subject to an uncertainty in the overall normalization owing to the uncertainty in the dust opacity coefficient [because M\ndisk \u221d F\n\u03bd/(\u03bd2 \u03ba\u03bd)]. Multiwavelength (submillimeter to centimeter) observations suggest that the dust opacity law \u03ba\u03bd \u221d \u03bd\u03b2 has a distinctly shallower slope \u03b2 than holds for dust in the diffuse ISM, presumably owing to grain growth (e.g., Beckwith & Sargent 1991; Beckwith, Henning & Nakagawa 2000). Interpretation of the multiwavelength flux data as implying a change in \u03b2 is complicated by the fact that some of the short-wavelength emission can be optically thick (which yields F\n\u03bd \u221d \u03bd2 independent of \u03b2 for a disk that is optically thick at all \u03bd). However, spatially resolved observations can be combined with modeling to correct for optically thick contributions varying with \u03bd and R, with the resulting median being \u03b2 \u2272 1 (e.g., Natta et al. 2007, Andrews & Williams 2007, Lommen et al. 2007), suggesting that the largest grains are in fact centimeter-size pebbles (e.g., Wilner et al. 2005, Rodmann et al. 2006). Total disk masses for T Tauri systems are estimated to be in the range \u223c10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22121\nM\n\u2299 with a median near 0.005 M\n\u2299 from submillimeter observations (e.g., Andrews & Williams 2005), but these may severely underestimate the true masses if a large fraction of the grains have grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes and thus emit only weakly in the submillimeter (Hartmann et al. 2006, Natta et al. 2007). Determining the distribution of mass within disks is difficult because submillimeter emission is likely optically thick in the inner regions, whereas at longer wavelengths there is insufficient resolution to probe the inner-disk regions (Andrews & Williams 2007). Finally, we note that disk mass determinations assume a cosmic ratio of gas to dust; at late evolutionary stages, photoevaporation may preferentially remove gas, and planet formation may preferentially remove dust.", "The thermal structure of protostellar disks is likely quite complex. Disks can be heated both externally via irradiation from the central star, and internally from dissipation and thermalization of orbital kinetic energy as the gas accretes (Calvet et al. 1991, Chiang & Goldreich 1997). As a consequence, the vertical temperature distribution depends on details of the system and can have a local minimum at intermediate altitude (D\u2019Alessio et al. 1998). The vertical temperature distribution together with its dependence on radius must be self-consistently calculated, because the flaring of the disk surface affects the amount of radiation intercepted from the central star (see discussion and references in Dullemond et al. 2007). In addition, gas and dust temperatures may differ in the upper atmospheres where the densities are low and stellar X rays strongly heat the gas (Najita et al. 2006). Quite sophisticated radial-vertical radiative models (including grain growth and settling) have been developed that agree well with observed SEDs from micrometer to millimeter wavelengths [see e.g., Dullemond & Dominik (2004), D\u2019Alessio et al. (2006) and references therein]. The IR emission signatures, including PAH features at 3 \u2212 13 \u03bc and edge-on silhouette images, as well as scattered-light/polarization observations in optical and near-IR frequencies, indicate that although some grains have grown to large sizes, small grains still remain in disk atmospheres (see references and discussion in Dullemond et al. 2007 and Natta et al. 2007).", "Disk lifetimes are inferred based on stellar ages combined with IR and millimeter/submillimeter emission signatures, which are sensitive to warm dust. Multi-wavelength Spitzer observations of the nearby star-forming cluster IC 348 (Lada et al. 2006) show that for \u223c70% of stars, disks have become optically thin in the IR (implying inner disks R \u2272 20 AU have been removed) within the 2- to 3-Myr age of the system; disk fractions are slightly higher (\u223c50%) for Solar-type stars than in those of higher or lower mass; observations of other clusters are consistent with these results (Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006a). L-band observations of disk frequencies in clusters spanning a range of ages (Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001) suggests that overall disk lifetimes are \u22486 Myr. Even in the 10-Myr-old cluster NCG 7160, however, a few percent of stars still show IR signatures of disks (Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006a), and disk lifetimes appear to be inversely correlated with the mass of the star (Hernandez et al. 2007). Signatures (or their absence) of dusty disk emission are also well correlated with evidence (or lack) of accretion in gaseous emission line profiles (see below) in systems at a range of ages, indicating that gas and dust disks have similar lifetimes (Jayawardhana et al. 2006, Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006b). Andrews & Williams (2005) found, for a large sample of YSOs in Taurus-Auriga, that in general those systems with near-IR signatures of inner disks also have submillimeter signatures of outer disks, and vice versa; they conclude that inner and outer disk lifetimes agree within 105 years.", "Accretion in YSO systems is studied using a variety of diagnostics (see e.g., Calvet, Hartmann & Strom (2000)), including continuum veiling of photospheric absorption lines and optical emission lines, which are respectively believed to arise from hot (shocked) gas on the stellar surface and from gas that is falling onto the star along magnetic flux tubes. Gullbring et al. (1998) measured a median accretion rate for million-year-old TTSs of \u223c10\u22128\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121, and White & Ghez (2001) found similar accretion rates for the primaries in T Tauri binary systems. A recent compilation of observations (White & Basri 2003, Muzerolle et al. 2003, Calvet et al. 2004) shows an approximate dependence of the accretion rate on stellar mass \n\n, although with considerable scatter (Muzerolle et al. 2005). This scaling of the accretion rate with stellar mass is potentially explained by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the ambient molecular cloud (Padoan et al. 2005). However, such a model accounts only for the infall rate onto the star-disk system, not the disk accretion rate; these need not agree. In addition, it does not account for the accretion seen in TTSs outside molecular clouds (Hartmann et al. 2006). During their embedded stages (a few \u00d7 105 years), low-mass stars have typical disk accretion rates similar to or slightly larger than those of T\\_Tauri Stars (TTSs) (White et al. 2007). As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the infall rates from protostellar envelopes typically exceed disk accretion rates by a factor of 10\u2013100, so it is possible that mass is stored in the disk and released intermittently, in brief but prodigious accretion events similar to FU Ori outbursts (Kenyon et al. 1990, Hartmann & Kenyon 1996).", "For high-mass protostars, observations suggest that there are at least two classes of disks (Cesaroni et al. 2007). In moderate-luminosity sources corresponding to B stars (L\u2272 a few \u00d7104\nL\n\u2299), the disks appear to be Keplerian, with masses significantly less than the stellar mass and timescales for mass transfer \u223c105 years. In luminous sources (L \u2273 105\nL\n\u2299), the disks are large (4 \u2212 30 \u00d7 103 AU) and massive (60 \u2212 500 M\n\u2299). Consistent with the discussion in Sections 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, the disks are observed to be non-Keplerian on these large scales. To distinguish these structures from the disks observed around B stars, Cesaroni (2005) terms them toroids. The inferred infall rates in these disks are of order 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 \u2212 2 \u00d7 10\u22122\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121, corresponding to mass transfer timescales of order 104 years (Zhang 2005). In view of their large size and mass, they may be circumcluster structures rather than circumstellar ones. Indeed, one of the best studied luminous sources, G10.8\u20130.4, is inferred to have an embedded cluster of stars with a total mass \u223c300 M\n\u2299 (Sollins et al. 2005). Simulations of the formation of an individual massive star in a turbulent medium give a disk size \u223c103 AU, significantly smaller than the size of the toroids (Krumholz, Klein & McKee 2005). To date, no disks have been observed in the luminous sources on scales \u2272103 AU. Most likely, this is because of the observational difficulties in observing such disks; it should be borne in mind, however, that there is no direct evidence that these sources are in fact protostellar. Including disks around both B stars and the toroids around luminous sources, Zhang (2005) finds that the mass infall rate in the disks scales as \n\n, although there are substantial uncertainties in the data for the luminous sources.", "The most fundamental theoretical question about YSO disks is what makes them accrete; although many mechanisms have been investigated, the problem is still open. In large part this is because the accretion process depends on a complicated interplay of MHD, radiative transfer, chemistry, and even solid state physics. The MHD is itself nonideal, because the medium is partially ionized, and in addition self-gravity is important in many circumstances. Self-gravity effects and the level of electrical conductivity are very sensitive to thermal and ionization properties, which in turn are determined by chemistry and radiative transfer (including X-rays and cosmic rays), and the latter are strongly affected by grain properties that evolve in time due to sticking and fragmentation. Compounding the difficulty imposed by the interactions among the physical processes involved is the lack of exact knowledge of initial and boundary conditions: How does collapse of the rotating protostellar core shape the distribution of mass in the disk, starting from the initial disk-building stage and continuing (although at a reduced rate) with later infall? Finally, there is the difficulty imposed by the huge dynamic range in space and time; disks themselves span a range of \u223c104 in radius and 106 in orbital period, while the small aspect ratio H/R \u226a 1 (where H is the scale height of the disk) implies a further extension in dynamic range is required for numerical models that resolve the disk interior.", "Processes proposed to transport angular momentum in YSO disks generally fall into one of three categories: purely hydrodynamic mechanisms, MHD mechanisms, and self-gravitating mechanisms (e.g., see the reviews of Stone et al. 2000 and Gammie & Johnson 2005). Within the past decade, it has become possible to investigate mechanisms in each class using high-resolution time-dependent numerical simulations in two and three dimensions, in which the stresses that produce transport are explicitly obtained as spatial correlations of component velocities, magnetic fields, and the density and pressure for a self-consistent flow. Prior to the computational revolution that made these investigations possible, and continuing into the present for modeling in which large radial domains and long-term evolution is required, many studies have made use of the so-called alpha prescription for angular momentum transport. In this approach (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974, Pringle 1981), a stress tensor is defined that yields an effective viscous torque between adjacent rings in a differentially rotating disk. On dimensional grounds, and using the fact that the shear stress should be zero for solid-body rotation, this stress can be written as \n\n; i.e., the effective kinematic viscosity is taken to obey \n\n. This effective viscosity Ansatz makes it possible to study disk evolution with a purely hydrodynamic, 1D model. Although the \u03b1-model approach has been essential to progress on modeling disk observables, it is limited in its ability to capture realistic dynamics because the coefficient is arbitrary (and usually taken as spatially constant) and the adopted functional form for T\n\nR,\u03d5, though dimensionally correct, may not reproduce the true behavior of nonlinear, time-dependent, 3D flows (e.g., see Ogilvie 2003; Pessah, Chan & Psaltis 2007, submitted). For a Keplerian disk, \u2212d ln \u03a9/d ln R = 3/2 and in steady state the mass accretion rate is \n\n; i.e., the ratio of radial inflow speed to orbital speed is \n\n. Observed accretion rates of TTSs require \u03b1 \u223c10\u22122 (Hartmann et al. 1998). Because the effective viscosity is equal to a characteristic length scale for angular momentum transport times at characteristic transport speed, the empirically determined viscosity corresponds to a few percent of the value that would be obtained if transport occurred at sonic speeds over distances comparable to the scale height of the disk.", "Using the infall rate scaling of Equation 43, the ratio of the disk accretion rate to the infall rate is:", "where we have assumed that the gravitational potential is dominated by the star. The outer-disk temperature is not much larger than the temperature in the core, and R/H \u223c 10 for the outer disk, so the disk accretion rate is much lower than the infall rate unless M\ndisk/m\n\\* or \u03b1/\u03d5in exceeds \u223c0.1. This is not the case for TTSs, but during the embedded stages the disk masses may be larger, and (possibly as a consequence of larger M\ndisk and self-gravity; see below) the values of \u03b1 may be larger as well.", "\n\nHydrodynamic mechanisms.\n\u2003\n The simplest transport mechanisms would be purely hydrodynamic. Turbulence generated either through convection (owing to vertical or radial entropy gradients), through shear-driven hydrodynamic instabilities, or through external agents (such as time-dependent, clumpy infall) could in principle develop velocity field correlations \u2329\u03c1 \u03b4 vR\n \u03b4 v\u03d5\u232a of the correct sign (>0) to transport angular momentum outward. Ryu & Goodman (1992) showed, however, that convective modes tend to transport angular momentum inward, rather than outward, and Stone & Balbus (1996) confirmed from 3D numerical simulations with turbulence driven by convection that angular momentum transport is inward. Convection driven by radial entropy gradients also transports angular momentum inward and is generally stabilized by differential rotation (Johnson & Gammie 2006).", "Several analytic studies have shown that purely hydrodynamic disturbances in Keplerian-shear disks are able to experience large transient growth (Chagelishvili et al. 2003; Klahr 2004; Umurhan & Regev 2004; Johnson & Gammie 2005a; Afshordi, Mukhopadhyay & Narayan 2005), especially for the case of 2D (i.e., z-independent) columnar structures. Conceivably, transient growth of sheared waves could lead to self-sustained turbulence with outward transport of angular momentum, if new leading wavelets could be continually reseeded in the flow via nonlinear interactions (Lithwick 2007, submitted). Although transient growth is indeed seen in 2D (R \u2212 \u03d5) numerical simulations, it is subject to secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that limits the growth when \n\n (Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006). The turbulence that results also appears to decay without creating leading wavelets to complete the feedback loop, but this may be due to limited numerical resolution. Other numerical evidence, together with analytic arguments, suggest that nonlinear shear-driven hydrodynamic instabilities are unable to maintain turbulence for Rayleigh-stable rotational profiles (in which angular momentum increases outward, i.e., \u03ba2/\u03a92 = 2d ln (\u03a9 R\n2)/d ln R > 0) (Balbus, Hawley & Stone 1996; Hawley, Balbus & Winters 1999). Because simulations using the same numerical methods show that analogous Cartesian shear flows do exhibit nonlinear instability, rotating systems are presumably stabilized by Coriolis forces and the epicyclic motion that results. One potential concern is that the effective Reynolds numbers of numerical experiments are too low to realize nonlinear shear-driven instabilities and self-sustained turbulence. Very recently, however, Ji et al. (2006) reported from laboratory experiments at Reynolds numbers up to millions that hydrodynamic flows with Keplerian-like rotation profiles in fact show extremely low levels of angular momentum transport, corresponding to \u03b1 < 10\u22126.", "Although it may be difficult to grow perturbations from instabilities in uniform Keplerian disks, it is still possible that disks are born with large internal perturbations, and that ongoing infall at all radii can continually resupply them. Simulations have shown that 2D disks with nonuniform vorticity tend to develop large-scale, persistent vortices that are able to transport angular momentum outward (Umurhan & Regev 2004, Johnson & Gammie 2005b). Three-dimensional simulations, however, show that vortex columns tend to be destroyed (Barranco & Marcus 2005; Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006). Although off-midplane vortices can be long-lived (Barranco & Marcus 2005), the angular momentum transport in 3D simulations is an order of magnitude lower than for the 2D case (Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006) and secularly decays. Further investigation of this process is needed, and it is particularly important to assess whether vorticity can be injected at a high enough rate to maintain the effective levels of \u03b1 \u223c10\u22122 needed to explain observed TTS accretion.", "\n\nMHD mechanisms.\n\u2003\n The introduction of magnetic fields considerably alters the dynamics of circumstellar disks. The realization by Balbus & Hawley (1991) that weakly or moderately magnetized, differentially rotating disks are subject to a powerful local instability\u2014now generically referred to as the MRI\u2014revolutionized the theory of accreting systems. Early axisymmetric numerical simulations showed robust growth and development of the so-called channel solution (Hawley & Balbus 1991), whereas 3D numerical simimulations showed emergence of quasi-steady state saturated turbulence (Brandenburg et al. 1995; Hawley, Gammie & Balbus 1995; Matsumoto & Tajima 1995) in which the angular momentum transport is outward and is dominated by the magnetic stresses \u2329 \u2212 BR B\n\u03d5/(4\u03c0)\u232a. Much effort has been devoted to exploring the MRI as a basic mechanism driving accretion in a variety of systems; Balbus & Hawley (1998) and Balbus (2003) summarize many of these developments. The effective value of \u03b1 depends on the mean vertical magnetic flux, which presumably evolves over long timescales, and can easily exceed 0.1 (e.g., Hawley, Gammie & Balbus 1996; Stone et al. 1996; Sano et al. 2004).", "Although MRI almost certainly plays an important role in driving accretion in YSO systems, it is not a magic bullet. The difficulty is that substantial portions of these disks may have ionization too low for MRI to be effective (Gammie 1996; Jin 1996; Glassgold, Najita & Igea 1997; D\u2019Alessio et al. 1998; Igea & Glassgold 1999), creating a \u201cdead zone.\u201d A critical review of the requirements for MRI to develop in partially ionized disks is given in Gammie & Johnson (2005); Ohmic diffusion appears to be the main limiting effect, with the saturated-state value of \u03b1 dropping when vA,z\n\n2/\u03b7 \u03a9 \u2272 1 where \u03b7 is the resistivity (Sano & Stone 2002; Turner, Sano & Dziourkevitch 2006). In the very innermost parts of YSO disks (R \u2272 0.1 AU), alkali metals are collisionally ionized where the stellar irradiation maintains the temperature above \u223c 2000 K, so MRI can operate. In the outer disk (beyond several AU), and in the mid-disk's surface layers, column densities are low enough (\u03a3 < \u03a3\na\n \u223c 100 g cm\u22122) that X rays or cosmic rays can penetrate the disk to ionize it. (For comparison, the surface density in the minimum Solar nebula is \u03a3 = 1700(R/AU)-1.5 g cm\u22122\u2014Hayashi, Nakazawa & Nakagawa 1985.) Unfortunately, the extent of the MRI-active region in the outer disk is very sensitive to the presence and size distribution of dust particles; if small grains are present and well-mixed, the active region is quite limited, whereas it can become very large if all the dust is incorporated in large particles or settles to the midplane (Sano et al. 2000; Fromang, Terquem & Balbus 2002; Desch 2004; Salmeron & Wardle 2005). Even if ionizing radiation is limited to the surface layers by high total disk columns, if small grains are absent (an extreme assumption) the gas-phase recombination rate is low enough such that turbulence with rapid vertical mixing can maintain non-negligible ionization in the interior. Turner, Sano & Dziourkevitch (2007) have shown, using direct numerical simulations, that the dead zone can be effectively eliminated in this (optimistic) scenario; though the very center of the disk at 1 AU is not unstable to MRI, the interior is still conductive enough that magnetic fields generated nearer the surface can induce accretion in the midplane.", "One of the possible consequences of spatially varying conductivity in disks is that the accretion rate will, in general, vary with radius. If only a surface layer \u03a3\na\n is active, in the sense of being sufficiently conductive to support MRI with effective viscosity coefficient \u03b1\na\n, then the accretion rate in that layer will be \n\n. Because \u03a3\na\n varies slowly with radius (for the case of external ionization) while the combination \u03c3th\n2/\u03a9 tends to decrease inward, dropout from the accretion flow can accumulate within the dead zone that is sandwiched between active layers (Gammie 1996). If the dead zone remains completely inactive, then matter will build up until it becomes dynamically unstable and begins to transport angular momentum by gravitational stresses (see below), potentially leading to transient bursts of accretion (Gammie 1996; Armitage, Livio & Pringle 2001).", "Finally, we note that MHD winds (see Section 4.2.5) may remove angular momentum from disks, driving the matter remaining in the disk to accrete in order to maintain centrifugal balance. The angular momentum deficit is tranferred to the disk by magnetic stresses, so that only the matter that is well-coupled to magnetic fields will be affected. Thus, the above considerations regarding ionization also apply to wind-driven accretion.", "\n\nSelf-gravitational mechanisms.\n\u2003\n Accretion disks that have sufficiently small values of the Toomre parameter \n\n are subject to nonlinear growth of density perturbations via the swing amplifier (see Sections 2.2, 3.2.1). Then, in addition to hydrodynamic Reynolds stresses \u2329\u03c1 vR v\n\u03d5\u232a and MHD Maxwell stresses \u2329BR B\n\u03d5/(4\u03c0)\u232a, gravitational Newton stresses \u2329gR g\n\u03d5/(4\u03c0 G)\u232a (where g = \u2212 \u2207 \u03a6) also contribute to the radial transport of angular momentum. Gammie (2001) showed that if the disk is in equilibrium such that cooling removes the energy dissipated by mass accretion at a rate per unit area \u03a3\u03c3th\n2/[(\u03b3 \u2212 1)t\ncool], then \u03b1\u22121 = (9/4)\u03b3 (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u03a9 t\ncool\n, where \u03b3 is the effective (2D) adiabatic index (which takes into account vertical degrees of freedom, and depends on the 3D index and degree of self-gravity). Numerical simulations with simple cooling prescriptions (constant t\ncool \u03a9) show that the disk can settle into a self-regulated state with Q near unity (Gammie 2001, Lodato & Rice 2004, Mej\u00eda et al. 2005, Rice, Lodato & Armitage 2005), provided that t\ncool \u03a9 is not too small (in which case the disk fragments). For disks that are not externally illuminated, Johnson & Gammie (2003) performed 2D simulations with realistic opacities (and a one-zone vertical radiative transfer approximation for cooling), and found that the transition between fragmentation and nonfragmentation lies in the range t\ncool \u03a9 = 1 \u2212 10. The corresponding \u03a3 at the transition point increases with \u03a9, such that outer disks are the most active regions gravitationally. Values of \u03b1 up to 0.5 are possible, with the equilibrium condition prediction satisfied down to t\ncool \u03a9 \u2248 3 and \u03b1 \u2248 0.1. Using a 3D model of a 0.07 M\n\u2299 disk with realistic cooling, Boley et al. (2006) find a value of \u03b1 \u223c0.01 over a large range of radii >20 AU.", "In view of the limitations on \u03b1, Cesaroni et al. (2007) argue that accretion rates are limited to values substantially smaller than inferred for the formation of high-mass stars (Section 4.3.1). However, Krumholz, Klein & McKee (2007) find that disks around high-mass protostars can transfer mass inward at the same rate that it falls in. They carried out simulations of high-mass star formation in a turbulent medium and included radiative transfer rather than prescribing the heating and cooling rates. They found that large amplitude m = 1 modes develop that give effective values of \u03b1 of order unity, in qualitative agreement with the isothermal disk results of Laughlin & Bodenheimer (1994).", "Disks that are illuminated sufficiently strongly will have the temperature set by the external radiation field rather than internal dissipation of energy. In that case, whether self-gravity is important or not depends essentially on the amount of matter present in a given region. Where the surface density is high enough so that Q is near but not below the critical value \u2248 1.4, self-gravitational stresses will be appreciable but not so large as to cause fragmentation. Analytic estimates assuming steady state and accretion heating as well as irradiation (Matzner & Levin 2005, Rafikov 2005) indicate that fragmentation is only possible in the outer portions of disks, although more massive disks, around more massive stars, are more subject to fragmentation (Kratter & Matzner 2006). At temperatures comparable to those in observed systems, disks with masses \u2273 0.1 M\n\u2299 are candidates for having significant mass transport owing to self-gravitating torques (Mayer et al. 2004). Thus, self-gravity is likely to be particularly important during the embedded stage of disk evolution, when disk masses are the largest. Vorobyov & Basu (2005b, 2006) propose, based on results of 2D simulations, that recurrent bursts of accretion owing to self-gravity are likely to develop during the early stages of protostellar evolution. A number of other results from models of self-gravitating disk evolution (with an emphasis on criteria for planet formation through fragmentation) are presented in the review of Durisen et al. (2007).", "Although a large proportion of the mass in the disk ultimately accretes onto the star, conservation of angular momentum requires that some of the matter be left behind. MHD winds during the main lifetime of the disk remove some of this material (see Section 4.2.5). What remains is either incorporated into planets or removed by photoevaporation. Although planet formation is inextricably coupled to disk evolution, recent developments in this exciting\u2014and rapidly expanding\u2014field are too extensive to summarize here. A number of excellent recent reviews appear in Protostars and Planets V.", "Disks can be irradiated by UV and X-ray photons originating either in their own central stars or in other nearby, luminous stars (see e.g., reviews of Hollenbach, Yorke & Johnstone 2000 and Dullemond et al. 2007). Extreme UV (EUV) radiation penetrates only the surface layer of the disk, where it heats the gas to \u223c104 K (the ionization and heating depth is determined by the Str\u00f6mgren condition); FUV penetrates deeper into the disk (where densities are higher), but heats gas to only a few 100 K (Hollenbach et al. 1994; Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998). The characteristic radial scale in the disk for a thermally driven wind is the gravitational radius \nrg\n = Gm\n\\* \u03bc/(kT), where T is the temperature at the base of the flow. Pressure gradients enable flows to emerge down to (0.1 \u2212 0.2)rg\n (Begelman, McKee & Shields 1983; Adams et al. 2004; Font et al. 2004). EUV-driven winds are most important in the inner disk, because the gravitational potential there is too deep for FUV-heated regions at modest temperatures to escape.", "Observations discussed above (see also Simon & Prato 1995 and Wolk & Walter 1996) indicate that the inner and outer disks surrounding YSOs disperse nearly simultaneously and on a very short (\u223c105 years) timescale, based on the small number of transition objects between classical and weak T Tauri systems and the typical classical TTS lifetimes of a few to several million years. Because the accretion time of the outer disk itself determines the system lifetime, rapid removal of the outer disk must be accomplished by other means; photoevaporation is the most natural candidate. Models of photoevaporation that also include viscous disk evolution (which allow spreading both inward and outward) have very recently shown that rapid and near-simultaneous removal of the whole disk indeed occurs (Clarke, Gendrin & Sotomayor 2001; Alexander, Clarke & Pringle 2006a,b). In this process, the accretion rate declines slowly over time until the photoevaporative mass loss rate at some location in the inner disk exceeds the rate at which mass is supplied from larger radii. The inner disk, which is no longer resupplied from outside, then drains rapidly into the star. At the same time, the radiative flux onto the outer disk grows as it is no longer attenuated by the inner disk's atmosphere; the photoevaporation rate in the outer disk climbs dramatically, and it is removed as well.", "Young stellar systems drive very powerful winds. The clearest observable manifestations of YSO winds are the central Herbig-Haro jets consisting of knots of ionized gas (v \u2273 100 km s\u22121), and the larger-scale bipolar outflows consisting of expanding lobes of molecular gas (v \u223c 10 km s\u22121; see \nFigure 3\n). Jet-like outflows (i.e., high-v, narrow molecular structures) are also observed in some circumstances (see below). The high velocities of jets indicate that they represent (a part of) the primary wind from the inner part of the star-disk system, whereas the low velocities and large masses of (broad) molecular outflows indicate that they are made of gas from the star's environment that has been accelerated by an interaction with the wind. In addition to these observed signatures, there may be significant gas in a large-scale primary wind surrounding the jet, which remains undectected owing to lower excitation conditions (low density, temperature, and/or ionization fraction).", "", "\n Figure 3\u2002\n Click to view", "", "Outflows are ubiquitous in high-mass star formation as well as in low-mass star formation (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996). Outflows from high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs) with L < 105\nL\n\u2299 (corresponding to m\n\\* < 25 M\n\u2299\u2014Arnett 1996) are collimated (Beuther et al. 2002b), but somewhat less so than those in low-mass protostars (Wu et al. 2004). In some cases, jets are observed with the outflows, and in these cases the momentum of the jet is generally large enough to drive the observed outflow (Shepherd 2005). No well-collimated flow has been observed in a source with L > 105\nL\n\u2299; as remarked above, disks that are clearly circumstellar have not been observed in such sources either. Beuther & Shepherd (2005) have proposed an evolutionary sequence that is consistent with much of these data: A protostar that eventually will become an O star first passes through the HMPO stage with no HII region and with a well-collimated jet. When the star becomes sufficiently massive and close to the main sequence that it produces an HII region, the outflow becomes less collimated. The collimation systematically decreases as the star grows in mass and the HII region evolves from hypercompact to ultracompact (see Section 4.3.4). The remainder of this section focuses on winds and outflows from low-mass stars, which have been observed in much greater detail than their high-mass counterparts.", "Recent reviews focusing on the observational properties of jets include those of Eisloffel et al. (2000), Reipurth & Bally (2001), and Ray et al. (2007). Jets are most commonly observed at high resolution in optical forbidden lines of O, S, and N, as well as H\u03b1, but recent observations have also included work in the near-IR and near-UV. For CTTs, which are YSOs that are themselves optically revealed, observed optical jets are strongly collimated (aspect ratio at least 10:1, and sometimes 100:1), and in several cases extend up to distances more than a parsec from the central source (Bally, Reipurth & Davis 2007). The jets contain both individual bright knots with bow-shock morphology and more diffuse emission between these knots.", "The emission diagnostics from bright knots are generally consistent with heating by shocks of a few tens of kilometers per second (Hartigan, Raymond & Hartmann 1987; Hartigan, Morse & Raymond 1994), producing postshock temperatures of Te\n \u2248 104 K. The electron density ne\n, ionization fraction xe\n = ne\n/n\nH, and temperature Te\n can be estimated using line ratios (Bacciotti & Eisl\u00f6ffel 1999). Analyses of spectra from a number of jets yields a range of parameters ne\n = (50 \u2212 3 \u00d7 103) cm\u22123 and xe\n = 0.03 \u2212 0.6 so that n = (103 \u2212 105) cm\u22123 (Podio et al. 2006). The total mass loss rate in jets \n\n, and hence the total jet momentum flux, \n\n, can be estimated using jet densities and velocities together with an emission filling factor, yielding \n\n for classical TTSs (Podio et al. 2006). For Class 0 sources, which are much more luminous and have much higher accretion rates, estimated mass-loss rates in jets based on OI emission (from shocked gas) extend up to \n\n (Ceccarelli et al. 1997). Inferred values of \n\n are generally correlated with estimates of \n\nxs from veiling (Hartigan, Edwards & Ghandour 1995), with the ratio in the range of 0.05 \u2212 0.1 (Ray et al. 2007).", "The densities and temperatures obtained from jet diagnostics indicate internal pressures \n\n in the jet, exceeding the ambient pressure in the surrounding core and GMC by a factor of 102 \u2212 104. In principle, infalling envelope gas could provide a nozzle to collimate an emerging wind, but simulations indicate that only relatively weak winds can be so confined as to produce a narrow jet (Delamarter, Frank & Hartmann 2000). This implies that observed jets must be contained within a broader wind, with collimation likely produced by magnetic hoop stresses (see below). Emission line analyses in fact indicate that a lower-velocity [\u223c(10 \u2212 50) km s\u22121] wind component is present near the source, surrounding the high-velocity flow of a few 100 km s\u22121 that emerges as the large-scale jet (Hartigan, Edwards & Ghandour 1995; Hirth, Mundt & Solf 1997; Bacciotti et al. 2000; Pyo et al. 2005). Because velocities of MHD winds scale with the Keplerian rotation speed of the footpoint (see below), the presence of both high- and low-velocity components suggests that winds are driven from a range of radii in the disk. Recent high-resolution observations have detected signatures of differential rotation in jets, using near-UV, optical, and near-IR lines (Bacciotti et al. 2002, Ray et al. 2007); these also indicate a range of wind launch points.", "Recent reviews of the observational properties of molecular outflows include those of Bachiller & Tafalla (1999), Richer et al. (2000), and Arce et al. (2007). Like jets, classical molecular outflows can extend to distances of 0.1 \u2212 1 pc from the central star, but they have much lower velocities (up to a few tens of kilometers per second) and collimation (aspect ratio \u223c 3 \u2212 10). In a few very young, embedded sources, molecular jets with much higher velocities and aspect ratios have been observed in H2, CO, and SiO lines (e.g., Gueth & Guilloteau 1999, Beuther et al. 2002a, Lee et al. 2007). The total momentum flux carried in CO outflows is correlated with the bolometric luminosity of the source and is discussed in Section 3.2.2. For embedded sources with L\nbol = 1 \u2212 105\nL\n\u2299, the momentum flux is \n\n (Richer et al. 2000); in optically revealed sources, this declines considerably (e.g., Bontemps et al. 1996).", "Detailed spectroscopic and morphological analysis of outflows enable intercomparisons with theoretical models. Mapping of outflows reveals both simple expanding shells and more complex features such as multiple cavities and bow shock structures that are suggestive of episodic ejection events (Lee et al. 2002); outflow lobes become broader and more irregular over time (Arce & Sargent 2006). Channel maps and position-velocity diagrams in some sources show parabolic structures that are consistent with driving by wide-angle winds and, in other sources, show spur structures that are consistent with jet driving (Lee et al. 2000, 2001). The strongly curved morphology of internal bow shocks (as seen in both molecular and atomic tracers) indicates that the wind must have velocities that decrease away from the poles, because a time-variable wind with latitudinally-constant velocity produces nearly flat internal shocks (Lee et al. 2001). This implies, in turn, that the wind is driven from a range of radii in the disk, rather than arising from only a narrow region.", "It was recognized very early on that jets and outflows contain more momentum than could possibly be driven by radiation pressure (Lada 1985), whereas the high efficiencies and velocities found by Blandford & Payne (1982) for MHD winds driven from accretion disks in near-Keplerian rotation suggested that the same magnetocentrifugal mechanism could drive winds in YSO systems (Pudritz & Norman 1983). The main requirement for these winds to develop is for the disk to be threaded by magnetic fields of sufficient strength. The mathematical theory of MHD winds and jets is presented in, e.g., Spruit (1996) and Pudritz (2004).", "Over the years, two main types of MHD wind models for YSO systems have been explored. One, the x-wind model (see Shu et al. 1994 and references in Shu et al. 2000 and Shang, Li & Hirano 2007), focuses on the interaction region between the stellar magnetosphere and the inner accretion disk as the source of the wind. In this model, a large portion of the stellar dipole flux is taken to be concentrated into a small range of radii near the point where the magnetosphere and disk corotate. Because YSOs are rapid rotators the corotation point is close to the star, and the wind that would be launched could have terminal speed of a few 100 km s\u22121, as is observed in jets. The second class of MHD wind models assumes that a much larger region of the disk is threaded by open field lines, such that there would be a range of terminal wind speeds, reflecting the range of rotation speeds at the magnetic field's footpoints in the disk (see references in Konigl & Pudritz 2000 and Pudritz et al. 2007). For disk winds, the poloidal magnetic flux could in part be generated locally (e.g., by an MRI dynamo), in part be advected inward with the collapse of the prestellar core, and in part originate in the star and diffuse outward into the disk. Because one type of wind would not exclude the other, it is likely that both x-winds and disk winds are present at some level. This might help, for example, explain particular features of jets such as their strong central density concentration as well as the apparent decrease in velocity from inside to outside.", "The observed rotation velocities in jets can be used to infer the launch point in the disk (Anderson et al. 2003). From the Bernoulli equation for a cold flow along a streamline that rotates with angular velocity \u03a9\n0\n, the quantity \n\n is constant, where \u03a6\ng\n = \u2212Gm\n\\*/r is the gravitational potential and in this section R denotes the cylindrical radius. At R\nobs, where the wind is observed (sufficiently beyond the Alfv\u00e9n transition), the dominant terms in the \n\n equation are the first and the last terms on the right-hand side. For the cases of interest, v\n\u03d5,obs \u226a v\n\np,obs, where vp\n is the poloidal velocity, and \n\n, so that \n\n. The specific angular momentum \n\n is also conserved along streamlines. One can show that this is equal to \u03a90\nRA\n\n2, where RA\n is the Alfv\u00e9n radius of the wind. Because j is dominated by the kinetic term at large distance (where the wind is superfast-magnetosonic), observations can be used to infer the ratio \n\n. For the low velocity component of DG Tau, Anderson et al. (2003) find, from calculating \u03a9\n0\n as above, that the wind launch point radii are \u223c0.3 \u2212 4 AU, implying a disk wind. The high velocity component could originate as either an x-wind or a disk wind from smaller radii. For DG Tau, the inferred ratio RA\n/R\n0 \u2248 2 \u2212 3 is also consistent with numerical solutions that have been obtained for disk winds (see Pudritz et al. 2007 for a summary). This implies that the angular momentum carried by the wind, \n\n, which equals the angular momentum lost by the disk, \n\n, can drive accretion at a rate \n\n.", "The acceleration of MHD winds is provided by a combination of the centrifugal flinging effect produced by rigid poloidal fields and gradients in the toroidal magnetic pressure in the poloidal direction (e.g., Spruit (1996)). Beyond the Alfv\u00e9n surface, magnetic hoop stresses will tend to bend streamlines toward the poles. Full cylindrical streamline collimation, in the sense of \n\n asymptotically, can only occur if B\n\u03d5\nR is finite for R \u2192 \u221e (Heyvaerts & Norman 1989). Using solutions in which all velocities scale as v, vA\n \u221d r\n-1/2 and the density and magnetic field, respectively, scale as \u03c1 \u221d r\n-q and B \u221d r\n\u2212(1 + q)/2, Ostriker (1997) showed, however, that cylindrically collimated disk winds are slow, in the sense that the asymptotic value of vp\n/\u03a90\nR\n0 is at most a few tenths. Because observed jets are fast, they must either have their streamlines collimated by a slower external wind or else be collimated primarily in density rather than velocity. Time-dependent simulations have also shown that the degree of collimation in the flow depends on the distribution of magnetic flux in the disk; cases with steeper distributions of B with R tend to be less collimated in terms of streamline shapes (Fendt 2006; Pudritz, Rogers & Ouyed 2006).", "The idea that nearly radially flowing wide-angle MHD winds may produce a jetlike core, with density stratified on cylinders, was first introduced by Shu et al. (1995) in the context of x-winds. This effect holds more generally, however, as can be seen both analytically (Matzner & McKee 1999) and in simulations (see below). Asymptotically, the density approaches \u03c1 \u2192 |B\n\u03d5| Rk/(\u03a90\nR\n2), where k is the (conserved) mass flux-to-magnetic flux ratio (also termed the mass-loading parameter). Because nearly radially flowing winds must be nearly force-free, |B\n\u03d5|R varies weakly with R, such that if the range of k/\u03a90 over footpoints is smaller than the range of R over which the solution applies (which is generally very large), the wind density will vary as r\n-R. The r\n-R dependence cannot continue to the origin; Matzner & McKee (1999) suggested that precession, internal shocks due to fluctuating wind velocity, or magnetic instabilities would result in a flattening of the density close to the axis so that the momentum flux in the wind \n\n, where \u03b8 is the angle of the flow relative to the axis and \u03b80 \u226a 1 measures the size of the flattened region. This distribution gives approximately equal amounts of momentum in each logarithmic interval of angle for \u03b8 > \u03b80. Several time-dependent numerical MHD simulations have demonstrated this density collimation effect for wide-angle winds (Gardiner, Frank & Hartmann 2003; Krasnopolsky, Li & Blandford 2003; Anderson et al. 2005).", "Magnetized winds are subject to a variety of instabilities (e.g., Kim & Ostriker 2000, Hardee 2004), which may contribute to enhancing the confinement of the jet, structuring the jet column (yielding wanders, twists, and clumps), and mixing with the ambient medium at interfaces. Because jets are likely surrounded by wider winds, they are to some extent protected from the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz and helical modes that that disrupt jets propagating through ambient gas, although development of axisymmetric pinch modes may still contribute to the formation of HH knots (Hardee & Rosen 2002). In addition, lightly loaded poloidal flux within the central core of the wind/jet may help suppress the growth of large-scale pinch and kink instabilities (Ostriker & Shu 1995, Anderson et al. 2006). Time-dependent simulations focusing on the portion of the wind flow above the disk show that while steady winds are possible in certain ranges of the mass-loading parameter for a given distribution of magnetic flux, in other ranges no steady solution is possible (Ouyed & Pudritz 1999, Anderson et al. 2005). Because the spectral diagnostics of HH objects indicate shock speeds of a few tens of kilometers per second, it is plausible that they form due to nonlinear steepening and shocking of wind instabilities.", "Overall, the structure and kinematics of molecular outflows suggest that they are driven by winds that originate from a range of radii in the disk, with a dense central core (seen as a jet) surrounded by a lower density, lower velocity wide-angle wind. Jet driving and wind driving of outflows have traditionally been explored separately, although in practice they would operate in tandem.", "Jets drive outflows as bow shocks, with ambient material swept into a thin shell and carried away from the body of the jet as the shock overtakes and entrains it (Raga & Cabrit 1993, Masson & Chernin 1993), mixing newly shocked material with material that is already flowing outward (Smith, Suttner & Yorke 1997). The leading bow shock is itself created owing to pressure forces at the circumferential boundary of the working surface at the head of the jet, which drive transverse flows. Jets with internal shocks can create analogous bow shocks, with the difference that internal bow shocks would propagate into the wind that surrounds the jet, whereas the leading bow shock would propagate into the ambient medium. Leading bow shocks tend to be fairly narrow, because the cooling of shocked gas in the working surface limits the transverse thrust that can be applied to the shell (Downes & Ray 1999). As a consequence, the width of the shell increases only as the cube root of the distance from the head of the jet (Masson & Chernin 1993, Ostriker et al. 2001). Thus, bow shocks have difficulty explaining broad outflows. However, the convex spur velocity features seen in some systems agree well with the predictions of bow shock models (Lee et al. 2001, Ostriker et al. 2001).", "For wide-angle winds, the momentum flux contained in the transverse bulk motion of the wind is large compared to the thrust that could be provided by pressure forces in the shell of shocked (strongly cooling) gas, so that a momentum-conserving \u201csnowplow\u201d flow is a good approximation. Shu et al. (1991) developed the \u201cwind-swept shell\u201d model of outflows based on this concept, which was able to explain the large opening angles seen in most outflows. Li & Shu (1996) and Matzner & McKee (1999) extended the wind-swept shell analytic model to incorporate the characteristic r\n-R density stratification and logarithmic collimation of streamlines of asymptotic wide-angle MHD winds, as well as allow for latitudinal density stratification in the surrounding core. The mass-velocity and position-velocity relations for these analytic models agree well with those in observed outflows. Numerical simulations of outflows swept up by wide-angle winds (Lee et al. 2001, Shang et al. 2006) are in good agreement with the results of analytic models.", "Outflows affect the immediate environment of the forming star (removing mass from the core before it can collapse into a disk), the clump in which the core forms (also removing mass, and injecting energy), and the larger-scale cloud (injecting energy). The effects of energy injection on clumps forming clusters of stars, and on GMCs as a whole, are discussed in Section 4.3.5 and Section 3.2.2, respectively. Mass removal by winds is related to the star-formation efficiency, which we discuss below.", "The star-formation efficiency \u03b5 can be defined for individual cores, for star-forming clumps, or for GMCs. The correspondence between the CMF and the IMF has been discussed in Section 3.3; they are related by the core star-formation efficiency, \u03b5core \u2261 m\n\\*/M\ncore. (The individual-star IMF must also take into account the multiplicity of the stars formed in a given core.) Nakano, Hasegawa & Norman (1995) showed that outflows from protostars could reverse the infall and determine \u03b5core; they assumed spherical winds and found \u03b5core \u223c a few percent. Matzner & McKee (2000) calculated the dynamics of the outflows including collimation and obtained \u03b5core \u223c 0.25 \u2212 0.75, depending on the degree of flattening of the core owing to magnetic support. Subsequent observations suggest \u03b5core \u2243 1/5 \u22121/3 (Section 3.3.1), at the low end of this range. They also evaluated the star-formation efficiency for a star-forming clump and found typical values somewhat less than 0.5. The predicted values of \u03b5 are inversely proportional to the momentum per unit mass in the outflow, pw\n/m\n\\*; they are consistent with observation for pw\n/m\n\\* \u223c 40 km s\u22121 as assumed, but not if pw\n/m\n\\* is much smaller (see Section 3.2.2 for a discussion of the values of pw\n inferred from observation). Both Nakano, Hasegawa & Norman (1995) and Matzner & McKee (2000) found that \u03b5core is only weakly dependent on the core mass, so that the CMF and the IMF should be similar in shape, as observed (Section 3.3).", "High-mass protostars are characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz times that are smaller than the accretion time, so that they undergo nuclear burning while still accreting (Section 4.1). This leads to two powerful feedback effects that do not apply to low-mass protostars\u2014radiation pressure and photoionization (Larson & Starrfield 1971). Furthermore, high-mass protostars tend to form in dense clusters, so that interaction with other protostars and newly formed stars may be important in their evolution. Drawing on the review by Beuther et al. (2007), we first summarize work on infall onto high-mass protostars and then discuss the feedback effects.", "High-mass star formation is generally taken to be a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation: The accretion rate is \n\n, where the effective sound speed c\neff includes the effects of thermal gas pressure, magnetic pressure, and turbulence (Stahler, Shu & Taam 1980, although they did not address the issue of high-mass star formation). As discussed in Section 4.1, there may be a numerical factor of a few in front of the c\n3\neff/G. Wolfire & Cassinelli (1987) found that accretion rates of order 10\u22123\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121 are needed to overcome the effects of radiation pressure for the highest stellar masses, and attributed this to the high values of c\neff in high-mass star-forming regions. Myers & Fuller (1992) used their thermal/nonthermal model (Section 2.2) to infer formation times for (10 \u2212 30) M\n\u2299 stars of (6 \u2212 10) \u00d7 105 years; the turbulent envelopes allow equilibrium cores to have greater densities and shorter collapse times than those supported by thermal pressure alone. Caselli & Myers (1995) extended this to more massive stars and found formation times >106 years for stars of 100 M\n\u2299, a significant fraction of the main sequence lifetime. However, by modeling the SEDs of high-mass protostars, Osorio, Lizano & D\u2019Alessio (1999) inferred that high-mass stars form in somewhat less than 105 years and favored a logatropic model for the density distribution of the core. Nakano et al. (2000) inferred an accretion rate of 10\u22122\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121 (corresponding to a formation time of a few thousand years) for the source IRc2 in Orion based on the assumption that the accretion rate is \u223c10 c\n3\neff/G, with the effective sound speed c\neff determined from the observed linewidth.", "The turbulent core model for high-mass star formation (McKee & Tan 2002, 2003) follows from the assumption that such stars form in turbulent, gravitationally bound cores (virial parameter \u03b1vir \u223c 1). The turbulence is self-similar on all scales above the Bonnor-Ebert scale, where thermal pressure dominates. The star-forming clump and the protostellar cores within it are assumed to be centrally concentrated so that the pressure and density have a power-law dependence on radius, P \u221d r\n\u2212kP\n\n, \u03c1 \u221d r\n\u2212k\u03c1. It follows that the cores are polytropes (Section 2.2), and because the Bonnor-Ebert scale is small, the cores are approximately singular. The protostellar infall rate is determined by the surface density of the protostellar core, which in turn is comparable to that of the clump in which it is embedded. The regions of high-mass star formation studied by Plume et al. (1997) have surface densities \u03a3cl \u223c 1 g cm\u22123, corresponding to visual extinctions AV\n \u223c 200 mag; these values are similar to those for observed star clusters in the Galaxy (e.g., \u223c0.2 g cm\u22122 in the Orion Nebula Cluster, 0.8 g cm\u22122 for the median globular cluster and \u223c 4 g cm\u22122 in the Arches Cluster). By contrast, regions of low-mass star formation have \u03a3 \u223c 0.03 g cm\u22122, corresponding to AV\n \u223c 7 mag (Onishi et al. 1996). The radius of a protostellar core is", "where m\n\\*f\n is the final stellar mass. The second expression is based on the result that the surface density of a typical core is comparable to that of the clump in which it is embedded; cores near the center of a clump have higher surface densities, and the sizes are correspondingly smaller. Using the results of McLaughlin & Pudritz (1997) for the inside-out collapse of a singular polytrope and adopting k\n\u03c1 = 3/2, a typical density power-law from Plume et al. (1997), McKee & Tan (2003) found that the typical infall rate and the corresponding time to form a star of mass m\n\\*f\n are", "and", "where \u03a3cl is the surface density (in g cm\u22122) of the several thousand M\n\u2299 clump in which the star is forming. For typical values of \u03a3cl \u223c 1 g cm\u22122, the star-formation time is of order 105 years and the infall rate is of order 10\u22123\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121. This infall rate is large enough to overcome the effects of radiation pressure at the dust destruction front, thereby addressing one of the key theoretical difficulties for models of high-mass star formation (see below). The mean infall rate could be somewhat larger than given in Equation 52 if the core was initially overdense or contracting, and turbulence in the core could generate large fluctuations in the infall rate. However, the infall rate given above is only a few times greater than the free-fall value and is unlikely to be much larger.", "The key assumptions in this model are that stars form from preassembled cores (although because the cores are turbulent, there will be significant mass exchange with the ambient medium); that the cores and the clumps in which they are embedded are in approximate virial equilibrium; and that they are magnetically supercritical, so that the magnetic field does not significantly limit the rate of accretion. Evidence in support of the first assumption has been obtained by Beuther, Sridharan & Saito (2005) and Sridharan et al. (2005); the remaining assumptions are also subject to observational test. The model is necessarily approximate, as it treats the turbulence as a local pressure (the microturbulent approximation), and because it incorporates all the feedback effects owing to radiation pressure and photoevaporation in the core star-formation efficiency, \u03b5core, which was assumed to be of order 1/2. Some of the large density fluctuations in the supersonically turbulent cores will form low-mass stars, but most of the mass of the core is assumed to go into one or two massive stars. Dobbs, Bonnell & Clark (2005) have criticized the model on the ground that the massive cores would fragment and form many low-mass stars rather than a single massive star, but radiative heating by the rapidly accreting high-mass protostar strongly suppresses fragmentation (Krumholz 2006; Krumholz, Klein & McKee 2007). The turbulent core model is consistent with the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3), and it naturally allows for the disks and winds associated with high-mass stars (see Section 4.2) because it is an extrapolation of low-mass star-formation theory. The cores are predicted to be denser than the clump in which they are embedded by about (M\nclump/M\ncore)1/2, which is much greater than unity for stellar mass cores embedded in clumps with M > 103\nM\n\u2299; this naturally overcomes the crowding problem.", "An alternative class of gravitational collapse models involves rapidly accelerating accretion (\n\n with q > 1, so that m\n\\* \u2192 \u221e in a finite time in the absence of other effects). Building on the work of Norberg & Maeder (2000), Behrend & Maeder (2001) assumed that the accretion rates are proportional to the mass outflow rates observed in protostellar outflows; because the outflows are swept-up material, the justification for this assumption is unclear. They found t\n\\*f\n \u223c 3 \u00d7 105 years for massive stars, with most of the growth occurring in the last 10% of this time. In the competitive accretion model (Bonnell et al. 1997; see Section 4.1.2), massive stars form via Bondi-Hoyle accretion (\n\n). Keto (2002, 2003) has studied this model further, focusing on the associated HII regions. For a 10-M\n\u2299 star in a typical high-mass star-forming clump observed by Plume et al. (1997), which has a mass \u223c4000 M\n\u2299 and a virial parameter of order unity, the BH accretion rate is much smaller than that expected in the turbulent core model (McKee & Tan 2003), even after allowing for the turbulent enhancement factor \u03d5BH (Equation 47). The rate of BH accretion increases if the virial parameter is small, if the infall occurs onto a cluster of stars that is much more massive than a single star (as Keto comments), or if the infall occurs from a significantly less massive clump. In the latter two cases the assumptions underlying BH accretion begin to break down, and further study is needed to determine the infall rate. Edgar & Clarke (2004) have shown that radiation pressure halts BH accretion when the star is moving supersonically relative to the gas for m\n\\* > 10 M\n\u2299, because the luminosity is large enough that radiation pressure deflects gas away from the star.", "In view of the challenges facing conventional theories of high-mass star formation, Bonnell, Bate & Zinnecker (1998) made the radical suggestion that high-mass stars form via stellar collisions. This model requires stellar densities of \u223c108 stars pc\u22123 during the brief period in which the stars grow by merging. This coalescence model produces an IMF that is in qualitative agreement with observations, although no feedback effects were included in the calculations (Bonnell et al. 2001b). This model faces a number of challenges: (a) The required stellar density is far greater than has been observed in any Galactic star cluster. For example, W3 IRS5 is one of the densest clusters observed to date, with five proto OB stars in a sphere of radius 0.015 pc (Megeath, Wilson & Corbin 2005); the corresponding stellar density \u223c4 \u00d7 105 pc\u22123 is lower than required by the coalescence model by more than two orders of magnitude, although it must be borne in mind that the number of lower mass stars in that volume is currently unknown. (b) For large OB protoclusters, the hypothesized ultradense state would produce a very luminous, compact source, yet this has never been observed. (c) The mass loss that is hypothesized to reduce the cluster density to observed values must be finely tuned in order to leave the cluster marginally bound. (d) Finally, it is difficult to see how the model could account for the observed disks and outflows discussed above. Bally & Zinnecker (2005) discuss a number of observational tests of the coalescence model, and suggest that the wide-angle outflow from OMC-1 in the Orion molecular cloud could be due to the merger of two protostars that released 1048 \u2212 1049 erg. Two variants of the coalescence model have been suggested: Stahler, Palla & Ho (2000) proposed that gas bound to the protostars could increase the cross section for collisions, although they did not explain why this would result in stellar coalescence rather than the formation of a binary. Bonnell & Bate (2005) have proposed an explanation for this: assuming that the gas has negligible angular momentum (which is plausible if the turbulence is weak, as assumed in the competitive accretion model), then accretion drives the stars in the binary to closer separations and ultimately to a merger. The stellar density required for the binary coalescence model is \u223c 3 \u00d7 106 stars pc\u22123, substantially smaller than in the direct coalescence model but higher than observed nonetheless. However, Krumholz & Thompson (2006) argue that pre-main-sequence evolution of tight, high-mass protostellar binaries can lead to equal-mass binaries, as often observed, rather than to mergers.", "\nBeuther et al. (2007) have summarized the current state of observations of high-mass star formation. They divide the formation of individual high-mass stars into four stages:", "The earliest stages of high-mass star formation may occur in the Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs\u2013Egan et al. 1998), which have properties consistent with being the dense clumps out of which clusters eventually form (Simon et al. 2006). To date, few true HMSCs have been detected\u2014high-mass cores often appear to have some signatures of star formation. In the turbulent core model, this could be because the central densities in the cores are much greater than the mean densities (in contrast to the case for low-mass cores), and the timescale for gravitational collapse is correspondingly shorter. The lack of true HMSCs is also consistent with the competitive accretion model or the coalescence model, because in these models HMSCs do not exist. Evidence for HMSCs harboring low-/intermediate-mass protostars, or possibly relatively low-mass HMPOs, has been obtained only recently (Beuther et al. 2005, Sridharan et al. 2005). HMPOs are often (but not always) associated with hot molecular cores (HMCs), which have a rich chemistry (van der Tak 2005). HMPOs are often associated with H2O and Class II CH3OH maser emission, although the interpretation of this emission remains ambiguous. HMPOs are also associated with HII regions (see Section 4.3.4); many should have hypercompact HII regions and some should be associated with ultracompact HII regions, but most ultracompact HII regions are associated with the final stars.", "Observational tests of infall models for high-mass protostars are difficult owing to their large distances (typically \u2273 2 kpc), crowding, large extinctions, and confounding effects of HII regions. Several tests are possible: if confirmed, the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3) would be consistent with the turbulent core model; the properties of disks and winds associated with HMPOs can provide important clues (Section 4.2.1); the SEDs of embedded sources provide information on the distribution of circumstellar matter on scales smaller than can be directly resolved (Osorio, Lizano & D\u2019Alessio 1999; Chakrabarti & McKee 2005; Whitney et al. 2005); and chemical clocks can provide direct measures of the timescale for the growth of HMPOs. To this end, Doty, van Dishoeck & Tan (2006) have developed the first model for the chemical evolution of an HMPO, including the evolution of the central source, infall, and adsorption and desorption of ices from grains. They find that the timescale for the warm chemistry is set by the time it takes for matter to flow through the warm region, and that the total age of the HMPO they study (AFGL 2591) is (0.3 \u2212 1) \u00d7 105 years.", "One measure of the importance of radiation pressure is to compare the stellar luminosity with the luminosity at which the force due to radiation pressure balances gravity. Because dust provides the dominant opacity to nonionizing radiation in the ISM, this generalized Eddington luminosity is", "where \u03ba\nd\n is the dust opacity per unit mass, and c is the speed of light. The dust in the infalling gas sublimates when it reaches the dust destruction front at \n\n cm (Wolfire & Cassinelli 1987). We approximate the radiation field outside R\ndd as a black body with a temperature T that declines with radius. As an example, consider the Pollack et al. (1994) dust model: \u03ba\nd\n (T) first rises with temperature as the average frequency increases, but then declines for T \u2273 600 K as some of the grain species sublimate. The maximum opacity is \u03ba \u2243 8 cm2 g\u22121, which leads to \nLE,d\n \u2243 1600(m\n\\*/M\n\u2299) L\n\u2299\n.

They are classified into two types: Ultra-compact HII (UCHII) regions have diameters (0.01 \u2212 0.1) pc, densities \u2265 104 cm\u22123, and emission measures \u222b ne\n\n2\ndl \u2265 107 pc cm\u22126 (Wood & Churchwell 1989). Hypercompact HII (HCHII) regions have diameters < 0.01 pc with emission measures \u2265 108 pc cm\u22126 (Beuther et al. 2007; for a slightly different definition and a review of both types of HII region, see Hoare et al. 2007). HCHII regions often appear in tight groups in high-mass star-forming regions, and they often have broad radio recombination lines with widths that can exceed 100 km s\u22121.", "The high accretion rates characteristic of HMPOs delay the point at which the stars reach the main sequence (McKee & Tan 2003, Krumholz & Thompson 2006), thereby delaying the time at which the photosphere is hot enough to produce an HII region. High accretion rates also quench the emission of ionizing photons once the star has reached the main sequence (Walmsley 1995).

For an ionizing photon luminosity S, the radius of the HCHII region is", "where", "(Omukai & Inutsuka 2002), where \u03b1(2) is the recombination rate to excited states of hydrogen and where we have replaced the proton mass in their expression with \u03bcH = 2.34 \u00d7 10\u221224 g, the mass per hydrogen nucleus. Provided the accretion is spherical, the HII region is quenched for S \u2272 S\ncr. If S/S\ncr is not too large (\u2272 7), R\nHCHII is less than rg\n/2, and the infall velocity at the Stromgren radius exceeds 2ci\n, the minimum velocity of an R-critical ionization front; as a result there is no shock in the accretion flow and the HII region cannot undergo the classical pressure-driven expansion (Keto 2002). If the accretion is via a disk, as is generally expected, then the ionizing photons can escape out of the plane of the disk, and the HII region will not be trapped (Keto & Wood 2006; Keto 2007). Disk accretion is often associated with the production of winds, and Tan & McKee (2003) have suggested that such winds confine HCHII regions: The winds clear the gas along the axis, and the ionizing radiation then illuminates the inner surfaces of the winds. If correct, this offers the possibility of a powerful diagnostic for determining the nature of disk winds associated with massive stars. van der Tak & Menten (2005) found very compact radio emission aligned with the outflows in two high-mass protostellar sources, consistent with this picture. When the ionizing luminosity becomes large enough, however, the wind will become ionized and the HII region will evolve to a UCHII state. The ionizing photons will photoevaporate the surface of the disk at a rate of order \n\n few \u00d7 10\u22125 (S/1049 s\u22121)1/2\nM\n\u2299 year\u22121; absorption of ionizing photons by dust can significantly affect this (Hollenbach et al. 1994, Richling & Yorke 1997). This mass-loss rate is too small to be important in setting the maximum mass of the star (although it can be important in primordial star formation\u2014McKee & Tan, in preparation). Absorption of ionizing photons by dust must also be taken into account when inferring the ionizing luminosity of the central star from the properties of the HII region (Dopita et al. 2006 and references therein).", "Most stars are born in clusters (e.g., Lada & Lada 2003, Allen et al. 2007), and this is particularly true of high-mass stars. The mass distribution of clusters appears to obey a universal power-law, \n\n, with \u03b1\u2243 1. With this distribution, \n\n const: Taken together, clusters in each decade of mass have the same total number of stars. Lada & Lada (2003) find that very young clusters within 2 kpc of the Sun that are still embedded in their natal molecular clouds obey this power-law for M \u2273 50 M\n\u2299; the upper limit of the observed distribution is set by the largest cluster expected in the area they surveyed. The mass distribution of OB associations in the Galaxy also has a power-law distribution with \u03b1 \u2243 1 (McKee & Williams 1997); they inferred that the distribution extended from \u223c 50 M\n\u2299 to 2 \u00d7 105\nM\n\u2299 and could account for all the stars formed in the Galaxy. Kennicutt, Edgar & Hodge (1989) found that the luminosity distribution of HII regions in disk galaxies obeys \n\n, which is consistent with an r\n-M distribution because the luminosity is proportional to mass for associations that are large enough to fully sample the IMF. The distribution of OB associations in the SMC has \u03b1 = 1 from the largest associations down to associations with a single OB star (Oey, King & Parker 2004). The star clusters in the \u201cAntennae\u201d galaxies show \u03b1 = 1 over the mass range 104\nM\n\u2299 < M < 106\nM\n\u2299\n (Zhang & Fall 1999); this is one of the best determined cluster mass functions, and has an error, including systematic errors, estimated at \u00b1 0.1. The mass distributions of open clusters and globular clusters are also consistent with an r\n-M distribution at birth (Elmegreen & Efremov 1997). Dowell, Buckalew & Tan (2007, submitted) found \u03b1 \u2243 0.9 for clusters in irregular galaxies and \u03b1 \u2243 0.75 in disk galaxies, but comment that this result could be affected by the low spatial resolution of the data. The r\n-M mass distribution of clusters is intermediate between the high-mass part of the IMF (M\n-1.35) on the one hand, and the observed mass distribution of GMCs (M\n-0.6) and the clumps within them (M\n-0.3 \u2192 M\n-0.7; Section 3.1) on the other. It is important to understand the origin of the difference between the cluster IMF and the mass function of GMCs and clumps if it is real, and not an artifact of limited statistics.", "The structure of star clusters contains clues to their formation. High-mass stars in Galactic clusters that are massive enough to contain a number of such stars are observed to be segregated toward the center of the cluster. Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998) analyzed the spatial distribution of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and concluded that the high-mass stars were born preferentially near the center. Using N-body simulations, Bonnell & Davies (1998) showed that it takes a relaxation time, \n\n for \n\n), for high-mass stars to collect near the center of a cluster due to dynamical interactions. In the case of the ONC, they argued that significant dynamical mass segregation has occurred, but not enough to account for the observed central concentration of OB stars; they concluded therefore that the observed mass segregation is primordial. Tan, Krumholz & McKee (2006) suggested both a greater age and a longer crossing time for the ONC, but the basic conclusion does not change. In NGC 3603, the most luminous Galactic star cluster that is not heavily obscured, Stolte et al. (2006) found that the maximum mass of the stars decreases away from the center of the cluster, with all the most massive stars being quite close to the center, and again concluded that the segregation is primordial. These arguments for primordial mass segregation have been weakened by the realization that subclustering in the initial cluster significantly accelerates the rate of dynamical mass segregation (McMillan, Vesperini & Portegies Zwart 2007). In addition, most estimates do not account for dynamical friction between the stars and the surrounding gas, which can considerably reduce the mass segregation timescale (Ostriker 1999). However, recent observations have reinforced the argument for primordial mass segregation: Megeath, Wilson & Corbin (2005) have found a Trapezium-like cluster in W3 IRS5 that is deeply embedded in molecular gas and is only half the radius of the ONC. In \u03c1 Oph, Stanke et al. (2006) found direct evidence for primordial mass segregation by showing that the CMF exhibits mass segregation as well; this also supports the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF discussed in Section 3.3. The large fraction of O stars that are runaways can be naturally explained if they originate in dense, mass-segregated clusters and undergo dynamical interactions (Clarke & Pringle 1992). The cluster R136 in the LMC appears to be an exception to the rule that high-mass stars are centrally concentrated, because half the massive stars are located outside the central core (Stolte et al. 2006).", "Only a small fraction of clusters survive as bound clusters to an age of 108 years\u2014Lada & Lada (2003) estimate this fraction as 4 = 7%. In order for a cluster to remain bound, its natal clump must have a high star-formation efficiency. Analytic estimates suggest that if the gas in the clump is removed suddenly, such as by an HII region, one requires \u03b5clump > 0.5 in order for the cluster to remain bound, whereas if the gas is removed gradually, the cluster will expand adiabatically and lower values suffice (Hills 1980; Mathieu 1983). Numerical calculations show that a fraction of the cluster survives even if the mass ejection is abrupt (Lada, Margulis & Dearborn 1984). Kroupa, Aarseth & Hurley (2001) modeled the evolution of the ONC with \u03b5clump = 0.3 and a sudden mass ejection; they concluded that 30% of the mass of the ONC would remain bound and that it would evolve into a cluster like the Pleiades. Star-formation efficiencies in the embedded clusters in the Solar Neighborhood are observed to be \u22430.1 \u2212 0.3 (Lada & Lada 2003); because star formation is ongoing in these clusters, the final value of the star-formation efficiency, \u03b5clump, is near the upper limit of this range. Matzner & McKee (2000) calculated the star-formation efficiency for clumps in which the mass loss is dominated by protostellar outflows (\nM \u2272 1 \u2212 3 \u00d7 103\nM\n\u2299\n). (Note that the clump star-formation efficiency, \u03b5clump, which is the fraction of the mass of a clump that goes into a cluster of stars, is distinct from the core star-formation efficiency, \u03b5core, which is the fraction of a core mass that goes into a single or binary star.) They estimated \u03b5clump \u2243 0.4 for clumps with escape velocities v\nesc \u2243 2 km s\u22121, comparable to the observed value. The star-formation efficiency is predicted to rise with v\nesc\u2014i.e., with increasing mass and/or density of the clump.", "The star-formation efficiency for larger clusters, ranging up to globular clusters and super star clusters (SSCs; e.g., Ho & Filippenko 1996) is most likely determined by the HII regions that form in the clusters. Because globular clusters are much more centrally concentrated than open clusters that form in the disk of the Galaxy today, it is likely that their star-formation efficiency, \u03b5clump, was higher. (Note that a high star-formation efficiency over the life of the clump, \u03b5clump, is consistent with a low value of the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time, \u03b5ff,clump, only if clusters form over a number of free-fall times, and conversely, cluster formation in 1\u20132 dynamical times requires a relatively high value of \u03b5ff,clump\u2014see Section 3.4.) Using a simple phenomenological model, Elmegreen & Efremov (1997) showed how \u03b5clump should increase with both the mass of the natal clump and its pressure, P \u221d \u03a3cl\n2. They point out that high pressures are naturally produced in merging galaxies, accounting for the large number of SSCs seen in such systems. The high surface densities of globular clusters implies that they necessarily formed in high pressure environments (see also McKee & Tan 2003). High star-formation efficiencies are possible in a clump with embedded HII regions because their destructive effect is significantly reduced in a clump composed of dense cores (Tan & McKee 2001, Dale et al. 2005). For sufficiently massive and concentrated clusters, the escape velocity exceeds the sound speed of ionized gas, and this can further increase the star-formation efficiency (Kroupa & Boily 2002, Matzner 2002, Tan & McKee 2004).", "How do stars form in clusters? The natal clumps of embedded clusters in the Solar Neighborhood have densities \u223c104 \u2212 5 cm\u22123 and masses \u223c102 \u2212 3\nM\n\u2299 (Lada & Lada 2003), and more broadly distributed high-mass star-forming clumps in the Galaxy have densities \u223c105 cm\u22123 and masses \u223c103.5\nM\n\u2299 (Plume et al. 1997). These extreme conditions have led to suggestions that the process of high-mass star formation is qualitatively different from that observed in regions of low-mass star formation (Section 4.3.1) or that it is triggered by an external effect. In a review of triggered star formation, Elmegreen (1992) pointed out that triggering generally does not affect the star-formation efficiency by more than a factor of two. In any case, triggered star formation loses much of its meaning in a theory of star formation based on turbulence, because in most cases the triggering event is just a manifestation of the intermittency of the turbulence. The observed correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3) and the constancy of the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time (Section 3.4) suggest a more unified picture in which stars form via gravitational collapse in a turbulent medium over most, if not all, the range of observed clustering.", "Key goals of a theory of star formation are to predict the rate of star formation and the distribution of stellar masses on the macroscopic scale, and to predict the properties of individual stars from the initial conditions on the microscopic scale. In the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the theory from star formation in a quasi-static medium to star formation that occurs in a supersonically turbulent one, and this has led to significant progress on both fronts. Based on our current understanding, the narrative of star formation contains the following elements:", "The coming decade will test and revise this narrative of star formation, particularly with the advent of ALMA and JWST, and with the continued advances in numerical simulation. Turning this narrative into a quantitative, predictive theory will provide a foundation for addressing many of the outstanding questions in astrophysics today, ranging from the formation of planets to the evolution of galaxies and the origin of the elements.", "The authors are not aware of any biases that might be perceived as affecting the objectivity of this review.", "We are grateful to our expert readers, J.

Nowadays, we speak of near-field cosmology in which detailed studies of the Galaxy underlie our understanding of universal processes over cosmic time (Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002). Within the context of the cold dark matter paradigm, the Galaxy built up over billions of years through a process of hierarchical accretion (see \nFigure 1\n). Our Galaxy has recognizable components that are likely to have emerged at different stages of the formation process. In particular, the early part of the bulge may have collapsed first, seeding the early stages of a massive black hole, followed by a distinct phase that gave rise to the thick disk. The inner halo may have formed about the same time, whereas the outer halo has built up later through the progressive accretion of shells of material over cosmic time (Prada et al. 2006). The dominant thin disk reflects a different form of accretion over the same long time frame (Brook et al. 2012).\n", "", "\n Figure 1\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "We live in an age when vast surveys have been carried out across the entire sky in many wave bands. At optical and IR wavelengths, billions of stars have been cataloged with accurate photometric magnitudes and colors (Skrutskie et al. 2006, Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2012, Saito et al. 2012). But only a fraction of these stars have high-quality spectral classifications, radial velocities, and distances, with an even smaller fraction having useful elemental abundance determinations. The difficulty of measuring a star's age continues to hamper progress in Galactic studies, but this stumbling block will be partly offset by the ESA Gaia astrometric survey already under way. By the end of the decade, this mission will have measured accurate distances and velocity vectors for many millions of stars arising from all major components of the Galaxy (de Bruijne et al. 2015). In light of this impending data set, we review our present understanding of the main dynamical and structural parameters that describe our home, the Milky Way.", "We run into a problem familiar to cartographers. How is one to describe the complexity of the Galaxy? No two galaxies are identical; even the best morphological analogues with the Milky Way have important differences (\nFigure 2\n). Historically, astronomers have resorted to defining discrete components with the aim of measuring their structural parameters (see \nTable 1\n). We continue to see value in this approach and proceed to define what we mean by each subsystem and the best estimates that can be made at the present time. In reality, these \u201ccomponents\u201d exhibit strong overlap by virtue of sharing the same evolving Galactic potential (e.g., Guedes et al. 2013) and the likelihood that stars migrate far from their formation sites (Sellwood & Binney 2002, Minchev & Famaey 2010).\n", "", "\n Figure 2\u2002\n Click to view", "", "Description of Galactic parameters\n", "afbary is the ratio of baryonic mass to total mass integrated to a radius in which both quantities have been determined (e.g., rvir).", "Note: Our convention is to use r for a projected radius in two dimensions (e.g., disk) and r for a radius in three dimensions (e.g., halo).

In particular, how are we to separate the bar/bulge from the inner disk and inner halo? A distinct possibility is that most of our small bulge (compared to M31) has formed through a disk instability associated with bar formation, rather than during a dissipational early collapse phase. The same challenge exists in separating the thin disk from the thick disk. Some have argued for a gradual transition but there is now good evidence that a major part of the thick disk is chemically distinct from the dominant thin disk, suggesting a different origin. In this context, Binney (2013) has argued that the Galaxy's stellar populations are better described by phase-space distribution functions (DFs) that are self-consistent with the underlying gravitational potential (Section 5).", "Our goal here is to identify the useful structural and kinematic parameters that aid comparison with other galaxies and place our Galaxy in context. These \u201cmeasurables\u201d are also important for comparing with numerical simulations of synthetic galaxies. A simulator runs a disk simulation and looks to compare the evolutionary phase where the bar/bulge instability manifests itself. In principle, only a statistically good fit is needed without resorting to any parameterization (Sharma et al. 2011). But in practice, the comparison is likely to involve global properties like rotation curves, scale lengths, total mass (gas, stars, dark matter), stellar abundances, and the star-formation history. Here we focus on establishing what the best estimates are for the Galaxy's global properties and the parameters that describe its traditional components.", "\nKerr & Lynden-Bell (1986) revisited the 1964 IAU (International Astronomical Union) standards for the Sun's distance and circular velocity (R\n0=10 kpc, \u03980=250 km s\u22121) relative to the Galactic Center and proposed a downward revision (R\n0=8.5 kpc, \u03980=220 km s\u22121). Both values can now be revised further to reflect the new observational methods at our disposal three decades on. Our goal in this review is to provide an at-a-glance summary of the key structural and kinematic parameters to aid the increasing focus on Galactic studies. For reasons that become clear in later sections, we cannot yet provide summary values that are all internally consistent in a plausible dynamical description of the Galaxy; this is an important aim for the next few years. For more scientific context, we recommend reviews from the past decade that consider major components of the Galaxy: Helmi (2008), Ivezi\u0107 et al.

In key respects, the Milky Way is typical of large galaxies today in low-density environments (Kormendy et al. 2010), especially with a view to global parameters (e.g., current SFR \n\n, baryon fraction f\nbary) given its total stellar mass (cf. de Rossi et al. 2009), as we discuss below. But in other respects, it is relatively unusual, caught in transition between the \u201cred sequence\u201d of galaxies and the \u201cblue cloud\u201d (Mutch et al. 2011). Moreover, unlike M31, our Galaxy has not experienced a major merger for the past 10 Gyr, indicating a remarkably quiescent accretion history for a luminous galaxy (Stewart et al. 2008). Most L\n\u22c6 galaxies lie near the turnover of the galaxy luminosity function where star-formation quenching starts to become effective (Benson et al. 2003). But this may not be the last word for the Galaxy: The Magellanic gas stream is evidence for very substantial (\u223c109 M\u2299) and ongoing gas accretion in the present day (Putman et al. 1998, Fox et al. 2014). The Galaxy stands out in another respect: It is uncommon for an L\n\u22c6 galaxy to be orbited by two luminous dwarf galaxies that are both forming stars (Robotham et al. 2012). Nonetheless, the Galaxy will always be the most important benchmark for galaxy evolution because it provides information that few other galaxies can offer\u2014the fully resolved constituents that make up an L\n\u22c6 galaxy in the present epoch.", "The Galaxy is one of the two dominant members of the Local Group, a low-mass system constituting a loosely bound collection of spirals and dwarf galaxies. The Local Group has an internal velocity dispersion of about 60 km s\u22121 (van den Bergh 1999) and is located in a low-density filament in the far outer reaches of the Virgo supercluster of galaxies (Tully et al. 2014). Galaxy groups with one or two dominant spirals are relatively common, but close analogues of the Local Group are rare. The presence of an infalling binary pair\u2014the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds (SMC, LMC)\u2014around an L\n\u22c6 galaxy is only seen in a few percent of cases in the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (Driver et al. 2011). This frequency drops to less than 1% if we add the qualification that the massive binary pair are actively forming stars.", "With a view to past and future evolution, it is instructive to look at numerical simulations of the Local Group. The Constrained Local Universe Simulations\u2014the CLUES project (\nhttp://www.clues-project.org\n)\u2014are optimized for a study of the formation of the Local Group within a cosmological context (Forero-Romero et al. 2013, Yepes et al. 2014). The accretion history of the Local Group is relatively quiet, consistent with its cold internal dynamics. The largest simulations with the most advanced prescriptions for feedback (e.g., the Feedback in Realistic Environments or FIRE project, Hopkins et al. 2014) are providing new insight on why only a small fraction of the dark minihalos in orbit about the Galaxy are visible as dwarf galaxies (Wetzel et al. 2016). But we are still a long way from a detailed understanding of how the dark matter and baryons work together to produce present-day galaxies.", "The future orbital evolution and merging of the Local Group has been considered by several groups (Cox & Loeb 2008, van der Marel et al. 2012a, Peebles & Tully 2013). These models are being successively refined as proper motions of stars in M31 become available. We learn that the Galaxy and M31 will reach pericenter passage in about 4 Gyr and finally merge in \u223c6 Gyr. The models serve to remind us that the Galaxy is undergoing at least three strong interactions (LMC, SMC, Sgr) and therefore cannot be in strict dynamical equilibrium. This evolution can be accommodated in terms of structural and kinematic parameters (adiabatic invariants) that are slowly evolving at present (Binney 2013).", "For most of the past century, galaxy studies made use of morphological classification to separate them into different classes. But high-quality, multiband photometric and spectroscopic surveys have provided us with a different perspective (Blanton & Moustakas 2009). The bulge-to-disk ratio, e.g., from S\u00e9rsic index fitting to photometric images, continues to play an important role in contemporary studies (Driver et al. 2011). Many observed properties correlate with the total stellar mass M\n\u22c6 and the global SFR \n\n. Galaxies fall into a \u201cred sequence\u201d where star formation has been largely quenched, and a \u201cblue cloud\u201d (main sequence) where objects are actively forming stars, with an intervening \u201cgreen valley.\u201d Mutch et al.

Their method is based on the Copernican principle that the Galaxy is unlikely to be extraordinary given global estimates for M\n\u22c6 and \n\n. In large galaxy samples, these quantities are expected to correlate closely with photometric properties like absolute magnitude and color index with a scatter of about 0.2 dex.

When considering both the current uncertainties in Milky Way properties and the scatter of galaxies about the relation, the Galaxy is consistent with the Tully-Fisher relation to better than 1\u03c3 uncertainty. The Milky Way appears to be a kinematically typical spiral galaxy for its intrinsic luminosity.", "The Galactic Center (GC), as we understand it today, was first identified through the discovery of Sgr A by radio astronomers (Piddington & Minnett 1951). Based on its unique radio emission properties and its precise coincidence with the dynamical center of the rotating inner \n\n disk (Oort & Rougoor 1960), the IAU officially adopted Sgr A as the center of the Galaxy, making its position the zero of longitude and latitude in a new system of Galactic coordinates (Blaauw et al. 1959). Later Balick & Brown (1974) discovered the unresolved source Sgr A\\*, now known to be at the location of the Milky Way's supermassive black hole (SMBH), at (lc\n, bc\n)=(\u22120.056\u00b0, \u22120.046\u00b0) (Reid & Brunthaler 2004).", "Thirty years ago, Kerr & Lynden-Bell (1986, p. 1024) gave this working definition of the GC:\n\n", "", "Indeed, in a hierarchical universe the first assumption is almost certainly violated beyond tens of kiloparsecs: We discuss in Section 6 that the Galaxy continues to accrete satellite galaxies carrying both stars and dark matter; furthermore, the Milky Way's dark matter halo interacts both with infalling dark matter and with other halos in the Local Group. However, as discussed below, the inner Milky Way appears to have \u201csettled down\u201d to a well-defined and well-centered midplane; thus we may assume that the region of greatest star density coincides with the barycenter of the mass within the Solar Circle.", "The second part of the definition may ultimately also come into question. Numerical simulations reveal that dark matter halos tumble at the level of a few radians per Hubble time. The baryonic components are largely bound to the dark matter but may slosh around within them. Furthermore, the spin axis of the Galactic Plane is likely to precess with respect to a celestial coordinate frame defined by distant quasars or radio sources. Over the lifetime of the Gaia mission, this precession (\u223c30\u03bcas year\u22121) should be detectable (Perryman et al. 2014).", "The distance of the Sun to the GC, R\n0, is one of the fundamental scaling parameters for the Galaxy. All distances determined from angular sizes or from radial velocities and a rotation model are proportional to R\n0. Also the sizes, luminosities, and masses of objects such as molecular clouds scale with R\n0, as do most estimates of global Galactic luminosity and mass. Because R\n0 is one of the key parameters, we consider its measured value in some detail here. Previous reviews on this subject have been written by Kerr & Lynden-Bell (1986), Reid (1993), Genzel et al. (2010), and Gillessen et al. (2013), and a recent compilation of results is given by Malkin (2013).", "Similar to their discussions, we divide methods of determining R\n0 into direct (primary), model-based, and secondary ones. Direct methods compare an angular dimension or velocity near the GC with a physical length scale or radial velocity (RV), with minimal modeling assumptions and without having to use additional calibrations. Model-based methods determine R\n0 as one of the model parameters through a global fit to a set of data. Secondary methods finally use standard candle tracers whose distances are based on secondary calibrations such as period-stellar luminosity relations, and whose distributions are known or assumed to be symmetric with respect to the GC. In the following, we briefly review the different methods. \nTable 3\n gives the list of independent recent determinations of R\n0, which we use for obtaining an overall best estimate below.\n", "Recent measurements of distance R\n0 to the Galactic Center\n", "Note: Recent determinations of the distance to the GC, R0, used for weighted averages and in Figure 4.

For Ca+13, no error was given; we estimated one from the metallicity dependence of the red clump giant calibration by Nataf et al. (2013).

Thus R\n0 can be determined by measuring the distance to the SMBH's radiative counterpart, Sgr A\\*. At \u223c8kpc distance, the expected parallax of Sgr A\\* is \n\n. This would be resolvable with very long baseline interferometry (VLBI), but unfortunately the image of Sgr A\\* is broadened by interstellar scattering (e.g., Bower et al. 2004). However, Reid et al. (2009b) measured trigonometric parallaxes of H2O masers in Sgr B2, a molecular cloud complex that they estimated is located \n\n in front of Sgr A\\*.", "A second direct estimate of the distance to the SMBH comes from monitoring proper motions (PMs) and line-of-sight (LOS) velocities for stellar orbits near Sgr A\\* (Eisenhauer et al. 2003, Ghez et al. 2008, Gillessen et al. 2009b, Morris et al. 2012), in particular, for that of star S2, which has by now been followed for a complete orbit around the dynamical center. The main systematic uncertainties are source confusion, tying the SMBH to the astrometric reference frame, and the potential model; relativistic orbit corrections lead to an increase in the value of R\n0 by \u223c0.1kpc (Genzel et al. 2010). See also Gillessen et al. (2009a), who combined the existing two major data sets in a joint analysis.", "The statistical parallax of the nuclear star cluster (NSC) obtained by comparing stellar PMs and LOS velocities has been used as a third direct estimate of R\n0 (Genzel et al. 2000, Trippe et al. 2008, Do et al. 2013). This method has now become accurate enough that projection and finite field-of-view effects in combination with orbital anisotropies need to be modeled (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015).", "VLBI astrometry has provided accurate parallaxes and PMs for over 100 OH, SiO, and methanol masers in high-mass star-formation regions (HMSFRs) in the Galactic disk (Honma et al. 2007, 2012; Reid et al. 2009a, 2014; Sato et al. 2010). Most of these sources are located in the Galactic spiral arms. By fitting a spiral arm model together with a model for Galactic circular rotation to the positions and velocities of the HMSFRs, precise estimates of R\n0 can be obtained together with rotation curve and other parameters (for a different analysis, see Bajkova & Bobylev 2015). Because distances are determined geometrically, no assumptions on tracer luminosities or extinction are necessary. The main remaining systematic uncertainties thus are the assumption of axisymmetric rotation, the detailed parameterization of the rotation curve model, and the treatment of outliers.", "Another long-standing approach is based on analyzing the velocity field near the Solar Circle, using PMs and LOS velocities of various tracers. These methods assume an axisymmetric velocity field and, in some cases, include the perturbing effects of a spiral arm model. In the traditional form, the data are used to solve for the Oort constants A, B (Section 6.4) from the PMs and for 2AR\n0 from the RVs, to finally estimate R\n0 (Mihalas & Binney 1981, Zhu & Shen 2013). Another variation is to use young stars or SFRs assumed to follow circular orbits precisely (Sofue et al. 2011, Bobylev 2013). An analysis less sensitive to the uncertain perturbations from spiral arms and other substructure is that by Sch\u00f6nrich (2012), who uses a large number of stars with PMs and RVs from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (SEGUE) survey (Yanny et al. 2009) to determine R\n0 by combining the rotation signals in the radial and azimuthal velocities for stars within several kiloparsecs from the Sun.", "A promising new method is based on the detailed dynamical modeling of halo streams. Although stream modeling has mostly been used to obtain estimates for the mass and shape of the dark matter halo (see Section 6.3), K\u00fcpper et al. (2015) showed that with accurate modeling R\n0 can also be well constrained as part of a multiparameter fit to detailed density and LOS velocity measurements along the stream.", "\nVanhollebeke et al. (2009) compared predictions from a stellar population model for the Galactic bulge and intervening disk with the observed star counts. They used a density model based on near-IR (NIR) data from Binney et al. (1997) and varied the star-formation history and metallicity distribution of bulge stars. The value of R\n0 from their best-fitting models depends heavily on the magnitudes of red clump stars, showing a close connection to secondary methods.", "There is a long history of secondary R\n0 measurements based on the distance distributions of RR Lyrae stars, Cepheids, Mira stars, red clump giants (RCGs), and globular clusters (Reid 1993). Individual distances are derived from external calibrations of period-luminosity (PL) relations for the variable stars and from horizontal branch (HB) magnitudes for RCGs and globular clusters. The main systematic errors in these methods come from uncertainties in the calibrations but also from the extinction corrections and reddening law and from how the distance distribution in the survey volume is related to the center of the Galaxy.", "RR Lyrae stars, pulsationally unstable HB stars with characteristic absolute magnitudes MI\n=0.2, MK\n=\u22120.5 (Catelan et al. 2004), are the primary distance tracers for old, metal-poor populations. Large numbers of RR Lyrae stars, identified by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE, Udalski et al. 2008) and Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV, Minniti et al. 2010) surveys, were recently used to map out the old metal-poor population in the bulge (Pietrukowicz et al. 2015 and D\u00e9k\u00e1ny et al. 2013, respectively). Individual distances are more accurate by a factor of \u223c2 in the NIR than in optical data, owing to higher precision and reduced metallicity dependence in the PL relation and less sensitivity to reddening. With the large bulge samples the centroid of the distribution can be determined more accurately than it was in earlier work (e.g., Groenewegen et al. 2008, Majaess 2010). On larger Galactic scales, Dambis (2009) calibrated thick disk and halo RR Lyrae populations separately by statistical parallax to then estimate R\n0.", "Type II Cepheids trace old, typically metal-poor populations; they are brighter than RR Lyrae stars but much less numerous. Groenewegen et al. (2008) used NIR data for 39 population II Cepheids in the bulge from the OGLE survey; a related work is by Majaess (2010). Matsunaga et al. (2011, 2013) analyzed 3 classical Cepheids and 16 type II Cepheids from an NIR survey of the inner \n\n in the nuclear bulge.", "\nGroenewegen & Blommaert (2005) obtained a PL relation for 2,691 Mira long-period variables in the OGLE bulge fields, whereas Matsunaga et al. (2009) studied 100 Miras in the nuclear bulge. For these pulsating RGB stars the extinction corrections are smaller, but calibrations from the LMC and globular clusters were needed to estimate R\n0 from these data.", "Since the work by Paczynski & Stanek (1998), RCGs have been recognized as important distance probes in the Galaxy (see Girardi 2016, in this volume). RCGs are He-core\u2013burning stars with a narrow range of luminosities, especially in medium-to-old-age populations such as that in the Galactic bulge. Typical absolute magnitudes are MI\n=\u22120.5, MK\n=\u22121.6, with a dispersion of \u223c0.1\u20130.2 mag, and systematic effects due to age and metallicity variations are relatively small and fairly well understood. Surveys toward the inner Galaxy are frequently done in the NIR to minimize extinction (Babusiaux & Gilmore 2005, Nishiyama et al. 2006) or in the i band (Paczynski & Stanek 1998, Nataf et al. 2013). The K-band studies tend to give slightly shorter distances. Fritz et al. (2011) used RCGs in several NIR bands to determine a distance to the central NSC.", "The centroid of the distance distribution of globular clusters, the basis for the famous early work by Shapley (1918), continues to be used for estimating R\n0 (Bica et al. 2006, Francis & Anderson 2014). These studies are based on the catalog of Harris (2010, and earlier), where individual distances are estimated from HB magnitudes and reddening. The distance distribution of the clusters is somewhat asymmetric, and R\n0 values found are on the low side of the distribution in \nTable 3\n. Systematic effects could be due to missing clusters behind the GC or to errors in the HB magnitudes, e.g., from extinction uncertainties or stellar confusion in crowded cluster fields (Genzel et al. 2010). However, the method provides a rare opportunity to estimate R\n0 from Galactic halo tracers.", "\n\nTable 3\n gives the list of recent determinations that we use for obtaining an overall best estimate for R\n0. For each method, we kept at most three determinations to prevent overweighting often-employed techniques with similar systematic uncertainties; for example, there are many determinations of R\n0 using RCGs as standard candles. We omitted determinations that were later updated by the same group of authors based on improved data but kept independent reanalyses of published data by other authors. We also did not include R\n0 estimates that used priors based on measured values already taken into account (e.g., McMillan 2011).", "\n\nFigure 4\n shows the overall distribution of these 26 measurements with time and the separate distributions for tracers in the GC, bulge, disk, and halo, respectively. To obtain a best estimate for R\n0, we consider weighted means for the total and various subsamples. For any N\nm measurements, we compute (a) the standard error of the weighted mean (SE) and (b) the unbiased standard error of the weighted mean (UE, square root of 1/N\nm times the unbiased weighted sample variance), and following Reid (1993), (c) we consider possible correlations between some of the measurements. These can arise, e.g., because HB or PL calibrations use very similar theoretical models or calibrators or are based on a common LMC distance; because two data sets, although independent, can only be obtained for the same small number of stars; or because several measurements are all based on the assumption that the velocity field near the Solar Circle is axisymmetric. Clearly, some of these correlations have stronger influence than others. For a conservative error evaluation, we retain N\nuc=11 independent measurements for the total sample, and N\nuc=(4, 4, 3, 2) for the separate (GC, bulge, disk and Solar Neighborhood, inner halo, respectively) tracer samples. We note that the sets of methods kept for the different regions are largely independent.

All data samples give very consistent results; the fact that SE and UE generally agree within \u223c20% suggests that the errors given for the individual R\n0 measurements are mostly realistic. Based on the scatter and UUEs of the various sample means, we adopt here our best estimate for the distance to the GC: R\n0=8.2\u00b10.1kpc. This value is significantly lower than the IAU standard (R\n0=8.5kpc).", "The weighted sample means for tracers in the different regions of the Galaxy are R\n0=8.24\u00b10.16[0.13, 0.11]kpc for the GC sample, R\n0=8.17\u00b10.17[0.11, 0.09]kpc for the bulge sample, R\n0=8.16\u00b10.17[0.11, 0.13]kpc for the disk and Solar Neighborhood sample, and R\n0=7.95\u00b10.60[0.60, 0.29]kpc for the inner halo sample. The fact that tracers in the GC, bulge, and disk result in similar estimates for R\n0 within small errors (also for UUE with largely independent respective methods) suggests that the different Galactic components are well centered and, thus, that relative sloshing motions between these components must currently be unimportant. Together with the good alignment of the Milky Way bar and \n\n disk with the Galactic Plane (Section 3.3), this suggests that the inner Milky Way has settled to a well-determined equilibrium state. Even the inner halo tracers on scales of 10\u201320kpc are consistent with having the same GC as the bulge and disk, within \u223c0.6kpc error.", "We anticipate significant improvements in many of these distance measurements based on data from the Gaia satellite, which will provide accurate parallaxes and proper motions for large numbers of Milky Way stars. These data will greatly improve our dynamical understanding of the Galactic disk, but also of the bulge and bar outside highly extincted regions, and lead to much-improved secondary calibrations, e.g., for RR Lyrae stars and RCGs. The direct estimate of R\n0 from stellar orbits around Sgr A\\* is expected to improve steadily as the time base line increases and more orbits can be reliably constrained, especially with accurate astrometric and spectroscopic monitoring of the next close pericenter passage (2018 for the star S2).", "Early estimates of the Sun's vertical position with respect to the Galactic Plane date back to van Tulder's (1942) analysis of stellar catalogs, from which was determined z\n0=14\u00b12 pc toward the North Galactic Pole. In support of the early value, Conti & Vacca (1990) obtained z\n0=15\u00b13 pc using 150 Wolf-Rayet stars within 20 kpc of the Sun. Pioneer 10 observations of the optical background light in the Galaxy indicated z\n0=13\u00b13 pc (Toller 1990), and modeling the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) NIR surface brightness distribution resulted in z\n0=14\u00b14 pc (Binney et al. 1997, Drimmel & Spergel 2001).", "But more expansive studies of the nearby disk show that these are underestimates. Chen et al. (2001) demonstrated the importance of correctly treating the larger-scale parameters of the disk population in such studies, using the SDSS photometric survey. Although the radial scale length is relatively unimportant, a vertically extended population with a well-established scale height is critical. The following estimates are based on either OB stars, open clusters, or optical star counts for a range of stellar populations, and they are broadly consistent: z\n0=24\u00b13 pc (Stothers & Frogel 1974), z\n0=28\u00b15 pc (Pandey et al. 1988), z\n0=21\u00b14 pc (Humphreys & Larsen 1995), z\n0=27\u00b13 pc (Mendez & van Altena 1998), z\n0=28\u00b16 pc (Chen et al. 1999), z\n0=27\u00b14 pc (Chen et al. 2001), and z\n0=24\u00b12 pc (Ma\u00edz-Apell\u00e1niz 2001). Although the last estimate from Hipparcos OB stars has the smallest error, the distribution of young stars may be more sensitive to various perturbations, as illustrated by Gould's belt. Therefore we adopt here the best estimate from the complete SDSS photometric survey, i.e., z\n0=25\u00b15 pc (Juri\u0107 et al. 2008), which captures all these values.", "The Galactic midplane was defined based on the very flat distribution of \n\n gas in the inner Galaxy, with an estimated uncertainty in the position of the Galactic pole of \u223c0.1\u00b0 (Blaauw et al. 1960). Because the Sun was found to lie in the \n\n principal plane within the errors, and the measured offset relative to Population I stars was not considered reliable, the b=0 plane was defined to pass through the Sun and Sgr A (not Sgr A\\*). Because we know now that \n\n, the true Galactic Plane is likely to be slightly inclined relative to the plane b=0. If it is assumed that Sgr A\\* lies precisely in the Galactic Plane (see Section 3.4), the required inclination angle is \u22430.13\u00b0 (see \nFigure 5\n and Goodman et al. 2014). Objects located in the Galactic Plane between the Sun and the GC then appear at slightly negative latitudes. NIR star counts in the inner Galaxy have enough signal-to-noise to detect such offsets. The mean latitude of the peak of RCG counts in the Galactic long bar (see Section 4.3) is indeed found at b\u2243\u22120.12\u00b0, corresponding to an offset of \n\n at \u223c6kpc distance (Wegg et al. 2015). The observed peak latitudes agree with those predicted for the inclined plane to within \n\n or \u223c0.1% of the half-length of the bar (\nFigure 5\n). The Galactic long bar is thus consistent with lying in a tilted midplane passing through Sgr A\\* and the point \n\n below the Sun to within \u223c0.1%.

(2010) for recent reviews. IR studies of the motions of gas clouds in the Sgr A region first indicated a central point mass of several 106M\u2299 (e.g., Lacy et al. 1980). Later, PM measurements of stars in the dense NSC showed evidence for a Keplerian increase of the stellar velocity dispersion to several 100kms\u22121 at \n\n from the GC, corresponding to a central mass of \u223c2\u20133\u00d7106M\u2299 (Eckart & Genzel 1997, Ghez et al. 1998). Currently, from accurate LOS velocities and astrometric measurements with adaptive optics, stellar orbits have been determined for some 30 of the so-called S stars in the central arcsecond, including one complete 15.8-year orbit for the star S2. All orbits are well fitted by a common enclosed mass and elliptical orbit focal point. From multiorbit fits, rescaled to R\n0=8.2kpc, the total enclosed mass is M\n\u2022=4.3\u00d7106M\u2299 (Ghez et al. 2008) and M\n\u2022=4.2\u00d7106M\u2299 (Gillessen et al. 2009b), and M\n\u2022=(4.20\u00b10.36)\u00d7106M\u2299 from a joint analysis of the combined Very Large Telescope (VLT) and Keck data (Gillessen et al. 2009a). The error given is combined statistical and systematic and is expected to improve steadily with increasing time base line of the measurements; it has an important contribution from a degeneracy between M\n\u2022 and R\n0.", "Therefore, external constraints on R\n0 reduce the range of black hole mass allowed by the orbit measurements. Combining with their measurement of the NSC statistical parallax, Chatzopoulos et al. (2015) found M\n\u2022=(4.23\u00b10.14)\u00d7106M\u2299. Using instead the overall best R\n0=8.2\u00b10.1kpc from Section 3.2, the mass of the black hole becomes M\n\u2022=(4.2\u00b10.2\u00d7106)M\u2299. This corresponds to a Schwarzschild radius of \n\n and a dynamical radius of influence of \n\n, where the interior mass of the NSC M(r<r\ninfl)=2M\n\u2022 (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015). The inferred mass is also consistent with the orbital roulette value obtained by Beloborodov et al. (2006) from the stellar motions in the clockwise disk of young stars around Sgr A\\*. For M\n\u2022=4.2\u00d7106M\u2299 and a bulge velocity dispersion of \u03c3\u2243113kms\u22121 (Section 4.2.3), the Milky Way falls below the best-fitting (M\n\u2022\u2212\u03c3) relation for elliptical galaxies and classical bulges by a factor of \u223c5\u20136 (Kormendy & Ho 2013, Saglia et al. 2016).", "From the orbit fit, any extended mass distribution within the orbit of S2 can contribute no more than 10% of the enclosed mass. The S2 star has approached the central mass within \n\n at pericenter, requiring a minimum interior mass density of \n\n. This is so large that one can rule out any known form of compact object other than a black hole (Reid 2009, Genzel et al. 2010). From matching the positions of SiO maser stars visible in both the NIR and the radio bands, the positions of the compact mass and the radio source Sgr A\\* have been shown to coincide within \n\n (Reid et al. 2003, Gillessen et al. 2009b). The size of Sgr A\\* in millimeter radio observations is \n\n (Shen et al. 2005, Doeleman et al. 2008). These facts taken together make it highly likely that Sgr A\\* is the radiative counterpart of the black hole at the center of the Galaxy.", "The apparent PM of Sgr A\\* relative to a distant quasar (J1745-283) has been measured with great precision using VLBI (Reid & Brunthaler 2004, Reid 2008). The PM perpendicular to the Galactic Plane is entirely consistent with the reflex motion of the vertical peculiar velocity of the Sun, with residual \u22120.4\u00b10.9kms\u22121, suggesting strongly that the SMBH is essentially at rest at the GC. Indeed the Brownian motion of the SMBH due to perturbations from the stars orbiting inside its gravitational influence radius is expected to be \u223c0.2kms\u22121 (Merritt et al. 2007). On the assumption that Sgr A\\* is motionless at the GC, its measured PM in the Galactic Plane determines the total angular velocity of the Sun with high accuracy: \u03a9\ng,\u2299=30.24\u00b10.12kms\u22121kpc\u22121.

NSCs are commonly seen in the centers of disk galaxies, and many contain an active galactic nucleus and thus an SMBH (e.g., B\u00f6ker 2010).

[Erratum]", "The structure and dynamics of the NSC must be studied in the IR because of the very high extinction toward the GC (AK\n\u223c2.6 mag, AV\n\u223c40 mag; Fritz et al. 2011, Nishiyama et al. 2008). Recent analysis of Spitzer/IRAC 3.6-\n\n and 4.5-\n\n images (Sch\u00f6del et al. 2014a) has shown that the old NSC is centered on Sgr A\\* and point-symmetric, and it is flattened along the Galactic Plane with minor-to-major projected axis ratio q=0.71\u00b10.02. Chatzopoulos et al. (2015) obtain q=0.73\u00b10.04 from fitting K-band star counts; they also show that NSC dynamics requires a flattened star cluster with an axis ratio consistent with this value. The NSC radial density profile is discussed in these papers and by Fritz et al. (2016). When fitting the 4.5-\n\n data with a S\u00e9rsic profile, Sch\u00f6del et al. (2014a) obtain a total 4.5-\n\n luminosity L\n4.5,NSC=(4.1\u00b10.4)\u00d7107L\u2299 and a spherical half-light radius of \n\n.", "The dynamical mass within 100 arcsec \n\n is (8.9\u00b11)\u00d7106M\u2299 (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015); thus M/L\n4.5=0.44\u00b10.06M\u2299/L\n4.5,\u2299, and the total mass of the NSC for the S\u00e9rsic model is M\nNSC=(1.8\u00b10.3)\u00d7107M\u2299. An additional error in M\nNSC not accounted for in this estimate comes from the fact that the surface density profile of the NSC goes below that of the much larger, surrounding nuclear stellar disk at projected Rs\n\u2273100 arcsec, making its outer density profile uncertain (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015). The rotation properties and velocity dispersions were measured by Trippe et al. (2008) and Fritz et al. (2016) from stellar PMs and LOS velocities, and by Feldmeier et al. (2014) from NIR integrated spectra. The NSC is approximately described by an isotropic rotator model, with slightly slower rotation (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015). There are indications for a local kinematic misalignment in the LOS velocities but not in the PMs (Feldmeier et al. 2014, Fritz et al. 2016), which, if confirmed, might indicate some contribution to the NSC mass by infalling star clusters (Antonini et al. 2012); this needs further study. Another unsolved problem is the apparent core in the NSC density profile (Buchholz et al. 2009); this might indicate that the NSC is not fully relaxed, consistent with the relaxation time estimated as \n\n throughout the NSC (Merritt 2013).", "The old NSC is embedded in a nuclear stellar disk (NSD) that dominates the 3D stellar mass distribution outside \u223c\n\n (Chatzopoulos et al. 2015) and within \u223c200\u2013\n\n (Launhardt et al. 2002). From star counts, its vertical density profile is near-exponential with scale height \n\n (Nishiyama et al. 2013). This confirms an earlier analysis of COBE data by Launhardt et al. (2002) that covers a larger area but with lower resolution. The projected density profile along the major axis (|l|) is approximately a power law \u221d|l|\u22120.3 out to \n\n; thereafter it drops steeply toward the NSD's outer edge at \n\n, approximately \u221d|l|\u22122. The axis ratio of the NSD inferred in these papers from the star counts and NIR data is \u223c3:1 at small radii and \u223c5:1 on the largest scale. The total stellar mass estimated by Launhardt et al. (2002) is M\nNSD=(1.4\u00b10.6)\u00d7109M\u2299, of order 10% of the mass of the bulge. The rotation of the NSD has been seen in OH/IR stars and SiO masers (Lindqvist et al. 1992, Habing et al. 2006) and with Apache Point Observatory Galaxy Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) stars (Sch\u00f6nrich et al. 2015), with an observed gradient \u2243150kms\u22121deg\u22121 and an estimated rotation velocity of \u2248120kms\u22121 at \n\n. These data suggest a dynamical mass on the lower side of the estimated stellar mass range. The NSD is likely related to past star formation in the zone of x\n2-orbits near the center of the barred potential (e.g., Molinari et al. 2011). Clearly, understanding the NSD better is relevant for the evolution of the Galactic bulge and probably also for the growth of the SMBH, and further information about its kinematics and stellar population would be important. \nFigure 6\n illustrates this still enigmatic Galactic component together with the NSC.\n", "", "\n Figure 6\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "For many years, the Galactic bulge was considered to be a structure built through mergers early in the formation of the Galaxy, now called a classical bulge. Particularly the old ages of bulge stars inferred from color-magnitude diagrams supported this view (Ortolani et al. 1995, Clarkson et al. 2008). The NIR photometry with the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment instrument on board the COBE satellite first established the boxy nature of the bulge (Weiland et al. 1994, Binney et al. 1997), later confirmed by the 2MASS star count map (Skrutskie et al. 2006). Recent star count data have unambiguously established that the bulk of the bulge stars are part of a so-called box/peanut or b/p bulge structure representing the inner, 3D part of the Galactic bar (McWilliam & Zoccali 2010, Nataf et al. 2010, Wegg & Gerhard 2013), consistent with the observed cylindrical rotation (Kunder et al. 2012, Ness et al. 2013b). This corroborates long-standing evidence for a barred potential in the bulge region from noncircular motions seen in \n\n and CO longitude-velocity (lv) diagrams (Binney et al. 1991, Englmaier & Gerhard 1999). The central parts of the Galaxy also contain the dense NSD, and some have argued for a separate, 200-pc-scale nuclear bar (Alard 2001, Rodriguez-Fernandez & Combes 2008). Finally, the peak in the density of the inner stellar halo is found in this region as well. Disentangling these various components clearly requires the best data possible. Results to date and open issues are summarized below. For more extensive reviews of the Galactic bulge see Rich (2013), Gonzalez & Gadotti (2016), and Shen & Li (2016).", "A large fraction of the bulge stars follow a rotating, barred, b/p-shaped bulge with exponential density distribution, similar to the inner 3D part of an evolved N-body bar. The best available structural information for the dominant bulge population comes from large samples of RCGs, for which individual distances can be determined to \u223c10% accuracy. These He-core-burning stars have a narrow range of absolute magnitudes and colors, \u03c3(K\ns)\u22430.17 and \n\n\u2013K\ns)\u22430.05, and are predicted to trace the stellar population within 10% for metallicities in the range [0.02,1.5] solar (Salaris & Girardi 2002). In the color-magnitude diagram, RCGs appear spread because of distance, reddening, age (by \u223c0.03Gyr\u22121 in K\ns at age 10Gyr), and metallicity [by \n\n for the measured bulge metallicity distribution]. Among the 25,500 stars of the Abundances and Radial Velocity Galactic Origins Survey (ARGOS), RCGs are prominent down to [Fe/H] =\u22121.0, which comprises \u223c95% of their sample (Ness et al. 2013a); i.e., RCGs are representative for most of the bulge stars.", "Using \u223c8 million RCGs from the VVV survey (Minniti et al. 2010) over the region \u221210\u00b0\u2264l\u226410\u00b0, \u221210\u00b0\u2264b\u22645\u00b0, Wegg & Gerhard (2013) obtained RCG LOS density distributions for \u223c300 sightlines outside the most crowded region |b|<1\u00b0 and combined these to a 3D map of the bulge RCG density assuming eightfold triaxial symmetry (\nFigure 7a\n\n). As shown in the figure, root-mean-square (rms) variations between eightfold symmetric points in the final map are indeed small; there is no evidence for asymmetries in the volume of the RCG measurement (\u00b12.2\u00d7\u00b11.4\u00d7\u00b11.2kpc). The RCG bulge is strongly barred, with a face-on projected axis ratio of \u223c1:2.1 for isophotes reaching \u223c2kpc along the major axis; it has a strong b/p shape viewed side-on and a boxy shape as seen from the Sun, consistent with the earlier COBE and 2MASS data. Unsharp masking (Portail et al. 2015b) results in a strong off-centered X-shape structure (\nFigure 7b\n\n), similar to some galaxies in the sample of Bureau et al. (2006); see also Nataf et al.

The bar angle between the major axis and the Sun-GC line found by Wegg & Gerhard (2013) is \u03d5bp=27\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0, with most of the error being systematic. This is consistent with earlier parametric determinations from OGLE i-band RCG star counts (29\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0, Cao et al. 2013; 25\u00b0\u00b12\u00b0, Rattenbury et al. 2007; 20\u00b0\u201330\u00b0, Stanek et al. 1997), from nonparametric inversion of 2MASS red giant star counts (20\u00b0\u201335\u00b0, L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2005), and from modeling the asymmetry of the COBE NIR photometry (\u223c25\u00b0\u00b110\u00b0; Dwek et al. 1995, Binney et al. 1997, Freudenreich 1998, Bissantz & Gerhard 2002). The global bulge axis ratios obtained with parametric star count models are typically (1 : 0.4 : 0.3), similar to those found from modeling the COBE data. However, it is clear from \nFigure 7\n that a single vertical axis ratio does not capture the shape of the b/p bulge. \nFigure 7c\n\n shows that the density distributions inside \u223c1kpc are nearly exponential, with scale lengths (hx\n : hy\n : hz\n) = (0.70 : 0.44 : 0.18) kpc and axis ratios (10 : 6.3 : 2.6) (Wegg & Gerhard 2013). Further down the major axis, hz\n/hx\n increases to \u223c0.5 at x\u223c1.5kpc, where the X shape is maximal, and then decreases rapidly outward.", "The structure of the inner Galactic disk between the NSD and R\u223c2kpc is not well known due to heavy extinction and crowding. Observations of maser stars and VVV Cepheids indicate a barred disk of young stars (Habing et al. 2006, D\u00e9k\u00e1ny et al. 2015). The cold kinematics of young bar stars has likely been seen in APOGEE LOS velocity histograms (Aumer & Sch\u00f6nrich 2015). The short hz\n=180-pc vertical scale height in the bulge is perhaps indicative of a central disk-like, high-density, pseudo-bulge structure, as is seen in many early- and late-type b/p bulge galaxies (Bureau et al. 2006, \n Kormendy & Barentine 2010)\n . NIR RCG star counts at b=\u00b11\u00b0 have confirmed a structural change in the RCG longitude profiles at \n\n (Nishiyama et al. 2005, Gonzalez et al. 2011a, Wegg & Gerhard 2013). This has been interpreted by means of an N-body model in terms of a rounder, more nearly axisymmetric central parts of the b/p bulge (Gerhard & Martinez-Valpuesta 2012). As predicted by the model, the transition at \n\n is confined to a few degrees from the Galactic Plane (Gonzalez et al. 2012).", "The nuclear bulge within \n\n is dominated by the NSD. Based on longitudinal asymmetries in a map of projected 2MASS star counts Alard (2001) presented indications for a 200-\n\n scale nuclear bar separate from the b/p bulge-bar. However, the large-scale Galactic bar by itself leads to similar inverted asymmetries in the center, just by projection (Gerhard & Martinez-Valpuesta 2012), so the observed asymmetries are not a tell-tale signature. Unfortunately, the distance resolution of the RCG is not sufficient to investigate the LOS structure of a tilted nuclear bar. Thus the most promising tests appear to be with models of the nuclear gas flow (Rodriguez-Fernandez & Combes 2008), but this requires understanding the larger-scale properties of the gas flow better (see Section 4.4), which influence the nuclear gas flow. Further studies in the IR, both photometric and spectroscopic, are clearly needed to shed more light on the inner bulge.", "Bulges in several disk galaxy-formation models have been found to harbor a rapid early starburst component, as well as a second component that forms later after disk build-up and instabilities and/or minor mergers (Samland & Gerhard 2003, Obreja et al. 2013). The former could be associated with a classical bulge even in the absence of a significant early merger-built bulge. The Milky Way bulge has a well-established vertical metallicity gradient (Zoccali et al. 2008, Johnson et al. 2011, Gonzalez et al. 2013) that has often been taken as the signature of a dissipatively formed classical bulge (see Pipino et al. 2008). However, because violent relaxation is inefficient during the bar and buckling instabilities, preexisting metallicity gradients, such that stars with lower binding energies have lower metallicities, would survive as outward metallicity gradients in the final b/p bulge (Martinez-Valpuesta & Gerhard 2013, Di Matteo et al. 2014). Recent spectroscopic surveys have attributed the vertical metallicity gradient to a superposition of several metallicity components whose relative contributions change with latitude (Babusiaux et al. 2010, Ness et al. 2013a). Hence the signature of a classical bulge must be found with more detailed kinematic and chemical observations.", "The mean LOS rotation velocities of bulge stars are nearly independent of latitude, showing cylindrical rotation as is common in barred bulges. First found with planetary nebulas (Beaulieu et al. 2000), this was shown conclusively with Bulge Radial Velocity Assay (BRAVA) (Kunder et al. 2012), ARGOS (Ness et al. 2013b), and GIRAFFE Inner Bulge Survey (GIBS; Zoccali et al. 2014). Rotation velocities reached at l\u223c10\u00b0 are \u223c75kms\u22121.

Based on the dynamical model of Portail et al. (2015b; see Section 4.2.4) mass-weighted velocity dispersions inside the bulge half-mass radius are (\u03c3b\n\nx\n, \u03c3b\n\ny\n, \u03c3b\n\nz\n)\u2248(135, 105, 96)kms\u22121, and the rms is \u03c3b\nrms\u2248113kms\u22121, to within 3kms\u22121.", "The ARGOS survey mapped the kinematics for different metallicities, showing that higher/lower metallicity stars have lower/higher velocity dispersions. Soto et al. (2007) and Babusiaux et al. (2010) found differences between the vertex deviations of metal-rich and metal-poor bulge stars and argue for the existence of two main bulge stellar populations, of which only the more metal-rich one follows the bar. Rojas-Arriagada et al. (2014) find two about equally numerous, metal-rich and metal-poor components in the metallicity distribution of their fields, whereas Ness et al. (2013a,b) find evidence for five populations. The metal-rich components trace the X shape and hence the barred bulge, but the origin of the metal-poor stars ([Fe/H]\u2272\u22120.5) is currently debated. They could represent an old bulge formed through early mergers or a thick disk component participating in the instability together with the inner stellar halo (e.g., Babusiaux et al. 2010, Di Matteo et al. 2014).", "Large numbers of RR Lyrae stars found in the OGLE and VVV bulge surveys have shown that the most metal-poor ([Fe/H] =\u22121.0\u00b10.2), old population does not participate in the b/p bulge (D\u00e9k\u00e1ny et al. 2013, Pietrukowicz et al. 2015), consistent with the ARGOS result that only stars with [Fe/H] \u22730.5 participate in the split red clump (Ness et al. 2012). The RR Lyrae stars show no significant rotation (Kunder et al. 2016). By contrast, the ARGOS stars with [Fe/H]<\u22121 rotate still fairly rapidly; whether they could be stars from the stellar halo or a low-mass classical bulge spun up by the b/p bulge (Saha et al. 2012) or whether they could include a component of thick disk stars must still be checked in detail.", "In summary, it is unclear at this time whether the Milky Way contains any classical bulge at all\u2014comparing N-body-simulated b/p bulge models to the BRAVA data, Shen et al. (2010) found that the cylindrical rotation in the Galactic bulge could be matched by their models only if the initial models contained a classical bulge with \u22728% of the initial disk mass (\u227225% of the final bulge mass), and none was needed. However, there is strong evidence from structural and kinematic properties that the major part of the Galactic bulge was built from the disk through evolutionary processes similar to those observed in galaxy evolution simulations, as is also inferred for many external galaxies (so-called secular evolution; Kormendy 2013, Sellwood 2014).", "The stellar mass of the bulge can be estimated from a photometric model combined with a stellar population model.

(2016) obtained a projected mass of 2.0\u00b10.3\u00d71010M\u2299 from scaling the measured mass function in a small bulge field to the whole bulge using RCGs. The stellar mass corresponds to the dynamical mass only if the contribution of dark matter in the bulge region is unimportant.", "The dynamical mass in the bulge can be determined from either gas kinematics in the bulge region or stellar kinematics combined with a dynamical model. For a barred bulge, simple rotation curve analysis does not apply, and analysis of the full gas velocity field requires hydrodynamical models (see Section 4.4). Stellar dynamical models require a well-determined tracer density, i.e., an NIR luminosity or tracer density distribution. Furthermore, because the dominant part of the Galactic bulge is the inner b/p part of the Galactic bar, the result depends somewhat on the spatial region defined as the bulge.", "\nZhao et al.

The data can be fit well by models with a range of dark-to-stellar mass ratios. Comparing the implied total surface mass density with the COBE surface brightness and stellar population models, a Salpeter IMF for a 10-\n\n-old population can be ruled out, predicting significantly more mass than is dynamically allowed. For an IMF between those of Kroupa (2001), Chabrier (2003), and Zoccali et al. (2000), 10\u201340% of the mass in the bulge region would be required to be in dark matter. Recently Calamida et al.

There is also evidence that b/p bulges in external galaxies are embedded in longer, thinner bars (Bureau et al. 2006).

With Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) mid-IR star counts, which are less affected by dust than K-band data, Benjamin et al.

They found that the Galactic bar extends to l\u223c25\u00b0 at |b|\u223c5\u00b0 from the Galactic Plane and to l\u223c30\u00b0 at lower latitudes. Their long bar has an angle to the LOS of 28\u00b0\u201333\u00b0, which is consistent with the bar angle inferred for the bulge at |l|<10\u00b0. The vertical scale height of the RCG stars decreases continuously from the b/p bulge to the long bar. Thus the central b/p bulge appears to be the vertical extension of a longer, flatter bar, similar to that seen in external galaxies and N-body models.", "These recent results are based on a larger and more uniform data base and on a more uniform analysis than the earlier work on the long bar, using cross-checked star-by-star extinction corrections and a statistical rather than color-magnitude-diagram-based selection of RCG stars. This leads to smaller errors in the RCG magnitude distributions and reduced scatter between neighboring fields, particularly near the Galactic Plane.

Stars in this component have an estimated vertical velocity dispersion of \u03c3\nz\n\u224320\u201330kms\u22121 and should be younger than the thin component. However, to have formed RCGs they must have ages of at least \n\n, but star-forming galaxies have a strong bias toward ages around \n\n (Salaris & Girardi 2002). Such a younger bar component could arise from star formation toward the bar end or from disk stars captured by the bar.", "The dynamical mass of the long bar component has not yet been determined. The stellar mass was estimated by Wegg et al. (2015) from the RCG density using isochrones and a Kroupa IMF. This resulted in a total nonaxisymmetric mass for the thin bar component of M\ntlb\u22436\u20138\u00d7109M\u2299, assuming a 10-Gyr-old, \u03b1-enhanced population, and M\nslb\u223c3\u00d7109M\u2299 for the superthin component, assuming a constant past SFR. Owing to its 5-kpc half-length and its total mass of \u223c1010M\u2299, the long bar may have quite some impact on the dynamics of the Galactic disk inside the Solar Circle, particularly on the gas flow and the spiral arms but perhaps also on surface density and scale-length measurements in the disk (see \nFigure 10\n). In Section 4.4 below, we summarize constraints on the bar's corotation radius, which must be larger than R\nlb.", "The pattern speed \u03a9b of the b/p bulge and bar, or equivalently its corotation radius R\nCR, has great importance for the dynamics of the bar and surrounding disk. Despite a number of different attacks on measuring \u03a9b its value is currently not accurately known. An upper limit comes from determining the length of the bar and assuming that, like in external galaxies, the Galactic bar is a fast bar, i.e., \n\n (Aguerri et al. 2003, 2015). Here the 1.0 lower limit is based on the fact that theoretically bars cannot extend beyond their corotation radius because the main x\n1-orbit family supporting the bar becomes unstable (Contopoulos 1980, Athanassoula 1992). The length of the long bar from star counts is R\nlb\u22435.0\u00b10.2kpc, and the length of the thin bar component alone is R\ntlb\u22434.6\u00b10.3kpc (Wegg et al. 2015); thus a strong lower limit is R\nCR=4.3kpc, and a more likely range is R\nCR=5.0\u20137.0 kpc, or \u03a9b\u223c34\u2013\n\n for \u03980=238kms\u22121=constant (Section 6.4).", "Early determinations appeared to give rather high values of \u03a9b. The most direct method applied a modified version of the Tremaine-Weinberg continuity argument to a complete sample of OH/IR stars in the inner Galaxy (Debattista et al. 2002), giving \u03a9b=59\u00b15\u00b110 (sys) \n\n for (R\n0, \u03980)=(8kpc, 220kms\u22121) but depending sensitively on the radial motion of the local standard of rest (LSR).", "More frequently, the pattern speed of the bar has been estimated from hydrodynamic simulations comparing the gas flow with observed Galactic CO and \n\n\nlv-diagrams. These simulations are sensitive to the gravitational potential, and generally reproduce a number of characteristic features in the lv-plot, but none reproduces all observed features equally well. Consequently, the derived pattern speeds depend somewhat on the gas features emphasized. Englmaier & Gerhard (1999) and Bissantz et al. (2003) estimated 55\u2013\n\n (R\nCR=3.4\u00b10.3 kpc), matching the terminal velocity curve, spiral arm tangents, and ridges in the lv-plot. Fux (1999) obtained \n\n (R\nCR=4\u20134.5 kpc) from a comparison with various reference features in the CO lv-plot; Weiner & Sellwood (1999) obtained \n\n (R\nCR=5.0 kpc) from matching the extreme \n\n velocity contour; Rodriguez-Fernandez & Combes (2008) obtained 30\u2013\n\n and R\nCR=5\u20137 kpc matching to the Galactic spiral arm pattern. The most recent analysis based on a range of potential parameters is that by Sormani et al. (2015). They conclude that overall a pattern speed of \n\n corresponding to R\nCR=5.6kpc matches best the combined constraints from the terminal velocity envelope, the central velocity peaks, and the spiral arm traces in the lv-diagram (for R\n0, \u03980=8kpc, 220kms\u22121).", "Stellar dynamical models of the Galactic b/p bulge also depend on \u03a9b and give estimated ranges for its value. Shen et al. (2010) and Long et al. (2012) find \n\n for the same N-body model matched to the BRAVA kinematic data. The recent models of Portail et al. (2015b) fitted additionally to the RCG density from Wegg & Gerhard (2013) give values in the range of \u03a9b\u223c25\u2013\n\n, placing corotation in the range of R\nCR>7.2kpc (for R\n0, \u03980=8.3kpc, 220kms\u22121). These values could depend somewhat on the still uncertain gravitational potential in the long bar region.", "A final method is based on the interpretation of star streams observed in the distribution of stellar velocities in the Solar Neighborhood as due to resonant orbit families near the outer Lindblad resonance of the bar (Kalnajs 1991, Dehnen 2000). Dehnen (2000) estimates \u03a9b=(1.85\u00b10.15)\u03980/R\n0 [\n\n for (R\n0, \u03980)=(8kpc, 220kms\u22121)]. Minchev et al. (2007) find \u03a9b=(1.87\u00b10.04)\u03980/R\n0 (\n\n). Chakrabarty (2007) and others argue that spiral arm perturbations need to be included, finding R\n0/R\nCR\u22432.1\u00b10.1 and \n\n. The latest analysis of the Hercules stream by Antoja et al. (2014) gives R\n0/R\nCR\u2243(1.83\u00b10.02), \n\n, and R\nCR=4.49\u00b10.05kpc when rescaled to (R\n0, \u03980)=(8.2kpc, 238kms\u22121). This is the current most precise measurement but is model dependent; it would place corotation just inside the thin long bar and clearly within the superthin bar. It is just compatible with all the uncertainties; alternatively it may suggest that the Hercules stream has a different origin than the outer Lindblad resonance.", "Considering all these determinations and the systematic uncertainties, we finally adopt a range of R\nCR=4.5\u20137kpc, or \n\n for our best estimated (R\n0, \u03980)=(8.2kpc, 238kms\u22121). More accurate dynamical modeling of a wider set of stellar kinematical data, in particular from Gaia, is expected to narrow down this rather wide range in the coming years (Hunt & Kawata 2014).", "Our vantage point from within the Galaxy allows us to obtain vast amounts of unique information about galactic processes but this detail comes at a price. The Solar System falls between two spiral arms (\nFigure 11\n) at a small vertical distance from the Galactic Plane (Section 3.3). The thinness of the disk gives a fairly unobstructed view of the stellar halo and the outer bulge. But deprojecting the extended disk remains fraught with difficulty because of source confusion and interstellar extinction. Our off-center position at the Solar Radius is a distinct advantage except that it complicates any attempt to learn about large-scale, nonaxisymmetries across the Galaxy. We now have a better understanding of the structure of the inner Galaxy (Section 4), but the outer disk remains largely mysterious (see Section 5.5 below).\n", "", "\n Figure 11\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Over the past decade, we have learned much about the Galactic stellar disk, but few parameters are known with any precision. The local surface density and the vertical density profile of the summed disk component (gas, stars, background dark matter) are known to high certainty (Section 5.4.1). But although photometric scale lengths are well established in external galaxies (Lange et al. 2015), the radial scale lengths and vertical scale heights of the Galactic thin and thick disks are uncertain. Unlike for the inner Galactic bar/bulge region (Section 4), we are not able to present a fully consistent picture for the disk at this time, although the key parameters are discussed and values recommended. Major reviews of the stellar disk include those by Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn (2002), Ivezi\u0107 et al. (2012), and Rix & Bovy (2013); the gaseous disk is discussed at length by Kalberla & Dedes (2008).", "One of the most interesting developments is the recognition of a Galactic thick disk that is distinct from the dominant thin disk through its unique chemistry (e.g., Bensby 2014, Hawkins et al. 2015, Masseron & Gilmore 2015), in addition to its older age and higher elevation. Originally recognized by Gilmore & Reid (1983), such disks appear to be ubiquitous in the local Universe (Yoachim & Dalcanton 2006). In external galaxies, deep stellar photometry reveals that the thick and thin disks have approximately equal scale lengths (e.g., Comer\u00f3n et al. 2012). Whether these old red disks have a distinct formation history or have continuous properties with the old thin disk is unclear. Several authors have presented models in which the Galactic thick disk arises from a combination of stellar migration and/or flaring of the old disk stars, such that its history is tied to the formation of the thin disk even though its mean metallicity may be different (e.g., Sch\u00f6nrich & Binney 2009, Loebman et al. 2011, Minchev et al. 2015). In view of the distinct chemical signature of the thick disk, it is worthwhile to quantify its properties separately from the thin disk regardless of its origins.", "Early studies of the Galaxy would fit simple models to the projected star counts in a given optical or IR band (e.g., Bahcall & Soneira 1980). Without distance information, these authors found that a variety of models fit the data (including many combinations of two exponential functions) due to degeneracies between structural parameters. Historically, fits to star counts with vertical distance z have used a variety of functions but, today, the exponential function is widely used to match both disk photometry (Patterson 1940) and the peaked star counts close to the plane (Wainscoat et al. 1989).", "By the end of the decade, we can expect accurate distances for millions of stars from the ESA Gaia survey. But for now, we are dependent on photometric parallaxes for determining stellar distances, which have a long history in their application to Milky Way structure (Gilmore & Reid 1983, Kuijken & Gilmore 1989, Chen et al. 2001). The term parallax echoes the use of nearby bright stars with established trigonometric parallaxes to calibrate the absolute magnitude\u2013distance relation (e.g., Eggen 1951). (The term spectroscopic parallax refers to the spectral classification used to determine the absolute magnitude, rather than photometric colors.)", "All photometric studies find an exponential scale height z\nt=220\u2013450 pc for the dominant old thin disk at the Sun's location. The low extreme comes from multiband optical studies (e.g., Ojha 2001) that include stellar populations with a wide range of (especially younger) ages. These surveys suffer from various biases that tend to suppress the scale height (see below). The upper extreme is from early M dwarf studies in which confusion with halo M giants can lead to overestimates of the scale height (Reid 1993, Gould et al. 1996). M dwarfs, which account for roughly half of all stars in the Solar Neighborhood (Section 5.4.3), trace the underlying total stellar mass. The much larger M star survey by Juri\u0107 et al. (2008), discussed below, finds z\nt\u2248300 pc (to within 20%) after various biases are accounted for. This mid-range value is largely unchanged since Schmidt's early determination (Schmidt 1963).", "An improvement is to use two or more well-calibrated optical bands to compare the magnitude counts in different color bins. This led to Gilmore & Reid's identification of the thick disk after constructing the V and i luminosity functions for stars at or above the main-sequence turnoff (MSTO) at different distances from the plane and by ruling out biases due to interstellar extinction or metallicity gradients perpendicular to the disk. This classic study observed 12,500 stars toward the South Galactic Pole brighter than I=18 and provided the first reliable stellar densities vertical to the Galactic Plane; their density profile continues to compare well with modern derivations (Section 5.4.1). They estimated z\nt\u2248300 pc in line with modern estimates, and z\nT\u223c1, 450 pc, somewhat higher than what is believed today.", "After 2000, the quality and angular extent of photometric data from wide-field CCDs improved dramatically (e.g., Finlator et al. 2000). The internal accuracies of the multiband data led to improved estimates of photometric parallax and metallicity (robust in the range of \u22122 < [Fe/H] < 0) in wide-field surveys (see Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2012). Notably, Siegel et al. (2002) observed select Kapteyn fields to derive photometric distances for 130, 000 stars. They stressed the need to correct for unresolved multiplicities (of order 50%); otherwise, stellar distances (and therefore scale heights) are underestimated. The lower scale height estimates in the past are likely to have been underestimated for this reason. Even for old stars, there is some scale height variation among dwarfs: 280\u2013300 pc for early-type dwarfs (5.8<MR\n<6.8) rising to 350 pc for late-type dwarfs (8.8<MR\n<10.2). When averaging over old dwarfs, before and after the correction, they obtain z\nt\u2248290 pc and z\nt\u2248350 pc, respectively; for the thick disk, they find z\nT=700\u20131, 000 pc and z\nT=900\u20131, 200 pc, respectively. (These are derived from exponential models; sech2 fits lead to 10% smaller values after correction for the factor of two difference in scale height between the exponential and sech2 functions.)", "For our subsequent disk analysis, we focus on the SDSS ugriz northern sky survey with its excellent photometric quality (\u223c0.02 mag). With photometric data for 48 million stars over 6,500 deg2, this data set is the largest to date with precise color-magnitude versus metallicity relations made possible using cluster calibrations across the sky (Finlator et al. 2000, Chen et al. 2001). This survey gave rise to three major studies based on photometric parallax (Juri\u0107 et al. 2008), photometric metallicities (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2008), and kinematics (Bond et al. 2010) discussed in the next two sections.", "\nJuri\u0107 et al. (2008) exploit the faint magnitude limit (r\u223c22 mag) of the SDSS survey and target two groups of M dwarfs: a late M group with 1.0<r\u2013i<1.4 and an early M/late K group with 0.65<r\u2013i<1.0. The late M group is favored because it is less sensitive to the halo population and to local substructure. At the Solar Circle, their formal model fits for both disk components are z\nt\u2248245 pc and z\nT\u2248740 pc, respectively, before correction for multiplicity and closer to z\nt\u2248300 pc and z\nT\u2248900 pc, respectively, after correction, both with 20% uncertainty. These constitute the most reliable values to date because of the SDSS coverage in galactic longitude and improved photometric distances over the required physical scales. Although the SDSS and 2MASS surveys are widely used in star count analyses, neither survey is ideal for determining the properties of the thick and thin disks simultaneously. Rather than cross-matching sources common to both catalogs (e.g., Finlator et al. 2000), future studies will need to combine both surveys in order to provide better input catalogs (Robin et al. 2014).", "Although the thick disk was originally identified through stellar photometry, decompositions based on star counts are subject to degeneracies (Section 5.1.3). We include a limited discussion of the photometric estimates because of the historical context and because the thin disk values are broadly correct. But we stress that the thick and thin disk components are better separated through their distinct stellar chemistry. Numerous studies (Section 5.2) exploit either stellar abundances based on multiband photometry (large samples, large measurement errors) or spectroscopy (smaller samples, smaller errors).", "Although vertical scale heights are well determined at optical and IR wave bands due to the low extinction toward the poles, this is not true of disk radial scale lengths. We have analyzed 130 refereed papers on disk parameters, with scale lengths ranging from 1.8 to 6.0 kpc. In order to combat the effects of extinction, for observations that preceded the SDSS survey, the IR point source measurements are the most reliable because they tell a consistent story. This is particularly true for studies that target a broad extent in galactic longitude and observe in the anticenter direction to ensure they are less influenced by the presence of the central bar or by substructure. These include the Space Shuttle experiment (Kent et al. 1991), the Deep Near-Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky (DENIS; Ruphy et al. 1996) in the anticenter direction, COBE/FIRAS (Far Infrared Absolute Spectrophotometer; Freudenreich 1998, Drimmel & Spergel 2001), 2MASS (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2002, Cabrera-Lavers et al. 2005, Reyl\u00e9 et al. 2009), and GLIMPSE (Benjamin et al. 2005). A statistical analysis of the main papers (15 in all) on this topic leads to R\nt=2.6\u00b10.5 kpc, which includes the highest value (3.9 kpc) from the GLIMPSE mid-IR survey. Our estimate drops to R\nt=2.5\u00b10.4 kpc if we exclude the GLIMPSE study.", "We have already stressed the importance of M stars. Juri\u0107 et al. (2008) determine R\nt\u22482.6 kpc (20% uncertainty) for the thin disk. Gould et al. (1996) and Zheng et al. (2001) used the Hubble Space Telescope to obtain scale lengths of R\nt=3.0\u00b10.4 kpc and R\nt=2.8\u00b10.3 kpc, respectively. All of these values are consistent with the IR measurements. A short scale length finds strong support from dynamical studies of the stellar kinematics in Section 5.4. From a study of monoabundance populations (MAPs), Bovy et al. (2012c) conclude that different populations give a scale length that is smoothly changing from 2 kpc in the inner disk (older populations) to 3 kpc or maybe even longer at R=12 kpc (younger populations). However, the disk is dominated by old populations: A characteristic scale is meaningful when one considers the mass density profile of the disk. The IR photometric estimate of radial scale length is probably the most useful at the present time, although we recognize that an exponential decline in the mass distribution is a crude approximation (\nFigure 10\n). The thick disk scale length is discussed in the next section.", "For the past thirty years, some have argued for a longer disk scale length when comparing the Galaxy, with its high mass and luminosity, with external galaxies (q.v. van der Kruit & Freeman 2011). The Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey (Driver et al. 2011) includes the largest bulge/disk decomposition survey to date using the Viking\nK-band imaging survey of 4,300 disk galaxies (Lange et al. 2015). This volume-limited survey has a high level of completeness to a redshift limit of z<0.06 (M\n\u22c6>109 M\u2299). Here only a few percent of galaxy disks exceed the Milky Way's disk mass (Section 5.4.2), and their IR photometric scale lengths have a large spread (4\u00b12 kpc). The Galaxy's high luminosity and small scale length may not be so unusual.", "We highlight one spectacular result from the SDSS survey. The team was able to extract tomographic slices through the Galaxy vertical to the plane (e.g., \nFigure 12\n). \nFigure 12\n illustrates a problem with Galaxy model fits and goes some way to explaining the lack of convergence in disk parameters over three decades. Juri\u0107 et al. (2008) explicitly highlight important substructure across the Galaxy including the Virgo Overdensity and the Monoceros Ring (Newberg et al. 2002). Substructure is so prevalent that it is not possible to fit a smooth double exponential disk model in r and z to either the thick or thin disk without taking this component into account. This problem is well known for disk-halo fitting because the Sgr stream dominates so much of the halo.\n", "", "\n Figure 12\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Several studies have tried to determine the local density normalization (f\n\u03c1=\u03c1\nT\n/\u03c1\nt\n) of the thick disk compared with the thin disk with estimates ranging from 1% to 12% (e.g., Gilmore & Reid 1983, Siegel et al. 2002, Juri\u0107 et al. 2008). The large uncertainty in f\n\u03c1 is largely due to its degeneracy with the derived scale lengths for both components (Siegel et al. 2002, \u00c1rnad\u00f3ttir et al. 2009): Higher estimates of z\nt are associated with lower estimates of f\n\u03c1 and vice versa. To aid comparison with most published results, we prefer this form for f\n\u03c1 rather than normalization to the total disk mass (e.g., Piffl et al. 2014a).

It is also broadly consistent with dynamical fitting to the Solar Cylinder (e.g., f\n\u03c1\u22486%\u00b12%; Just & Jahrei\u00df 2010).", "The error is smaller when we compare the surface density of the thick and thin disks, i.e., f\n\u03a3=f\n\u03c1\nz\nT/z\nt. Here, we find f\n\u03a3=12%\u00b14%. Our analysis excludes all papers that do not fit simultaneously for the thin and thick disk. At this point, no separation is made on the basis of detailed stellar abundance information. A high thick disk local density (f\n\u03c1\u22486%) is also found when spectroscopic abundances are used to define the high [\u03b1/Fe] population (Bovy et al. 2015), but this depends on how the abundance cut is made. A low value for f\n\u03c1 is in conflict with Juri\u0107 et al. (2008), who determine the thick disk to be more massive (f\n\u03c1\u224812%) at the Solar Circle (cf. Fuhrmann 2008). Recent claims of a more massive thick disk may arise from the survey selection extending into the low [\u03b1/Fe] population (e.g., Snaith et al. 2014) or from the use of a tiny survey volume (e.g., Fuhrmann 2008).", "\nIvezi\u0107 et al. (2008) examined the vertical distribution in photometric metallicity of 2 million SDSS stars calibrated with SEGUE spectra of 60,000 F and G dwarfs (0.25 kpc.

Bond et al. 2010). Although no kinematic modeling was conducted at this stage (see Section 5.3), the SDSS team find the data are more consistent with a gradual continuum from a thin young disk to an extended older disk. A better understanding of the thick disk versus thin disk separation had to wait for spectroscopic surveys (Section 5.2), providing both improved elemental abundances and 3D space velocities (Steinmetz et al. 2006, Allende Prieto et al. 2008).", "In the past, some researchers have questioned the existence of a thick disk with discrete properties\u2014chemistry, age, kinematics\u2014beyond the obvious characteristic of physical extent (e.g., Norris & Ryan 1991). This is a fundamental question because it hinges on the formation and evolution of the major baryonic component of our Galaxy. In \nFigure 13\n, the stars of the thick disk are mostly older than those of the thin disk and have a distinct chemistry (Bensby et al. 2003, Haywood 2006, Schuster et al. 2006, Bensby 2014). It is recognized today that [\u03b1/Fe] is enhanced for the thick disk compared to the thin disk over a wide range in [Fe/H], an effect that is easily seen in sufficiently high-resolution (\n\n) spectroscopic data (Fuhrmann 1998; Gratton et al. 2000; Prochaska et al. 2000; Reddy et al. 2003, 2006; Soubiran et al. 2003) and even possibly at [Fe/H] \u2273 0 (Hayden et al. 2015, Haywood et al. 2015, Kordopatis et al. 2015). Recent studies show that the earlier counter claims likely suffered from underestimating measurement errors (e.g., Nidever et al. 2014) or they incorrectly assumed that errors between measurements are uncorrelated (e.g., Sch\u00f6nrich et al. 2014).\n", "", "\n Figure 13\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "The kinematic criteria often used to separate the disks inevitably lead to small stellar samples compared to photometric surveys.

But a clean local separation is hampered in part by extensive kinematic substructure over the local volume: The Hercules stream, for example, comprises both thick and thin disk stars (Bensby et al. 2007). But even without kinematic separation, the chemical signature of two distinct populations is evident (Adibekyan et al. 2012, Haywood et al. 2015).", "A new signature has emerged from the APOGEE survey that may help to separate the disks further. Masseron & Gilmore (2015) show that C/N is enhanced in the thick disk compared to the thin disk, presumably owing to the effects of dredge-up observed in old turnoff dwarfs and giants. The associated age (and mass) for the oldest stars is broadly consistent with \nFigure 13\n. At the present time, it is not possible to separate the thick disk from the oldest thin disk stars through age-dating, assuming such a distinction even exists. The detailed chemistry of the thick disk may provide a better discriminator than the use of phase space (x,v) and be the defining characteristic of this component. Kinematic criteria always leads to some overlap. Hawkins et al. (2015) emphasize that a more expanded chemical (\n\n) space may be called for to ensure that the thick disk can be separated from both the thin disk and the lower halo, i.e., \n\n([\u03b1/Fe], [C+N/Fe], [Al/Fe], [Mg/Mn]). A high-quality \u201cchemical tag\u201d defined in this way requires both optical and IR data at high spectroscopic resolution.", "The use of chemistry to define thick disk stars now gives a different perspective on defining the relative density and scales of the two disks. Bensby et al. (2010) found that the bimodal [\u03b1/Fe] distribution continues inside of the Solar Circle, in contrast to the outer disk where the enhanced [\u03b1/Fe] population is not detected, which led Bensby et al. (2011) to infer a shorter scale length for the thick disk. By dividing SEGUE dwarfs spectroscopically into MAPs, Bovy et al. (2012c) note the transition between a short scale length\u2014e.g., \u201chigh [\u03b1/Fe], low [Fe/H]\u201d population, with a scale height up to 1,000 pc\u2014and a longer scale length\u2014e.g., \u201clow [\u03b1/Fe], high [Fe/H]\u201d population, with a scale height below 400 pc. But the more extensive APOGEE survey of 70,000 red giants reveals that the picture is more complicated (Bovy et al. 2015, Hayden et al. 2015). Looking outward, both tracks are evident, except the high [\u03b1/Fe] sequence disappears beyond 11 kpc, whereas the low sequence is seen to at least 15 kpc.", "Toward the inner disk, the high [\u03b1/Fe] track dominates over the low [\u03b1/Fe] sequence even though an increasing fraction of stars pile up toward higher metallicities due to the thin disk abundance gradient. Over the innermost disk, the thick disk and bulge are more difficult to disentangle because they share kinematic and abundance characteristics, as observed in red giants (Alves-Brito et al. 2010, Ryde et al. 2010, Gonzalez et al. 2011b, Hill et al. 2011) and microlensed dwarf stars (Bensby et al. 2009, 2013).", "In summary, estimates for the thick disk scale length range from 1.8 to 4.9 kpc (12 papers) (e.g., Larsen & Humphreys 2003, Cheng et al. 2012), but few of these make a distinction based on chemistry. There exists now some convergence on R\nt from surveys over very different volumes and sample sizes. Bensby et al. (2011) estimate an exponential scale length of 2 kpc (\u224810% accuracy), in good agreement with the high-[\u03b1/Fe] MAPs from SEGUE (Bovy et al. 2012c), although Cheng et al. (2012) measure R\nT\u22481.8 kpc using 7,000 MSTO dwarfs from the same survey, albeit with larger errors. More recently, Bovy et al. (2015) find R\nT=2.2\u00b10.2 kpc for high-[\u03b1/Fe] MAPs using APOGEE RCGs. Overall, we conclude that R\nT=2.0\u00b10.2 kpc in which the thick disk is defined in terms of the high-[\u03b1/Fe] population.

Over a decade ago, the community recognized that progress would require kinematic information for many stars over large swaths of the sky. Since that time, there has been extensive investment in wide-field stellar kinematic surveys, some of which are still in progress: GCS (Nordstr\u00f6m et al. 2004), SEGUE (Yanny et al. 2009), Radial Velocity Experiment (RAVE; Steinmetz et al. 2006); APOGEE (Allende Prieto et al. 2008); LAMOST Experiment for Galactic Understanding and Exploration (LEGUE; Deng et al. 2012); Gaia ESO Survey (GES; Gilmore et al. 2012); and Galactic Archaeology with Hermes (GALAH; De Silva et al. 2015). These surveys look at different parts of the sky and go to different depths. Some have been rendered dynamically as 3D visualizations at the following website: \nhttps://www.rave-survey.org/project/gallery/movies\n. The GCS survey covers the full sky but is confined to the Solar Neighborhood; the SEGUE, RAVE, and APOGEE surveys penetrate deeper into the Galaxy than earlier stellar surveys. By far the largest of the new surveys, the ESA Gaia mission will obtain both spectra and astrometric information for up to \u223c150 million stars (de Bruijne et al. 2015). By the end of the decade, we can expect to have RVs and stellar parameters for millions of stars, for dwarfs out to \u223c1 kpc, and for giants out to the halo.", "Here we review the main insights to emerge from these surveys. We make a distinction between dynamical models of the Galaxy (e.g., Rix & Bovy 2013; see Section 6) and models that fit to the separate Galactic components without dynamical consistency (e.g., Catena & Ullio 2010), which we refer to as kinematic models. In a kinematic model, one specifies the stellar motions independently at each spatial location, and the gravitational field in which the stars move plays no role. In a dynamical model, the spatial density distribution of stars and their kinematics are self-consistently linked by the potential, under the assumption that the system is in steady state.", "When fitting a model, there are important considerations. First, all surveys are defined by their selection function (e.g., magnitude, velocity, coordinates), and any biases must be accommodated by the analysis. Secondly, it is important to make a stab at including a plausible star-formation history in the analysis (e.g., Sch\u00f6nrich & Binney 2009). Making more stars in the past places more old stars at higher galactic latitudes today and, therefore, at higher kinematic dispersion through the age-velocity dispersion relation (AVR) (e.g., Aumer & Binney 2009). But this adds to the complexity because (a) we are introducing new variables into an already crowded field; and (b) degeneracy exists between different parameters, e.g., the SFR and the slope of the IMF (Haywood et al. 1997).", "An increasingly popular approach to fitting is to use Bayesian optimization over a broad set of free parameters (e.g., Catena & Ullio 2010). As a worked example, in the \nSupplemental Text\n, we summarize the \n\n framework for fitting up to 20 disk parameters\u2014this code is freely available at \nhttp://sourceforge.net/p/galaxia/wiki/Home/\n. The approach is theoretically simple and allows for useful constraints on local kinematic properties. The framework incorporates a constant SFR and a 3D Galactic dust model. Uniquely, it is designed to correct for an arbitrary survey selection function and can be used to fit data to analytic functions or numerical simulations (Sharma et al. 2011).", "How Sharma et al. (2014) apply the method to the RAVE and GCS surveys by assuming the structural form of the disk f(r) and then attempting to fit for f(v|r) from the surveys is described in the \nSupplemental Text\n. They use only sky position and velocity for each star as these are the most accurate measurables. No distance information is supplied other than what is implicit in the model fitting. They fit both the Gaussian DF and the dynamically motivated Shu DF (Sharma & Bland-Hawthorn 2013); the latter performs better because it allows for asymmetric velocity distributions (relative to the Sun) due to noncircular motions experienced by most stars.", "Groups that use Bayesian optimization (Bovy & Tremaine 2012, Sharma et al. 2014) typically fit for (a) the AVR (see below); (b) the radial scale lengths (R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n, R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n) of the velocity dispersion profile; (c) the mean stellar motion \n\n with vertical height z; and (d) the solar motion (v\n\u2299). The RAVE team finds that earlier estimates of the LSR are unreliable if they neglect the vertical dependence of the mean azimuthal motion for a given population. Ultimately, even after this correction, global kinematic measures like \u03980 are expected to have systematic uncertainties because of the initial assumption on f(r) and the lack of dynamical consistency. We return to these measures in the next section.", "It is well established that the velocity dispersion of a disk stellar population \u03c3(R, \u03d5, z) increases with age (Str\u00f6mberg 1925, Wielen 1977). Disks heat because a cold thin disk occupies a small fraction of phase space, and fluctuations in the gravitational field cause stars to diffuse through phase space to regions of lower phase-space density. These effects are very difficult to model reliably through numerical simulations. For the thin disk, the AVR is sometimes approximated as a power law in cosmic time (e.g., Aumer & Binney 2009) such that", "\n", "", "where (\u03c4min, \u03c4max) are priors.

The widely used value of \u03b2=1/3 dates back to the cloud scattering model of Spitzer & Schwarzschild (1953). Though useful, this form is not universally accepted (e.g., Freeman 2001, Quillen & Garnett 2001); it makes no allowance for the thick disk, which must be treated separately. From existing data, it is very difficult to distinguish a continually rising AVR from one that steps or saturates at old ages (Aumer & Binney 2009, Casagrande et al. 2011). Some groups attempt to fit for age-metallicity trends in the thin disk, but such fits are less instructive at the present time (q.v. Freeman & Bland-Hawthorn 2002), although ultimately this information will need to be accommodated in a successful model (Sanders & Binney 2015).\n", "Comparison of measured or quoted \u03b2 indices in the age\u2013velocity dispersion relation from stellar kinematic surveys\n", "Note: The quoted errors are statistical and do not include systematic errors that are typically larger.

They used singular value decomposition to compute the moments of the velocity distribution. As expected, the thin disk stars follow near-circular, corotational orbits with a low velocity dispersion (e.g., Edvardsson et al. 1993, Reddy et al. 2003). The velocity dispersion falls as a function of distance r from the GC, consistent with theoretical expectation (Cuddeford & Amendt 1992).", "In an exponential disk, the stellar dispersion declines radially with the disk surface density \u03a3\nt\n and scale height z\nt as \n\n. Sharma et al. (2014) combined Equation 1 with an exponential factor in radius (cf. van der Kruit 1986) in order to determine the radial scale lengths (R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n, R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n) of the dispersion profile (e.g., Lewis & Freeman 1989). For an isothermal disk, R\n\u03c3 is expected to be roughly twice the disk density scale length (Bottema 1993). The RAVE study confirms that the dispersion profile declines with radius, yielding estimates of R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n \u223c 14 kpc and R\nt\n\u03c3,R\n \u223c 7.5 kpc. The thick disk value is in good agreement with a full dynamical analysis, which we return to below.

Bovy found no break in vertical dispersion between the old thin and thick disk and suggested that the thick disk is a continuation of the thin disk rather than a separate entity (cf. Sch\u00f6nrich & Binney 2009). In contrast, kinematic and dynamic studies\u2014which include a star-formation history and an AVR explicitly for the thin disk\u2014do tend to find a break in the vertical stellar dispersion (e.g., \nTable 5\n).

Delhaye studied different spectral classes and luminosity groups and arrived at v\n\u2299\u2248(9, 12, 7) km s\u22121, which is very respectable by modern standards.", "The random stellar motions of a given population is a strong function of their mean age, color, metallicity, and scale height. Care must be taken to account for the asymmetric drift of stellar populations in taking the limit to the zero-dispersion LSR orbit. Using Str\u00f6mberg's relation, Dehnen & Binney (1998) measured (U\n\u2299, V\n\u2299, W\n\u2299) = (10.0, 5.2, 7.2) km s\u22121 from the Hipparcos survey, which for two ordinates are in excellent agreement with Delhaye's early estimates. V\n\u2299 was later revised upward close to the original value (Binney 2010, Sch\u00f6nrich et al. 2010); the latter paper showed that Str\u00f6mberg's linear asymmetric drift relation is invalidated by the metallicity gradient in the disk. Our values for v\n\u2299 in the margin note are averaged over most estimates since Delhaye's original estimate. We have removed extreme outliers and ignored early values from any researcher who revised these at a later stage using a similar method. Thus, the Sun is moving inward toward the GC, upward toward the North Galactic Pole and, given z\n0, away from the plane.", "Although (U\n\u2299, W\n\u2299) have converged on Delhaye's original values within the errors (see the margin note), some uncertainty surrounds V\n\u2299 when considered across the APOGEE, RAVE, and LEGUE surveys (Bovy et al. 2012a, Sharma et al. 2014, Tian et al. 2015). One reason for this may arise from local kinematic substructure or any systematic streaming motion v\nstr in the Sun's vicinity (Dehnen 2000, Siebert et al. 2011, Williams et al. 2013, Antoja et al. 2014). A local spiral arm density wave, for example, can impose kinematic fluctuations on the order of 10 km s\u22121 (Siebert et al. 2012). In addition, because the corotation radius of the Galactic bar may be as close as \u223c2kpc inward from the Sun (Section 4.4), systematic streaming velocities may exist in the local Galactic disk due to perturbations from the bar and adjacent spiral arms. These could cause deviations of the zero-dispersion LSR orbit from the average circular velocity at R\n0, defined as the angular rotation velocity of a \u201cfictitious\u201d circular orbit in the axisymmetrically averaged gravitational potential, the so-called rotational standard of rest (RSR; see Shuter 1982, Bovy et al. 2012a). Analyzing two mostly independent samples of stars from APOGEE, RAVE, and GCS, Bovy et al. (2015) modeled the disk velocity field over \u223c3\u20134-kpc scales and found such effects, with an implied tangential LSR streaming velocity of 14\u00b13kms\u22121 relative to the RSR. However, Sharma et al. (2014) find little difference in V\n\u2299 between the local GCS survey and the RAVE data, which extends to \u223c2kpc, and Reid et al. (2014), when fitting their maser velocities with a circular orbit velocity field, find no evidence for a deviation of the globally fitted V\n\u2299 from the locally determined value. Globally determined values of U\n\u2299 (Bovy et al. 2012a, Reid et al. 2014) agree well within errors with the locally determined U\n\u2299=10\u00b11kms\u22121. Here, we adopt |v\nstr|=0+15kms\u22121 because we cannot establish clear agreement on the magnitude of the streaming motion at the present time. Future studies are anticipated to compare the impending Gaia data with models including the central bar and spiral density waves in view of understanding both the random and streaming motions in the disk.", "\nBinney et al. (2014) revisit the RAVE data but include distance estimates from Burnett et al. (2011). These were not employed by Sharma et al. (2014) because RAVE distances are susceptible to uncertainties in PMs and stellar parameters, e.g., log g (Zwitter et al. 2010, Anguiano et al. 2015). After excluding young stars, Binney finds that the velocity dispersion for a given stellar population increases as one moves vertically in z from the plane (cf. Smith et al. 2009). Furthermore, at any location in (R, z), the velocity ellipsoid's long axis (vertex deviation) points toward the GC (see \nFigure 12\n), indicating that the radial and vertical motions of stars are intimately coupled (cf. Siebert et al. 2008, Bond et al. 2010). This important result demonstrates that the stellar motions in r and z are entwined through the Galactic potential.", "Kinematic models offer greater freedom than physics really allows. This can lead to systematic errors in parameter estimation, which typically swamp the statistical errors in the optimization scheme. The way forward is to consider dynamical models such that the spatial density distribution of stars and their kinematics are linked by the gravitational potential \u03a6, under the assumption that the system is in steady state. At present, dynamical models are used to estimate a subset of parameters explored by kinematic methods (see \nTable 5\n). Although there has been good progress in recent years, with the first signs of dynamical self-consistency beginning to emerge, there is no fully consistent framework at the present time. We refer the reader to Rix & Bovy (2013, their section 6) for a useful summary of the dynamical methods on offer.", "Early methods that operate locally or in annular bins (e.g., Bienayme et al. 1987, Just & Jahrei\u00df 2010) have given way to holistic treatments over one or more dynamical components of the Galaxy (e.g., Piffl et al. 2014a, Sanders & Binney 2015). Dynamical models assume an equilibrium figure such that the phase-space density of stars f(x, v) links only to the phase-space coordinates through the constants of motion (Jean's theorem).", "\nBinney (2010, 2012) has argued that action integrals (J) are ideal for building dynamical models because they are adiabatic invariants. The most convenient action integrals are (a) Lz\n, the approximate symmetry axis of the Galaxy's angular momentum, (b) \n\n, to describe the action of a star perpendicular to the plane, and (c) \n\n, to describe the radial action of the star. The DF at any point in the Galaxy has the form \n\n. \u03a6 is derived through an iterative process starting with an initial guess \u03a6\ni\n to get to the density \u03c1\ni\n=\u222bfd3\nv integrated over the phase-space volume V. Poisson's equation is used to compute an updated \u03a6\ni+1, and the process is repeated until convergence is achieved.

(2014a) and Binney & Piffl (2015) using RAVE. In \nTable 5\n, these studies attempt to arrive at unbiased parameter estimates through fitting the data with a consistent dynamical model. Binney (2012) introduced important new ideas in model fitting, including the use of the quasi-isothermal DFs to model the disk. But his focus on a very local sample led to the disk dispersions being underestimated due to the GCS bias toward younger stars. This work has been superseded by Piffl et al. (2014a), who determined the DF from the RAVE giants. The RAVE survey comprises roughly equal numbers of dwarfs and giants, most within about 2.5 kpc of the Sun, and is thus more representative of the extended disk (Sharma et al. 2011).", "\nBovy & Rix (2013) build on Binney (2012) using 16,300 G dwarfs from the SEGUE survey. They divide stars in the [\u03b1, Fe] abundance plane into MAPs: The more metal-rich MAPs trace the inner disk, whereas the metal-poor populations trace the disk beyond the Solar Circle. Their goal is to measure the Galactic disk's mass profile by identifying a radius for each MAP where the modeling gives a tight (statistical) constraint on the local surface density. It is unclear whether (a) most MAPs can be treated as quasi-isothermal populations; and (b) the constraints at different radii from the MAPs are mutually consistent, i.e., free of systematic errors (e.g., Sanders & Binney 2015). The disk scale length is the most important unknown in disentangling the contributions from the disk and the dark halo to the mass distribution near the disk. In contrast to the photometric radial profile, without dynamical consistency, the mass-weighted radial profile cannot have been reliably measured in earlier kinematic studies.", "\nSanders & Binney (2015) revisit the SEGUE analysis and instead treat the chemical (and phase) space as a continuous distribution. They introduce the idea of an extended distribution function (EDF) \n\n in place of the DF \n\n, where Z defines the chemical domain. Though different abundance groups can have very diverse kinematics, they all necessarily reside within the same Galactic potential; the extra information in the EDF allows for a more accurate treatment of the selection function and associated errors across the survey. They determine that the thick disk vertical dispersion \u03c3t\n\nz\n is a factor of two larger than the thin disk value (\u03c3t\n\nz\n\u224825 km s\u22121), in agreement with Sharma et al.

(Although R\n\u03c3 defines the scale of the outward decline of the stellar dispersion, it is not the exponential radial scale length used in the kinematic studies because DFs are expressed in terms of integrals of motion, not radii.) Sanders & Binney state that their analysis is only preliminary because \u03a6 was kept fixed throughout. Arguably, this study comes closest to the ideal of chemodynamical self-consistency.

The outer disk warps slowly away from the Galactic Plane in both \n\n (May et al. 1993) and stars (Carney & Seitzer 1993). In addition to the warp, the outer disk flares in both stars and gas and possesses a fair degree of substructure. Moni Bidin et al. (2012) review the contradicting claims for the flaring stellar disk, but the comprehensive study by Momany et al. (2006) puts the issue beyond doubt. Carraro (2015) reviews the evidence for flaring in the outer disk in both young and old stellar populations (Cepheids, pulsars). The earlier claims of a disk edge did not consider the effect of a warping, flaring disk, so there is no strong evidence for a truncation to date in either old or young populations (L\u00f3pez-Corredoira et al. 2002, Sale et al. 2009, Carraro et al. 2010).", "A complicating factor is the presence of the near-planar Monoceros Ring at R\nGC\u2248 15\u201320 kpc (radial width \u22482 kpc) that appears to corotate at roughly the speed of the outer disk (Newberg et al. 2002, Ibata et al. 2003). The nature of this stream is unknown (cf. Xu et al. 2015): Unlike the Canis Major overdensity, which may be related to the warp, the ring appears to have its own identity after correcting for the warp (Momany et al. 2006) and may even rotate slightly faster than the disk (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2008).", "Before the optical studies, \n\n observations by Burton (1988) and Diplas & Savage (1991) identified Galactic gas out to at least R\nGC\u223c25\u201330 kpc (see also Hartmann & Burton 1997). Molecular gas clouds are seen to R\nGC\u227320 kpc, some with ongoing star formation (Kobayashi et al. 2008, Yasui et al. 2008). Further evidence for recent star formation out to these distances is the presence of young stars and open clusters (Carraro et al. 2010, Magrini et al. 2015).

This analysis brings together many of the key themes of the review. The stellar and dark matter halos share the property that they are 3D structures surrounding the disk and still grow by accreting matter. However, they do not necessarily share the same structural properties or formation histories. The gaseous halo is an important repository for a part of the Galaxy's baryonic mass and interacts with the environment through inflows and outflows.", "All three components live in the same gravitational potential, which at intermediate radii (\u223cR\n0) is shaped by the Galactic bulge, disk, and dark halo, and at large (\u223c100kpc) radii is completely dominated by the dark matter.

It was first identified as a population of old, high-velocity, metal-poor stars near the Sun, similar to the stars in globular clusters. The halo stars showed large random motions, little if any rotation, and a spheroidal to spherical spatial distribution. Following the influential paper of Eggen et al. (1962), the classical view of the halo developed as that of a smooth envelope of ancient stars from the time when the Galaxy first collapsed. Subsequently, Searle & Zinn (1978) suggested that the halo is built up from independent infalling fragments, based on their observation that halo globular clusters showed a wide range of metal abundances independent of Galactocentric distance.", "Modern data from large stellar surveys show that the stellar halo has a complex structure with multiple components and unrelaxed substructures and that it continues to accrete matter in the form of smaller galaxies, which are then tidally disrupted in the gravitational field (e.g., Ibata et al. 1997, Belokurov et al. 2006, Schlaufman et al. 2009). This confirms the predictions of hierarchical galaxy-formation models. Because of the long dynamical timescales in the halo, tidal tails, shells, and other overdensities arising from accreted dwarf galaxies remain observable over gigayears, thus constituting a fossil record of the Milky Way's accretion history. Previous reviews on this subject have been written by Helmi (2008), De Lucia (2012), Belokurov et al.

Irregular density distributions are predicted in the outer halo due to shells and tidal streams, with a large variance between different galaxies of the same dark matter halo mass. In these models, the majority of the halo is often built at early times, \n\n ago, and most of the stellar halo stars come from the disruption of one or a few massive satellites accreted early on. The outer halo is built more recently than the inner halo, and the halo properties evolve, reflecting the history of accretion (Bullock & Johnston 2005, Font et al. 2006, De Lucia & Helmi 2008, Cooper et al. 2010, Pillepich et al. 2014).", "Part of the inner halo may have formed in situ, i.e., within the main body of the Galaxy (Abadi et al. 2006).

It has been extensively studied using several tracers for which good distances can be determined, including RR Lyrae stars (typical distance accuracy \u223c7%, Vivas & Zinn 2006), blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars (\u223c5%, Belokurov et al. 2013), red giant branch (RGB) stars (\u223c16%, Xue et al. 2014), and near-main-sequence turnoff (nMSTO) stars (\u223c10% with multiple colors, Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2008). RR Lyrae and BHB stars, which trace the old metal-poor populations, are rarer than RGB and nMSTO stars, but can reach to r\u223c100kpc galactocentric radius. RGB stars trace all halo populations and currently reach to about r\u223c50kpc, whereas nMSTO stars are abundant and best for the inner halo, i.e., r\u227220kpc.", "A significant fraction of these halo tracer stars are found in large substructures (Section 6.1.2). Subtracting these leads to an estimate of a smooth halo component (e.g., Deason et al. 2011), which, however, may contain smaller, yet unresolved substructures (e.g., Sesar et al. 2013). The spatial distributions of the halo stars are typically fitted by spherical or axisymmetric density models with single power-law or double power-law (DPL) or S\u00e9rsic radial profiles, and with one or two flattening parameters for the inner and outer halo; \nTable 6\n shows recent results based on DPL models. The inner halo flattening is found to be q\nin=0.65\u00b10.05 across various studies based on data reaching down to r\u223c5kpc (see also Bell et al. 2008, Juri\u0107 et al. 2008).

For RR Lyrae and BHB stars, the outer power-law slope is in the range of \u03b1out=\u22124.5\u00b10.5, and Deason et al. (2014) found an even steeper profile beyond 50kpc. For RGB stars the slope is somewhat shallower, \u03b1out=\u22123.8\u00b10.1. The overall density profile is similar to an Einasto function (e.g., Xue et al. 2015), and qualitatively similar to density profiles predicted by halo formation models (Bullock & Johnston 2005, Cooper et al. 2010). Deason et al. (2013) use simulations to show that a distinct density break may be related to the accumulation of stars at their apocenters, following relatively massive accretion events. Lowing et al. (2014) point out that the measured density parameters depend strongly on the surveyed sightlines and halo accretion history.", "Estimating the stellar halo mass from these density distributions is nontrivial, requiring determination of the mass normalization per halo tracer star from stellar population models and calibrations, as well as extrapolating beyond the survey volume through models. Bell et al. (2008) fitted DPL models to SDSS nMSTO stars and found a best-fit stellar halo mass within r=1\u201340kpc of \u223c(3.7\u00b11.2)\u00d7108M\u2299. Deason et al.

(2011) found a lower \u03c3/totalof\u223c5\u201320% with some increase for fainter stars (larger distances); on this basis they argue for a smooth halo with superposed additional substructures. Reasons for the discrepancy between both studies could be the less accurate nMSTO distances, leading to blurring of compact substructures; the lower resolution with the rarer BHB stars; or that the BHB stars trace an older, more mixed population of stars (Deason et al. 2011). Resolving this issue requires large samples of stars with accurate distances and velocities. The problem is that even a fully accreted halo will eventually mix to be smooth above a given scale and that mixing times are shortest in the high-density inner regions.", "\nBond et al.

But it remains uncertain how much of the gas lies close to the Galactic Plane, and how much of it extends into the halo (Bland-Hawthorn & Cohen 2003). Strong evidence for extended coronae have come from the first reliable detections of hot halos around nearby massive disk galaxies (e.g., Anderson & Bregman 2011). The Galactic corona also explains the remarkable observation of gas depletion in all dwarfs within a radius of about 270 kpc, with the exception of the high-mass LMC and SMC dwarfs (Grcevich & Putman 2009), which is well understood in terms of ram-pressure stripping by a hot medium (Nichols & Bland-Hawthorn 2011, Gatto et al. 2013). Such an extended hot phase is supported by numerical simulations (Nuza et al. 2014), which focus on the properties and distribution of the multiphase gas in and around two simulated galaxies chosen as an M31-Galaxy analogue. They found the hot (T\u2273105 K) gas has a uniform temperature profile around each of the simulated galaxies and good agreement between the observed profile (Miller & Bregman 2015) and the density profile of the simulated Galaxy.", "We tabulate the most recent observations of the Galactic corona in \nTable 7\n.

It is now well established that the halo temperature as inferred from X-ray observations is fairly uniform across the sky and with little scatter around T\u22482\u00d7106K (Henley et al. 2010), although this does not demand that the halo is strictly isothermal.", "A new all-sky catalog of \n\n and \n\n emission lines (Henley & Shelton 2012) has been studied by Miller & Bregman (2013, 2015).

Miller & Bregman's model can be justified if the dark matter halo of the Galaxy is well described by a spherically symmetric isothermal sphere with a core radius rc\n\u223c0.1kpc and if the gas is quasi-isothermal and in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium with the potential.", "\nTepper-Garcia et al.

There is some confusion in the literature on the convention for a galaxy's total mass, i.e., how it should be defined and at what epoch (Shull 2014).

(2012a) determine a (virial) timing mass of 4.9\u00b11.6\u00d71012 M\u2299 for the mass within the virial radius of both galaxies (4.1\u00b11.4\u00d71012 M\u2299 for r \u2264r\n200). After considering the orbit of M33 about M31, they further reduce the total timing mass to M\nvir,timing=3.2\u00b10.6\u00d71012 M\u2299. Modern mass estimates for M31 reveal that it is comparable with the Milky Way (van der Marel et al. 2012a) such that the timing mass provides an upper limit of M\nvir\u22721.6\u00d71012 M\u2299 for the Galaxy.", "Unlike the timing mass, most mass estimators are limited to the region explored by the available tracer population, whose spatial distribution and kinematics are used to estimate the enclosed mass. Estimates of the Milky Way's mass have been obtained based on the kinematics of halo stars, the kinematics of satellite galaxies and globular clusters, the evaluation of the local escape velocity, and the modeling of satellite galaxy tidal streams. A list of direct mass determinations is compiled in \nTable 8\n. Dynamical analysis of halo star kinematics typically results in relatively low total mass, M\n200\u22721012M\u2299 (Xue et al. 2008; Deason et al. 2012; Kafle et al. 2012, 2014). The main uncertainties in such determinations are the lack of stellar tangential velocities from PMs, and/or the need to extrapolate from spatially limited samples to the scale of the virial radius. Such extrapolation is often done using simulated galaxy halos, which then fixes the dark matter density profile, or by assuming parametric forms for the density distribution and fitting for the best parameters.\n", "Total mass estimates for the Galaxy\n", "Note: M\u0394 is the mass within the radius defined with respect to the overdensity \u0394; the radius computed by the authors is indicated by R\u0394. Mrkpc is the mass within radius r in kiloparsecs as indicated. All masses are in units of 1012M\u2299; all radii are in units of kiloparsecs. Dashes,\u2013, indicate no data.", "", "Mass estimates based on satellite and globular cluster kinematics typically result in higher values, M\n200=1\u20132\u00d71012M\u2299 when the Leo I dwarf satellite galaxy is assumed to be bound to the Milky Way; however, if Leo I with its large LOS velocity is considered unbound, values more similar to M\n200\u22721012M\u2299 result (Wilkinson & Evans 1999, Li & White 2008, Watkins et al. 2010). Satellite galaxies reach to larger radii, but here the main uncertainties come from small numbers and the similar lack of PM information. Determinations of the escape velocity from RVs of stars near the Sun also lead to M\n200=1\u20132\u00d71012M\u2299 (Smith et al. 2007, Piffl et al. 2014b), again with the uncertainties of extrapolating the mass distributions to large radii. Modeling stellar positions and velocities along the orbit of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy, or matching the apocenter radii of its trailing and leading arms, leads to a range of enclosed masses of M\n100\nkpc=0.4\u20132\u00d71011M\u2299 (Gibbons et al. 2014). The Galaxy's mass can also be estimated by comparing Milky Way properties with various predictions of a cold dark matter simulation, such as the number of satellite galaxies larger than a given mass (Cautun et al. 2014). But these estimates are not reliable until the models improve. Finally, McMillan (2011) determined a value for the Milky Way mass from fitting parameterized mass models to a range of observations.", "The halo stellar kinematic studies comprise the largest and, arguably, the most reliable data sets. These estimates lead to a straight average for M\n200=1.1\u00b10.3\u00d71012M\u2299, or equivalently M\nvir=1.3\u00b10.3\u00d71012M\u2299, consistent with the upper limit from the timing mass. Interestingly, if we derive M31's mass from a simple scaling of peak rotation, i.e., (260kms\u22121/\u03980)4\nM\nvir, or a mass that is 40% higher than the Galaxy, this leads to a virial timing mass for the Galaxy that is equal to our estimate for M\nvir above. The Galaxy's virial mass cannot be much lower than 1012M\u2299 if it is to provide sufficient angular momentum to the observed baryons over its lifetime.", "Besides the total halo mass, another property of considerable interest is the shape of the dark matter halo. In dark matter only simulations, halo shapes are strongly flattened, prolate-triaxial, with mean =0.5\u00b10.1 (e.g., Dubinski & Carlberg 1991, Allgood et al. 2006). When baryons are included, the halos become more spherical and evolve toward oblate at all radii but mostly in their inner parts (e.g., Kazantzidis et al. 2004, Bailin et al. 2005, Abadi et al. 2010). In the Milky Way, constraints on the shape of the dark halo are based on the Sgr orbit, tidal streams, SDSS kinematics, flaring of the \n\n layer, and combining rotation curve and vertical acceleration measurements (see the review by Read 2014).", "The orbit of the Sgr dwarf, whose leading and trailing arms can each be followed \u223c180\u00b0 across the sky, constrain the halo shape in the range R=20\u2013100kpc (Belokurov et al. 2013). The geometry of the stream on the sky has been shown to require an oblate near-spherical halo (Ibata et al. 2001, Johnston et al. 2005), whereas LOS velocities favor a prolate shape (Helmi 2004). Thus Law & Majewski (2010) proposed a triaxial halo model for the Milky Way that is in fact nearly oblate but with its short axis in the plane of the disk and with questionable stability. For this reason, most authors continue to use spherical models for the outer halo (Ibata et al. 2013, Gibbons et al. 2014).", "On 20-kpc scales, Koposov et al. (2010) and K\u00fcpper et al. (2015) determined the flattening of the dark halo to be qz\n=0.95\u00b10.15, i.e., essentially spherical, from modeling of the tidal streams of GD-1 and Pal 5. Loebman et al. (2012) claimed evidence for a strongly oblate shape from SDSS data. Kalberla et al. (2007) found evidence from \n\n data for a ring-like distribution of dark matter around r\u223c15kpc. Near the Sun, the local shape of the dark matter halo is constrained by the ratio of the local dark matter density to the average enclosed spherical dark matter density (Garbari et al. 2012, Read 2014). Within large error bars the measurements are most consistent with a spherical or even prolate local halo shape (Garbari et al. 2012, Bovy & Rix 2013, Zhang et al. 2013), i.e., no dark disk (Read 2014). On the whole, constraints on the dark matter halo shape in the Milky Way are still weak, and no consistent picture has yet emerged.", "Compared to the extended distribution of dark matter, the baryonic mass component in the Milky Way is centrally concentrated and dominates the mass in the central few kiloparsecs. In this section, we review the total circular velocity at R\n0 and the rotation curve of the Milky Way, and then use illustrative dynamical models to estimate the contribution of stars and gas to the rotation curve, as well as the baryon fraction as a function of radius.", "We recall from Section 3.4 the total angular velocity of the Sun, \u03a9\ng,\u2299=30.24\u00b10.12kms\u22121kpc\u22121, derived from the VLBI PM of Sgr A\\* in the Galactic Plane and the assumption that Sgr A\\* is at rest at the GC. For R\n0=8.2\u00b10.1kpc (Section 3.2), the corresponding total solar tangential velocity is V\n\ng,\u2299=248\u00b13kms\u22121. These values agree within errors with a number of independent recent measurements: Modeling trigonometric parallaxes and \n\ns of masers in HMSFR in the Galactic disk, Reid et al. (2014) derive \u03a9\ng,\u2299=30.57\u00b10.43kms\u22121kpc\u22121, giving V\n\ng,\u2299=251\u00b15kms\u22121. The analysis of the nearby velocity field from SEGUE by Sch\u00f6nrich (2012), at fixed R\n0=8.2kpc, results in V\n\ng,\u2299=248\u00b16kms\u22121. Bovy et al. (2012a) determine V\n\ng,\u2299=242+10\n\u22123kms\u22121 from APOGEE data, whereas Sharma et al. (2014) obtain V\n\ng,\u2299=244kms\u22121 from fitting RAVE data. Here, we interpolated to R\n0=8.2kpc and estimate a systematic error of \u223c5kms\u22121 from their results. K\u00fcpper et al. (2015) find V\n\ng,\u2299=254\u00b116kms\u22121 from modeling the tidal stream of Pal 5. In what follows, we use V\n\ng,\u2299=248\u00b13kms\u22121 from the PM of Sgr A\\*.", "In an axisymmetric Galaxy, the circular velocity \u03980 is simply related to V\n\ng,\u2299=(\u03980+V\n\u2299). Here V\n\u2299 is the Sun's peculiar velocity along the direction of rotation with respect to the LSR, with the LSR defined as the streaming velocity of local stellar populations relative to the Sun in the limit of vanishing velocity dispersion (e.g., Sch\u00f6nrich et al. 2010). In Section 5.3.3, we estimated V\n\u2299=10.5\u00b11.5kms\u22121. In our barred Galaxy, the LSR could itself have an additional streaming velocity V\nLSR relative to the circular velocity in the axisymmetrically averaged gravitational potential (the RSR, see Section 5.3.3), due to perturbations from the bar and spiral arms. As discussed in Section 5.3.3, our estimate for the total LSR streaming velocity is |v\nstr|=0+15kms\u22121, which could mostly be directed in the forward direction of rotation. If we take V\nLSR=\u00b1|v\nstr|=0\u00b115kms\u22121, V\n\ng,\u2299 and \u03980 are now related by V\n\ng,\u2299=(\u03980+V\nLSR+V\n\u2299); this results in \u03980=238\u00b115kms\u22121 and \u03a90=\u03980/R\n0=29.0\u00b11.8kms\u22121kpc\u22121.", "Traditionally, Oort's constants A and B were defined for the local disk as a means to estimate the circular velocity \u03980(R\n0) and its gradient from RV and PM data for nearby stellar populations, viz., A\u2212B=\u03980/R\n0; \n\n.

For the rotation gradient \u2212(A + B), different authors find positive, zero, and negative values. Catena & Ullio (2010) argue for A+B=0.18\u00b10.47kms\u22121kpc\u22121 from an SDSS study of M stars (Fuchs et al. 2009).", "\n\nFigure 16\n assembles rotation velocity measurements from various sources as explained in the caption.

PM data from Gaia will clarify this. The rotation velocities determined by Sofue et al. (2009, see also original references therein) from terminal velocities and a circular rotation model are unreliable in the region dominated by the Galactic bar (e.g., Englmaier & Gerhard 1999, Fux 1999), as is clearly visible in the central \u223c3kpc. Points inside R=5kpc (the half-length of the Galactic bar, Section 4.3) are therefore plotted in light shade.\n", "", "\n Figure 16\u2002\n Click to view", "", "", "Is the disk maximal? As shown with the illustrative models in \nFigure 16\n, the answer to this question largely depends on the disk (mass) scale length. These models include a bulge with dynamical mass fitted to the BRAVA kinematic data and stellar mass corresponding to a Kroupa IMF with \u00b110% margins (Portail et al. 2015b). The disk has local stellar surface density of \n\n (Bovy & Rix 2013) and scale lengths R\nd=2.15kpc (Bissantz & Gerhard 2002, Bovy & Rix 2013), 2.6kpc (Robin et al. 2003, Juri\u0107 et al. 2008), and 3.0kpc (Kent et al. 1991, Gould et al. 1996) and includes a gas disk with surface density of \n\n and twice the stellar scale length. A short scale length R\nd has important implications: The Galaxy's disk (summed over all stellar and gaseous components) is then maximal (Sackett 1997) in the sense that the disk and bulge dominate the rotation curve, i.e., contribute 85% of the rotational velocity and \u223c70% of the rotational support at 2.2R\nd. We included the bulge in the definition here because it mostly originates from the disk (Section 4.2). For the three scale lengths shown, the baryonic component provides a median fraction fv\n= (86%, 73%, 65%) of the circular velocity and (74%, 53%, 42%) of the radial force at 2.2R\nd. Thus the Milky Way's disk is maximal only for the shortest scale length (see also Sackett 1997, Gerhard 1999, Bovy & Rix 2013, Piffl et al. 2014a), but even for the longer R\nd its contribution to the rotational velocity is at the upper limit of that inferred for typical spiral galaxies by Martinsson et al. (2013, fv\n=0.4\u20130.7; but see Aniyan et al. 2016).", "The dynamical models shown in \nFigure 16\n have median total stellar masses of (5.7, 5.0, 4.7)\u00d71010M\u2299. Of this, the stellar mass of the bulge and the disk embedded in the bulge region is \u223c1.5\u00d71010M\u2299. The remaining mass is consistent with the total disk mass given in Section 5, if we consider the mass of the long bar (\u223c1\u00d71010M\u2299) as part of the disk mass. Thus our estimate of the total stellar mass in the Milky Way is M\n\u22c6=5\u00b11\u00d71010M\u2299. Adding the mass in cold gas and the 2.9\u00d71010M\u2299 (this model has higher mass than those in Section 6.2) in hot gas resulting from Tepper-Garcia et al. (2015) for the NFW halo shown in \nFigure 16\n (M\nvir=1.3\u00d71012M\u2299, Section 6.3; c=16), the total baryonic mass fraction of the Galaxy becomes again 0.07\u00b10.01.

Our first task is to describe its current state in some detail; this allows us to connect to similar galaxies nearby and to studies of galaxies at high redshift. Characterizing the Galaxy's dominant components and measuring their main parameters is an important step in this process.", "The past few years have seen significant progress in several areas, driven by the impressive data from past and ongoing surveys such as SDSS, VVV, APOGEE, and RAVE. We now have a quantitative description of the b/p structure of the Galactic bulge and, to a lesser extent, of its continuation into the Galactic Plane, the long bar. We know that the thin and thick disks contain distinct sequences in abundance ratios and age. The velocity field in the disk near the Sun has been charted, and dynamical models have been developed to link these data self-consistently to the gravitational potential. In the Galactic halo, multiple satellites and substructures have been discovered, and density and velocity measurements have been made to beyond >50kpc. However, we still lack good understanding of, e.g., the radial scale length of the large-scale Galactic disk, the transition region between the Galactic bar and the surrounding disk, the properties of the nuclear disk, the mass of the stellar halo, and the outer rotation curve of the Milky Way. Constructing a complete structural model for the Milky Way is one of the main challenges for the coming years.", "Half of all stars in the Universe formed before a redshift of unity. Detailed chemistry for millions of stars will provide important new information on the early formation of the different components. Until recently, most of our understanding of stars has come from the Solar Neighborhood, but high-resolution stellar surveys have now begun to reach more representative regions of the Galaxy. We still do not have a complete chemical inventory for any component over its full physical extent. In principle, such data for enough stars will enable chemical tagging of dynamically distinct subsystems. If even a few disrupted stellar systems with different ages can be recovered, we can learn about the role of secular evolution and stellar migration over cosmic time from their dispersal across the disk (Bland-Hawthorn et al. 2010). But accurate elemental abundances are hampered by the difficulty of measuring good stellar parameters (e.g., log g, effective temperature). The differential abundance technique shows great promise, but this works best if the stars have a similar spectral type, thereby limiting the sample size. But we are encouraged by the revolution that is now under way to improve the state of the art in achieving consistent stellar abundances (Jofr\u00e9 et al. 2014, Ness et al. 2015).", "We are looking forward to a golden age for Galactic research exemplified by ESA Gaia, the astrometric space mission that was successfully deployed at the end of 2013.

In a single exposure, LSST will detect metal-poor MSTO stars to \u223c140 kpc and HB and RR Lyrae stars to \u223c500 kpc, going several times further in the final co-added data. LSST will also provide PM measurements and parallaxes for stars below r\u223c20, where Gaia lacks sensitivity (Ivezi\u0107 et al. 2012).
