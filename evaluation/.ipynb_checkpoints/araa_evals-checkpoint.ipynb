       "  'Stars are the “atoms” of the universe, and the problem of how stars form is at the nexus of much of contemporary astrophysics. By transforming gas into stars, star formation determines the structure and evolution of galaxies. By tapping the nuclear energy in the gas left over from the Big Bang, it determines the luminosity of galaxies and, quite possibly, leads to the reionization of the Universe. Most of the elements—including those that make up the world around us—are formed in stars. Finally, the process of star formation is inextricably tied up with the formation and early evolution of planetary systems.',\n",
       "  'The problem of star formation can be divided into two broad categories: microphysics and macrophysics. The microphysics of star formation deals with how individual stars (or binaries) form. Do stars of all masses acquire most of their mass via gravitational collapse of a single dense core? How are the properties of a star or binary determined by the properties of the medium from which it forms? How does the gas that goes into a protostar lose its magnetic flux and angular momentum? How do massive stars form in the face of intense radiation pressure? What are the properties of the protostellar disks, jets, and outflows associated with young stellar objects (YSOs), and what governs their dynamical evolution?',\n",
       "  'The macrophysics of star formation deals with the formation of systems of stars, ranging from clusters to galaxies. How are giant molecular clouds (GMCs), the loci of most star formation, themselves formed out of diffuse interstellar gas? What processes determine the distribution of physical conditions within star-forming regions, and why does star formation occur in only a small fraction of the available gas? How is the rate at which stars form determined by the properties of the natal GMC or, on a larger scale, of the interstellar medium (ISM) in a galaxy? What determines the mass distribution of forming stars: Is it the initial mass function (IMF)? Most stars form in clusters (Lada & Lada 2003); how do stars form in such a dense environment and in the presence of enormous radiative and mechanical feedback from other YSOs?',\n",
       "  'Many of these questions, particularly those related to the microphysics of star formation, were discussed in the classic review by Shu, Adams & Lizano (1987). Much has changed since then. Observers have made enormous strides in characterizing star formation on all scales and in determining the properties of the medium from which stars form. Aided by powerful computers, theorists have been able to numerically model the complex physical and chemical processes associated with star formation in three dimensions. Perhaps most important, a new paradigm has emerged, in which large-scale, supersonic turbulence governs the macrophysics of star formation.',\n",

Recent relevant reviews include those on the physics of star formation (Larson 2003), and on the role of supersonic turbulence in star formation (Mac Low & Klessen 2004, Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). The review by Zinnecker & Yorke (2007, in this volume) provides a different perspective on high-mass star formation, while that by Bergin & Tafalla (2007, in this volume) gives a more detailed description of dense cores just prior to star formation. Because the topic is vast, we must necessarily exclude a number of relevant topics from this review: primordial star formation (see Bromm & Larson 2004), planet formation, astrochemistry, the detailed physics of disks and outflows, radiative transfer, and the properties of YSOs.',\n",

Section 4 reviews the microphysics of star formation, covering low-mass star formation (4.1), disks and winds (4.2), and high-mass star formation (4.3). We conclude in Section 5 with an overview of the star-formation process.',\n",

Turbulence is in fact important in essentially all branches of astrophysics that involve gas dynamics, and many communities have contributed to the recent progress in understanding and characterizing turbulence in varying regimes. [Chandrasekhar (1949) presaged this development, in choosing the then-new theory of turbulence as the topic of his Henry Norris Russell prize lecture.] Here, we concentrate on the parameter regimes of turbulence applicable within the cold interstellar medium and the physical properties of these flows that appear particularly influential for controlling star formation.',\n",

       "  'Turbulence is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as a state of “violent commotion, agitation, or disturbance,” with a turbulent fluid further defined as one “in which the velocity at any point fluctuates irregularly.” Although turbulence is, by definition, an irregular state of motion, a central concept is that order nevertheless persists as scale-dependent spatial correlations among the flow variables. These correlations can be measured in many ways; common mathematical descriptions include autocorrelation functions, structure functions, and power spectra.',\n",
       "  'One of the most fundamental quantities, which is also one of the most intuitive to understand, is the root mean square (RMS) velocity difference between two points separated by a distance r. With the velocity structure function of order p defined as \\n\\n, this quantity is given as \\n\\n. The autocorrelation function of the velocity is related to the structure function: \\n\\n; note that the autocorrelation with zero lag is A(0) = 〈|v|2〉, as S\\n2 (0) = 0. The power spectrum of velocity, P(k) ≡ |v(k)|2, is the Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function. For zero mean velocity, the velocity dispersion averaged over a volume ℓ3, σ\\nv\\n (ℓ)2, is equal to the power spectrum integrated with k\\nmin = 2π/ℓ. If turbulence is isotropic and the system in which it is observed is spatially symmetric with each dimension ≈ℓ, then the 1D velocity dispersion along a given line of sight (a direct observable) will be related to the 3D velocity dispersion by \\n\\n. Analogous structure functions, correlation functions, and power spectra can also be defined for the magnetic field, as well as other fluid variables, including the density (see Section 2.1.4). Delta-variance techniques provide similar information, and are particularly useful for reducing edge effects when making comparisons with observational data (Bensch, Stutzki & Ossenkopf 2001).',\n",

The Fourier amplitude |v(k)| is then (on average) only a function of ℓ = 2π/k, and can be denoted by v(ℓ); to emphasize that these velocities are perturbations about a background state, the amplitude of a given Fourier component is often written as δ v(k) or δ v(ℓ). When there is a large dynamic range between the scales associated with relevant physical parameters (see Section 2.1.3), correlations often take on power-law forms.

       "  'The turbulent scaling relations reflect the basic physics governing the flow. The classical theory of Kolmogorov (1941) applies to incompressible flow, i.e., when the velocities are negligible compared to the thermal speed σth = (P\\nth/ρ)1/2 (where ρ is the density and P\\nth is the thermal pressure); σth is equal to the sound speed cs\\n = (γ Pth\\n/ρ)1/2 in an isothermal (γ = 1) gas. In incompressible flows, energy is dissipated and turbulent motions are damped only for scales smaller than the Reynolds scale ℓν at which the viscous terms in the hydrodynamic equations, ∼ν v(ℓ)/ℓ2, exceed the nonlinear coupling terms between scales, ∼v(ℓ)2/ℓ; here ν is the kinematic viscosity. At scales large compared to ℓν, and small compared to the system as a whole, the rate of specific energy transfer \\n\\n between scales is assumed to be conserved, and equal to the dissipation rate at the Reynolds scale.

       "  'Because velocities \\n\\n in molecular clouds are in general not small compared to cs\\n, at least for sufficently large ℓ, one cannot expect the Kolmogorov theory to apply. In particular, some portion of the energy at a given scale must be directly dissipated via shocks, rather than cascading conservatively through intermediate scales until ℓν is reached. In the limit of zero pressure, the system would consist of a network of (overlapping) shocks; this state is often referred to as Burgers turbulence (Frisch & Bec 2001). Because the power spectrum corresponding to a velocity discontinuity in one dimension has P(k) ∝ k\\n−2, an isotropic system of shocks in three dimensions would also yield power-law scalings for the velocity correlations, with n = 4 and q = 1/2. Note that correlations can take on a power-law form even if there is not a conservative inertial cascade; a large range of spatial scales with consistent physics is still required.',\n",
       "  'Turbulence in a magnetized system must differ from the unmagnetized case because of the additional wave families and nonlinear couplings involved, as well as the additional diffusive processes—including resistive and ion-neutral drift terms (see Section 2.1.3). When the magnetic field B is strong, in the sense that the Alfvén speed \\n\\n satisfies \\n\\n, a directionality is introduced such that the correlations of the flow variables may depend differently on r\\n||, r\\n⊥, k\\n||, and k\\n⊥, the displacement and wavevector components parallel and perpendicular to \\n\\n.',\n",
       "  'For incompressible magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) turbulence, Goldreich & Sridhar (1995) introduced the idea of a critically balanced anisotropic cascade, in which the nonlinear mixing time perpendicular to the magnetic field and the propagation time along the magnetic field remain comparable for wavepackets at all scales, so that \\n\\n. Interactions between oppositely directed Alfvén wavepackets traveling along magnetic fields cannot change their parallel wavenumbers \\n\\n, so that the energy transfers produced by these collisions involve primarily k\\n⊥; i.e., the cascade is through spatial scales ℓ⊥ = 2π/k\\n⊥, with v(ℓ⊥)3/ℓ⊥ ∼ constant. Combining critical balance with a perpendicular cascade yields anisotropic power spectra (larger in the k\\n⊥ direction); at a given level of power, the theory predicts k\\n|| ∝ k\\n⊥\\n2/3. Magnetic fields and velocities are predicted to have the same power spectra.',\n",
       "  'Unfortunately, for the case of strong compressibility (cs\\n ^Lt; v) and moderate or strong magnetic fields (cs\\n ≪ v\\nA ≲ v), which generally applies within molecular clouds, there is as yet no simple conceptual theory to characterize the energy transfer between scales and to describe the spatial correlations in the velocity and magnetic fields. On global scales, the flow may be dominated by large-scale (magnetized) shocks that directly transfer energy from macroscopic to microscopic degrees of freedom. Even if velocity differences are not sufficient to induce (magnetized) shocks, for trans-sonic motions compressibility implies strong coupling among all the MHD wave families. However, within a sufficiently small subvolume of a cloud (and away from shock interfaces), velocity differences may be sufficiently subsonic that the incompressible MHD limit and the Alfvénic cascade approximately holds locally.',\n",
       "  'Even without direct energy transfer from large to small scales in shocks, a key property of turbulence not captured in classical models is intermittency effects—the strong (space-time) localization of dissipation in vortex sheets or filaments, which can occur even with a conservative energy cascade. (Shocks in compressible flows represent a different class of intermittent structures.) Signatures of intermittency are particularly evident in departures of high-order structure function exponents from the value p/3, and in non-Gaussian tails of velocity-increment probability distribution functions (PDFs) (e.g., Lis et al. 1996, Sreenivasan & Antonia 1997). Proposed methods to account for intermittency in predicting correlation functions for incompressible, unmagnetized turbulence have been discussed by She & Leveque (1994) and Dubrulle (1994). Boldyrev (2002) proposed an adaptation of this framework for the compressible MHD case, but omitted direct dissipation of large-scale modes in shocks. Research on formal turbulence theory is quite active (see Elmegreen & Scalo 2004 for a review of the recent theoretical literature relevant to the ISM), although a comprehensive framework remains elusive.',\n",
       "  'Large-scale numerical simulations afford a complementary theoretical approach to model turbulence and to explore the spatial correlations within flows. Numerical experiments can be used to test formal theoretical proposals, and to provide controlled, quantitative means to interpret observations—within the context of known physics—when formal theories are either nonexistant or limited in detail. In drawing on the results of numerical experiments, it is important to ensure that the computational techniques employed adequately capture the relevant dynamical processes. For systems in which there are steep gradients of velocities and densities, grid-based methods are more accurate in following details of the evolving flow (such as development of instabilities) than smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods, which have been shown to have difficulty capturing shocks and other discontinuities (Agertz et al. 2007, submitted).',\n",
       "  'Spatial correlations within turbulent flows have been evaluated using numerical simulations in a variety of regimes. Overall, results are consistent with theoretical predictions in that power-law scalings in the velocity and magnetic field power spectra (or structure functions) are clear when there is sufficient numerical resolution to separate driving and dissipative scales. At resolutions of 5123 and above, results with a variety of numerical methods show angle-averaged power-law slopes n = 7/2-11/3 (i.e., 3.5-3.67) for incompressible (i.e., v/cs\\n ≪ 1) MHD flows (Müller, Biskamp & Grappin 2003; Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004; Müller & Grappin 2005) and n = 3.5 − 4.0 for strongly compressible (v/cs\\n ≳ 5) flows both with (Vestuto et al. 2003, Padoan et al. 2007) and without (Kritsuk, Norman & Padoan 2006) magnetic fields. Consistent with expectations, spectra are steeper for compressive velocity components than for magnetic fields (and also sheared velocity components if the magnetic field is moderate or strong), and steeper for more supersonic and/or more weakly magnetized models (see also Boldyrev, Nordlund & Padoan 2002; Padoan et al. 2004).',\n",
       "  'When strong mean magnetic fields are present, there is clear anisotropy in the power spectrum, generally consistent with the scaling prediction of Goldreich & Sridhar (1995), for both incompressible and compressible MHD turbulence (Cho & Vishniac 2000; Maron & Goldreich 2001; Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac 2002a; Cho & Lazarian 2003; Vestuto, Ostriker & Stone 2003).',\n",
       "  'In order to identify the sources of turbulence in astronomical systems, it is also important to determine the behavior of velocity and magnetic field correlations on spatial scales larger than the driving scale. Numerical simulations, both for incompressible (Maron & Goldreich 2001; Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004) and compressible MHD turbulence (Vestuto, Ostriker & Stone 2003), show that the power spectra below the driving wavenumber scale are nearly flat, n ≈ 0; that is, inverse cascade effects are limited. For spatially localized forcing (rather than forcing localized in k-space), Nakamura & Li (2007) also found a break in the power spectrum, at wavelength comparable to the momentum injection scale. Thus, the forcing scale for internally driven turbulence in a system can be inferred observationally from the peak or knee of the velocity correlation function. If v(ℓ) continues to rise up to ℓ ∼ L, the overall scale of a system, this implies that turbulence is either (a) externally driven, (b) imposed in the initial conditions when the system is formed, or (c) driven internally to reach large scales. Note that for systems forced at multiple scales, or both internally and externally, breaks may be evident in the velocity correlation function (or power spectrum).',\n",
       "  'Recent numerical simulations under quite disparate physical regimes have reached remarkably similar conclusions for the dissipation rates of turbulence. On dimensional grounds, the specific energy dissipation rate should equal ε U\\n3/ℓ0, where E = U\\n2/2 is the total specific kinetic energy, ℓ0 is the spatial wavelength of the main energy-containing scale (comparable to the driving scale for forced turbulence; ℓ0 ≤ L), and ε is a dimensionless coefficient. For incompressible turbulence, the largest-scale (40963 zones) incompressible, unmagnetized, driven-turbulence simulations to date (Kaneda et al. 2003) yield a dimensionless dissipation coefficent ε = 0.6. For driven incompressible MHD turbulence (at 10243 resolution), the measured dimensionless dissipation rate \\n\\n also works out to be ε = 0.6 (Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004). Quite comparable results also hold for strongly compressible (U/cs\\n = 5) turbulence at a range of magnetizations v\\nA/cs\\n = 0-10; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie (1998) found that ε = 0.6 − 0.7 for simulations at resolution up to 5123 zones. For decaying compressible MHD turbulence, damping timescales are also comparable to the flow crossing time ℓ0/v(ℓ0) on the energy-containing scale (Mac Low et al. 1998; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie 1998; Mac Low 1999; Padoan & Nordlund 1999). Thus, although very different physical processes are involved in turbulence dissipation under different circumstances, the overall damping rates summed over all available channels (including shock, reconnection, and shear structures) are nevertheless quite comparable. Defining the turbulent dissipation timescale as \\n\\n and the flow crossing time over the main energy-containing scale as tf\\n = ℓ0/U, t\\ndiss = tf\\n/(2ε). Because velocities in GMCs increase up to the largest scale, ℓ0 → d, the cloud diameter. Assuming that on average \\n\\n, the turbulent dissipation time based on numerical results is therefore given by',\n",
       "  'This result is in fact consistent with the assumption of Mestel & Spitzer (1956) that turbulence in GMCs would decay within a crossing time.',\n",
       "  'The above results apply to homogenous, isotropic turbulence, but under certain circumstances if special symmetries apply, turbulent damping rates may be lower. One such case is for incompressible turbulence consisting of Alfvén waves all propagating in the same direction along the magnetic field. Note that for the incompressibility condition ∇ ⋅ v = 0 to apply, turbulent amplitudes must be quite low (v ≪ cs\\n). Because Alfvén waves are exact solutions of the incompressible MHD equations, no nonlinear interactions, and hence no turbulent cascade, can develop if only waves with a single propagation direction are present in this case (see, e.g., Chandran 2004 for a mathematical and physical discussion). A less extreme situation is to have an imbalance in the flux of Alfvén waves propagating upward and downward along a given magnetic field direction. Maron & Goldreich (2001) show that in decaying incompressible MHD turbulence, the power in both upward- and downward-propagating components decreases together until the lesser component is depleted. Cho, Lazarian & Vishniac (2002a) quantify decay times of imbalanced incompressible turbulence, finding for example that if the initial imbalance is ≈50% or ≈70%, then the time to decay to half the initial energy is increased by a factor 1.5 or 2.3, respectively, compared to the case of no imbalance.',\n",
       "  'For even moderate-amplitude subsonic velocities, however, Alfvén waves couple to other wave families, and the purely Alfvénic cascade is lost. For strongly supersonic motions, as are present in GMCs, the mode coupling is quite strong. As a consequence, even a single circularly polarized Alfvén wave cannot propagate without losses; a parametric instability known as the decay instability (Sagdeev & Galeev 1969) develops in which three daughter waves (a forward-propagating compressive wave and two oppositely propagating Alfvén waves when β ≪ 1) grow at the expense of the mother wave. The initial growth rate of the instability is γ = (0.1-0.3)kvA when v(k)/cs\\n = 1 − 3 and β ≡ 2cs\\n\\n2/v\\nA\\n2 = 0.2, and larger for greater amplitudes and smaller β (Goldstein 1978). The ultimate result is decay into fully developed turbulence (Ghosh & Goldstein 1994; Del Zanna, Velli & Londrillo 2001). Thus, for conditions that apply within GMCs, even if there were a localized source of purely Alfvénic waves (i.e., initially 100% imbalanced), the power would rapidly be converted to balanced, broad-spectrum turbulence with a short decay time. The conclusion that turbulent damping times within GMCs are expected to be comparable to flow crossing times has important implications for understanding evolution in star-forming regions; these are discussed in Sections 3.1 and 3.2.2.',\n",

For isothermal gas and supersonic turbulence (either forced or decaying), a number of 3D numerical simulations both with (Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Ostriker 2003; Li et al. 2004) and without (Nordlund & Padoan 1999, Klessen 2000) magnetic fields have shown that the density PDF approaches a log-normal distribution when self-gravity is unimportant.

From the Central Limit Theorem, \\n\\n is the sum of independent random variables, and should therefore approach a Gaussian distribution. When the equation of state departs from a simple isothermal form, the density PDF still follows a log-normal distribution over a range of densities, but aquires power-law tails either at high or low density depending on whether the equation of state is softer or stiffer than isothermal (Passot & Vázquez-Semadeni 1998, Scalo et al. 1998; see also Wada 2001).',\n",

The low value of n\\nρ′ at large Mach number implies the density structure becomes dominated by curved sheets and filaments. Curved sheets represent stagnation regions (of the compressive velocity field) where shocked gas from colliding flows settles, and filaments mark the intersections of these curved sheets.',\n",

       "  'Many subsequent studies have been made of observed scaling behavior of velocities, both for subsystems of a given star-forming region, and for systems that are spatially disjointed. A number of methods have been developed for these investigations, including autocorrelation analysis (Miesch & Bally 1994) and delta-variance analysis (Ossenkopf et al. 2006) applied to line centroids, the spectral correlation function (Rosolowsky et al. 1999), velocity channel analysis (Lazarian & Pogosyan 2004, Padoan et al. 2006), and principal component analysis (PCA) (Brunt & Heyer 2002). Overall, analyses agree in finding power-law linewidth-size relations, with similar coefficients and power-law exponents close to q = 0.5. The lack of features in velocity correlations at intermediate scales, and more generally the secular increase in velocity dispersion up to sizes comparable to the whole of a GMC, indicates that turbulence is driven on large scales within or external to GMCs (e.g., Ossenkopf & Mac Low 2002, Brunt 2003).',\n",

       "  'For evaluating the density distribution, the most unbiased measurements use dust extinction maps (see Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007 and references therein). A promising new technique for observing the density distribution uses scattered IR light (Foster & Goodman 2006), which can probe the structure of molecular clouds for visual extinctions of 1–20 mag at very high spatial resolution (Padoan, Juvela & Pelkonen 2006). Consistent with the prediction of numerical simulations (Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Vázquez-Semadeni & García 2001), distributions of extinction follow log-normal functional forms to an excellent approximation; distributions of integrated intensity from molecular lines, however, are not log-normal (Ridge et al. 2006), presumably owing to a combination of chemistry and/or optical depth effects. Column density distributions, of course, cannot be directly inverted to obtain volume density distributions. Because the Fourier transform of the column density, N(kx, ky\\n), is equal to δ ρ (kx, ky; kz\\n = 0) (up to an overall normalization; here z is the line-of-sight direction) if statistical isotropy holds, then at least the shape of the density power spectrum can be obtained from a well-sampled map of column density.

In principle, features in the density power spectrum should be evident both at the sonic scale, ℓ\\ns\\n, and the Jeans scale (these scales are comparable in star-forming regions—Padoan 1995). A first step toward identifying features in the density power spectrum, using velocity-integrated CO intensity, was taken by Blitz & Williams (1997). It will be very interesting to investigate column density power spectra based on high-resolution extinction maps in both self-gravitating GMCs and unbound molecular clouds to evaluate the slopes and search for evidence of these breaks.',\n",

In addition, the typical range of density contrasts obtained for 3D supersonic tubulence (see Section 2.1.4) is consistent with the compressions required to explain the low effective volume filling factors of gas deduced from CO observations of GMCs (Ostriker, Gammie & Stone 1999).

For more complex field geometries, the magnetic flux does not determine the mass that can be supported by magnetic stresses; for example, if the field is poloidal, with half the field pointing one way and half the other, so that the total flux is zero, the mass that could be supported would initially be M\\nΦ, but it would go to zero as the field reconnects. For a random field, arguments based on McKee & Holliman (1999) suggest that the mass that can be supported by magnetic fields is comparable to that in Equation 16, but with Φ replaced by π R\\n2 〈B\\n2〉1/2. Of course, when turbulent magnetic fields are present so are turbulent velocities, which lend their own support to the cloud (see below).',\n",

This approach is based on the microturbulent approximation, in which the turbulent pressure ρ σnt\\n2 is included in the total pressure (Chandrasekhar 1951a,b); this is equivalent to assuming that the random dynamical motions are isotropic. For a given cloud at a given time, this is reasonable for small-scale motions, but the approximation becomes worse as the scale of the motion becomes comparable to the scale on which the pressure is being evaluated. However, just as in the case of the virial theorem, the microturbulent approximation becomes better—for objects that live more than a dynamical time—if a time average is taken. Polytropes are spherical, so polytropic models apply only to objects with well-defined centers; for such objects, an angular average is also necessary, which improves the accuracy of the microturbulent approximation. Star-forming clumps and cores often appear centrally concentrated and are therefore suitable for modeling with a polytrope, whereas many GMCs do not appear to have well-defined centers and are not very suitable for polytropic models.',\n",
       "  'For a polytrope, the velocity dispersion obeys σ2 = P/ρ ∝ ργ\\np − 1. If the mean density decreases with increasing scale (as it does for an object in hydrostatic equilibrium), it follows that the velocity dispersion increases with scale for γp < 1, which is consistent with observations of molecular clouds (Maloney 1988). [Because n = 1/(γp − 1) is negative in this case, such polytropes are often referred to as negative-index polytropes.] The stability of a polytrope depends on both γp and on its adiabatic index γ, which describes the change in the pressure associated with a given perturbation in density, δ ln P = γ δ ln ρ. The value γ = 4/3 is critical for spherical clouds: clouds with γ > 4/3 are gravitationally stable for arbitrarily large masses, whereas those with γ < 4/3 are unstable for sufficiently large masses, or, at fixed mass, for sufficiently high ambient pressures. Correspondingly, the gravitational mass MG\\n is independent of density for γ = 4/3. Polytropes with γp < 6/5 must be confined by an ambient pressure (Chandrasekhar 1939), and their properties are determined by the pressure of the ambient medium. McKee & Holliman (1999) show that polytropes with 0 < γp ≤ 1 have masses ≤1.182 MG\\n (ρ0); the mean density and pressure of these polytropes are <3.8 times the surface values.',\n",
       "  'As discussed in Section 2.1.5, turbulent regions exhibit a line width–size relation in which the velocity dispersion averaged over a volume increases systematically with size scale, σnt ∝ rq\\n. Observations often show q ≃ 1/2, the value expected for Burgers turbulence (see Section 2.1.1). In general, this linewidth-size relation reflects the statistical increase in velocity differences with separation between two points, rather than the absolute increase in the local turbulent velocity amplitude with distance from a common center. If the medium is gravitationally stratified, however, the central point has a physical significance, and it is not currently known whether in this situation q varies significantly (locally or globally) from its value in a nonstratified medium. Observations of individual low-mass cores indicate increasing linewidths away from the centers, with q ≃ 1/2 on large scales (Goodman et al. 1998); similar observations for star-forming clumps or high-mass cores, which are supersonically turbulent, are not yet available. In polytropic models with σnt ∝ ρ(γp−1)/2 ∝ rq\\n, the density follows a power-law in radius, ρ ∝ r\\n−kρ\\n, with k\\nρ = 2q/(1 − γp). In hydrostatic equilibrium, k\\nρ = 2/(2 − γp) must hold, so that q = (1 − γp)/(2 − γp); the value q = 1/2 thus corresponds to γp → 0. This has motivated the study of equations of state for turbulent gas that include a pressure proportional to the logarithm of the density, so-called logatropes (Lizano & Shu 1989, Gehman et al. 1996). McLaughlin & Pudritz (1996) pointed out a difficulty with previous logatropic models and developed a variant that overcame this problem; however, their model leads to linewidths that actually decrease near the edge of the cloud (McKee & Tan 2003). An alternative model for clouds in which the inner regions are supported by thermal pressure and the envelopes are supported by turbulent pressure is the TNT (thermal/nonthermal) model, in which the density is assumed to be given by the sum of two power-laws, one with k\\nρ = 2, representing a singular isothermal sphere (SIS), and one with k\\nρ < 2, representing a turbulent envelope (Myers & Fuller 1992, Caselli & Myers 1995). A more rigorous formulation of this type of model is that of a composite polytrope, in which the core and envelope of the cloud have different values of γp (Curry & McKee 2000).',\n",
       "  'Cosmological simulations show that self-gravitating, pressureless matter condenses into filamentary structures (e.g., Springel et al. 2005). This reflects the nature of evolution of cold, triaxial mass distributions under self-gravity (Lin, Mestel & Shu 1965): the first collapse is along the shortest axis, and the second collapse is along the (original) intermediate axis, resulting in a filament aligned along the (original) long axis. Molecular clouds often exhibit filamentary structure as well (Schneider & Elmegreen 1979; Mizuno et al. 1995; Nagahama et al. 1998; Lada, Alves & Lada 1999). This may reflect the effects of self-gravitational evolution, similar to cosmic structure formation. However, it may also reflect the effects of strongly supersonic turbulence. Converging turbulent flows produce curved sheets of shocked gas at stagnation surfaces, and the loci of these sheet intersections are filaments. The morphology of cold, diffuse HI is similar to that in GMCs (e.g., Heiles & Troland 2003, McClure-Griffiths et al. 2006), suggesting that at least some of the filamentary structure in star-forming clouds originates with multiscale supersonic turbulence; the filaments that are created by turbulent flows may also be (or become) self-gravitating.',\n",

       "  'The ISM is strongly magnetized, whereas stars are weakly magnetized. How the mass-to-flux ratio increases so dramatically during star formation is one of the classic problems of star formation (Mestel & Spitzer 1956). We shall characterize this ratio by the ratio of the mass to the magnetic critical mass for poloidal fields, μΦ ≡ M/M\\nΦ (Equation 16, Section 2.2).

It follows that the CNM is magnetically very subcritical, μΦ < 0.16 (throughout this section; we evaluate M\\nΦ with c\\nΦ = 1/2π, the value appropriate for sheets). There are thus two parts to the magnetic flux problem: How does the mass-to-flux ratio increase to μΦ ≳ 2 so that gravitational collapse can readily occur, and then how does it increase to the very large values (∼105 − 8) characteristic of stars?',\n",
       "  'Astronomers have two primary methods of measuring the strength of magnetic fields in the dense ISM: the Zeeman effect, which measures the line-of-sight component, B\\nlos; and the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method (Chandrasekhar & Fermi 1953), which measures the component of the field in the plane of the sky, B\\npos, by comparing the fluctuations in the direction of B\\npos with those in the velocity field (see the reviews by Crutcher 2005 and Heiles & Crutcher 2005; note that in the diffuse ISM, magnetic field strengths are also obtained by Faraday rotation and synchrotron observations, with results consistent with Zeeman observations). The morphology of the field, which is needed for the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method, can be measured from dust polarization and from linear polarization of spectral lines (Goldreich & Kylafis 1981). The largest compilation of magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds remains that of Crutcher (1999), although it must be noted that the median temperature of the regions with detected fields is 40 K, significantly greater than average. Inferring the intrinsic field strength and column density from measurements of the line-of-sight components is somewhat subtle (Heiles & Troland 2005); in particular, care must be exercised in evaluating the average value of B\\n∥/B using logarithmic values, because \\n\\n. However, it is straightforward to infer the median values: B\\nmed = 2B\\nlos, med and, for sheets, N\\nmed = N\\nlos, med/2. Most of the structures Crutcher (1999) studied are relatively dense cores, so it is plausible that they are not sheet-like; in that case, the median value of μΦ is 1.65±0.2 [Heiles & Crutcher 2005; note that the values in Crutcher (1999) are based on c\\nΦ = 0.12, whereas we are using c\\nΦ = 1/2π], the cores are supercritical, and the magnetic field is unable to significantly impede gravitational collapse. On the other hand, if the objects in his sample are, in fact, sheet-like, then the median value of μΦ is reduced to 0.8 and the typical core is about critical. However, it should be noted that none of the cores have observed line-of-sight fields strong enough to ensure that they are subcritical, and for many cases only upper limits on the magnetic field strength are obtained. Subsequent OH Zeeman observations by Bourke et al. (2001) have strengthened these conclusions, although these authors suggest that observations with higher spatial resolution are needed to determine whether the relatively low fields they infer (mostly upper limits) are in part due to variations in the field structure within the telescope beam.',\n",
       "  '\\nCrutcher (1999) also reached a number of other conclusions on the role of magnetic fields in cores and clumps within molecular clouds from his sample: the observed structures are in approximate virial equilibrium; the kinetic and magnetic energies are in approximate equipartition, as expected theoretically (Zweibel & McKee 1995); correspondingly, the Alfvén Mach number is \\n\\n; the observed motions are highly supersonic, with \\n\\n; and, to within the errors, B ∝ ρ1/2, which corresponds to a constant Alfvén velocity (for sources with measured fields, as opposed to upper limits, the average value is v\\nA ≃ 2 km s−1, as found previously by Heiles et al. 1993). Basu (2000) showed that the dispersion of the Alfvén Mach number is significantly less than that in the Alfvén velocity in this sample. He argued that a constant value of \\n\\n is to be expected if the clouds are strongly bound, so that the surface pressure is negligible, and if μΦ is about constant.

In regions with densities n\\nH ≈ 2 × 103 cm−3, the lowest for which molecular-line Zeeman observations are available, Crutcher (1999) reports line-of-sight magnetic field strengths of ≤21 μG. Allowing for an increase of up to a factor of two for projection effects, and for the fact that the mean magnetic field strength will not increase as the density is reduced by a factor of ∼10 to reach the volume-averaged value in GMCs, we infer that GMCs are supercritical. GMC magnetic fields are not too weak, however: 450 μm polarimetry of four GMCs shows that the orientation of the field appears to be preserved during the formation of the GMCs and that the energy in the field is comparable to the turbulent energy (Li et al. 2006).',\n",
       "  'Theoretical arguments are consistent with the empirical evidence that GMCs as well as their subparts are supercritical with respect to their mean magnetic fields. Models of self-gravitating, isothermal, magnetized clouds show that large pressure contrasts between the center of the cloud and the edge occur only when the cloud is near its critical mass; furthermore, if the kinetic energy is comparable to the magnetic energy, then large pressure contrasts occur only for M > M\\nΦ. Extending the earlier work of Mouschovias (1976), Tomisaka, Ikeuchi & Nakamura (1988) found that for the cases they considered with 8π P/B\\n2 = 1, the central pressure significantly exceeds the surface pressure only when M is quite close to M\\ncr, and that in these cases the cloud is magnetically supercritical, M > M\\nΦ. Using this work, McKee (1989) showed that the critical mass is M\\ncr ≃ M\\nΦ + M\\nBE for quiescent clouds; he assumed that this relation applies to turbulent clouds as well, with σth replaced by the total velocity dispersion σ, but the validity of this assumption remains to be demonstrated. Because, on large scales, the turbulent magnetic energy is likely comparable to or larger than the mean magnetic energy, and the kinetic energy is at least as large as the magnetic energy (and much greater than the thermal energy), then clouds with αvir ∼ 1 have M ≳ 2M\\nΦ. Nakano (1998) has given a similar, more precise argument that the smaller-scale and less-turbulent cores that form stars are also magnetically supercritical. In both cases, the basic argument is that if gravity is strong enough to overcome both kinetic energy (turbulent plus thermal) and magnetic fields (turbulent and ordered) in order to form a bound object, then it is certainly strong compared to the support from mean magnetic fields alone. Note that this argument does not apply to objects that are not bound, but instead are the result of colliding flows (Section 3.2.1). It is of great importance to determine observationally the relative importance of magnetic fields and gravity in the large-scale structure of molecular clouds.',\n",
       "  'Most detailed modeling of magnetic fields in nonturbulent clouds is based on the assumption that the field is poloidal (e.g., Mouschovias 1987); such fields always tend to support clouds against gravity. However, the toroidal component of a helical field exerts a confining force, and can lead to prolate clouds (Tomisaka 1991, Fiege & Pudritz 2000). From a virial analysis of several filamentary clouds, Fiege & Pudritz (2000) find that the self-gravity and the pressure of the ambient medium are inadequate to account for the high mean pressures that are observed in the clouds; they conclude that the data can be explained if these clouds are confined by helical fields. The principal uncertainty in this analysis is that in most cases there is no direct measurement of the ambient pressure.',\n",
       "  'There are two mechanisms for increasing the mass-to-flux ratio, flows along magnetic fields and ambipolar diffusion. In the part of a bound molecular cloud that is shielded from the interstellar radiation field so that the ionization is caused by cosmic rays, the ambipolar diffusion time is about 10 times the free-fall time in the absence of turbulence (Mouschovias 1987) and several times faster than this in the presence of turbulence (Fatuzzo & Adams 2002, Zweibel 2002, Nakamura & Li 2005). However, most of the mass of a GMC is ionized primarily by far ultraviolet (FUV) radiation from stars (McKee 1989), and in this gas the ambipolar diffusion time is much longer. GMCs are very porous, and as a result an even larger fraction of the volume of the cloud is likely to be ionized above the level set by cosmic rays. It follows that flux-freezing is a good approximation on large scales in molecular clouds. Mestel (1985) introduced the concept of the accumulation length, L\\n0, the size of the region required to achieve a given mass-to-flux ratio when flux-freezing applies, μΦ = M/M\\nΦ ∝ n\\n0\\nL\\n0/B\\n0\\n.

In fact, as we discuss in Section 3.2.1, GMC formation from large-scale self-gravitating galactic disk instabilities indeed involves very large accumulation lengths and yields supercritical clouds.',\n",
       "  'As discussed above, current observations do not determine whether ambipolar diffusion is necessary for the initiation of gravitational collapse. Theoretical simulations suggest that in the absence of ambipolar diffusion, star formation is strongly suppressed in magnetically subcritical regions, even if μΦ is only slightly less than unity (Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005). However, similar simulations show that magnetic fields have a relatively small effect in slowing the rate of star formation if the gas is supercritical (Ostriker, Gammie & Stone 1999; Heitsch, Mac Low & Klessen 2001; Li et al. 2004; Vázquez-Semadeni, Kim & Ballesteros-Paredes 2005; Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2005; Nakamura & Li 2005). The primary effect of magnetic fields may be to shift the initial collapse to higher masses. Simulations with ambipolar diffusion in weakly ionized plasmas are very challenging. In the strong-coupling approximation, in which the ions are not treated as a separate fluid but the field diffuses relative to the flow, explicit MHD codes have time steps ∝ Δ x\\n2, which is prohibitive at high resolution (Mac Low et al. 1995). If the ions are treated as a separate fluid, explicit codes must resolve Alfvén waves in the ions as well as Alfvén waves in the coupled ion-neutral fluid. For ionizations ≲ 10−6, the Alfvén velocity in the ions can exceed 103 km s−1, leading to very small time steps. A potential way around this problem is to increase the ion mass and decrease the ion-neutral coupling constant so that the momentum exchange rate between the ions and neutrals is unchanged (Li, McKee & Klein et al. 2006; Oishi & Mac Low 2006).',\n",
       "  'One regime in which ambipolar diffusion (or the lack of it) could have a strong effect on the star-formation rate (SFR) is in the outer layers of GMCs, which are dominated by FUV ionization. FUV photoionization slows ambipolar diffusion, and therefore star formation, when it dominates cosmic-ray ionization, which occurs for visual extinctions AV\\n ≲ 4 mag from the surface or ∼8 mag along a line of sight through the cloud (McKee 1989). Suppression of star formation in the outer layers of GMCs has been confirmed in the L1630 region of Orion (Li, Evans & Lada 1997) and in Taurus (Onishi et al. 1998). To the extent that ambipolar diffusion is essential for forming molecular cores, the absence or near absence of submillimeter cores in the outer layers of Ophiuchus (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004) and Perseus (Hatchell et al. 2005, Enoch et al. 2006) is qualitatively consistent with this prediction. On the other hand, Strom, Strom & Merrill (1993) find that there is a substantial distributed population of young stars in L1641, although this population is relatively old (5–7 Myr).',\n",
       "  'The chemistry of molecular clouds is a full subject in its own right. Here we summarize several developments that affect the ionization, which governs the coupling between the gas and the magnetic field. (a) Photodissociation regions (PDRs) are regions of the ISM that are predominantly neutral and in which the chemistry and heating are predominantly due to FUV radiation (see the review by Hollenbach & Tielens 1999). Most of the nonstellar IR radiation and most of the millimeter and submillimeter CO emission in galaxies originates in PDRs. In the typical interstellar radiation field, photoionization dominates ionization by cosmic rays for extinctions AV\\n < 4 mag, which includes most of the molecular gas in the Galaxy (McKee 1989). (b) PAHs, which contain a few percent of the carbon atoms, often dominate the mid-IR spectrum of star-forming regions and galaxies. It is frequently assumed that PAHs have a low abundance in molecular clouds owing to accretion onto dust grains; if this is not the case, they can dominate the ionization balance, because electrons react with them very rapidly (Lepp et al. 1988). (c) H3\\n+ is a critical ion in initiating ion-molecule reactions in molecular clouds. For many years, the rate of dissociative recombination, H3\\n+ + e → H2 + H or H + H + H, was uncertain, but careful laboratory experiments have shown that the rate coefficient for this reaction is large: a fit to the results of McCall et al. (2003) gives \\n\\n cm3 s−1. In order to maintain the observed abundance of H3\\n+ in the face of this high recombination rate, these authors inferred a very high cosmic-ray ionization rate, ζCR = 6 × 10−16 s−1 per H atom (including secondary ionizations), in a diffuse molecular cloud along the line of sight to ζ Per. Models involving two gas phases give somewhat lower values of ζCR (e.g., Dalgarno 2006), but the correct value is now quite uncertain. In dense clouds, Dalgarno (2006) concludes that the ionization rate is ζCR ≃ 2.5 − 5 × 10−17 s−1. (d) Recent observations have established that carbon-bearing molecules freeze out onto dust grains at high densities (n\\nH ∼ 105 cm−3) in low-mass cores, with nitrogen-bearing molecules freezing out at higher densities (Di Francesco et al. 2007). This affects the ionization, as it removes abundant ions such as HCO+ from the gas.',\n",
       "  'Although the chemistry determining the ionization in molecular clouds is complex, simple analytic estimates are possible. In the outer layers of PDRs, carbon is photoionized so that ne\\n ≃ n (C). In regions ionized by cosmic rays, the degree of ionization is given by',\n",

If PAHs are depleted, then α ≃ 10−6 cm3 s−1 is the dissociative recombination rate for heavy molecules provided the density is high enough that H3\\n+ is destroyed primarily by reactions with such molecules; for lower densities, where the ionization is dominated by H3\\n+, one has α = α\\nd\\n (H3\\n+). If PAHs are sufficiently abundant that most of the electrons are attached to PAHs, then α ≃ 3 × 10−7 cm3 s−1 (Tielens 2005) and ne\\n in Equation 24 includes the electrons attached to PAHs. Metal ions can be readily included in the analytic theory (McKee 1989), but they do not appear to be important in dense cores (Maret, Bergin & Lada 2006).

       "  'The molecular gas out of which stars form is found in molecular clouds, which occupy a small fraction of the volume of the ISM but, inside the solar circle, comprise a significant fraction of the mass. The terminology for the structure of molecular clouds is not fixed; here we follow the discussion in Williams, Blitz & McKee (2000). GMCs have masses in excess of 104 M⊙ and contain most of the molecular mass. Molecular clouds have a hierarchical structure that extends from the scale of the cloud down to the thermal Jeans mass in the case of gravitationally bound clouds, and down to much smaller masses for unbound structures (Langer et al. 1995, Heithausen et al. 1998). Overdense regions (at a range of scales) within GMCs are termed clumps. Star-forming clumps are the massive clumps out of which stellar clusters form, and they are generally gravitationally bound. Cores are the regions out of which individual stars (or small multiple systems like binaries) form, and are necessarily gravitationally bound. As remarked above, this terminology is not universal; e.g., Ward-Thompson et al. (2007) use “prestellar core” to refer to a core, and “cluster-forming core” to refer to a star-forming clump.',\n",
       "  'A molecular cloud is surrounded by a layer of atomic gas that shields the molecules from the interstellar UV radiation field; in the solar vicinity, this layer is observed to have a column density N\\nH ≃ 2 × 1020 cm−2, corresponding to a visual extinction AV\\n = 0.1 mag (Bohlin, Savage & Drake 1978). A larger column density, N\\nH ≃ 1.4 × 1021 cm−2, is required for CO to form (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). The layer of gas in which the hydrogen is molecular but the carbon is atomic is difficult to observe, and has been termed “dark gas” (Grenier, Casandjian & Terrier 2005).',\n",
       "  'The mass of a molecular cloud is generally inferred from its luminosity in the J = 1 − 0 line of 12CO or 13CO. Because 12CO is optically thick, estimating the column density of H2 molecules from the 12CO line intensity I\\nCO (in units of K km s−1) requires multiplication by an “X-factor,” an appropriate name because it is not well understood theoretically; this is defined as X ≡ N(H2)/I\\nCO. Various methods have been used to infer the value of X in the Galaxy: In one method, observations of γ rays emitted by cosmic rays interacting with the ISM give the total amount of interstellar matter; the mass of molecular gas follows by subtracting the neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) contribution. With this technique, Strong & Mattox (1996) infer X = 1.9 × 1020 cm−2(K km s−1)−1. In another method, subtracting the HI-associated dust emission from the total observed dust emission in the IR gives a local value X = 1.8 × 1020 cm−2(K km s−1)−1 (Dame, Hartmann & Thaddeus 2001). Note that both of these methods account for all the molecular hydrogen gas, including the dark gas. Allowing for the atomic shielding layer around a molecular cloud (but not the dark-gas layer), Elmegreen (1989) predicted \\nX ∝ (G\\n0/Z)3/8/Tb\\n\\n, where G\\n0 is proportional to the intensity of FUV radiation that can photodissociate H2, Z is the metallicity, and Tb\\n is the brightness temperature of the line. Maloney & Black (1988) concluded that Tb\\n should be substantially reduced in regions of low metallicity. Observing the 13CO line is advantageous in that it is optically thin in all but the high-density cores. Conversion from 13CO intensity to column density involves an assumption of LTE (using temperatures derived from 12CO), and a fixed H2 to 13CO abundance. Because 13CO may be subthermally excited in diffuse regions, however, column densities there will be underestimated. Near-IR extinction mapping (Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007) offers the prospect of obtaining more accurate masses, at least for nearby molecular clouds.',\n",
       "  'The observed mass distribution of GMCs is a power-law with a relatively sharp cutoff. Let \\n\\n be the number of GMCs with masses in the range M to M + dM.

With \\n\\n, α = 0.6, and Mu\\n = 6 × 106\\nM\\n⊙, this cloud mass distribution accounts for all the molecular mass observed inside the solar circle excluding the Galactic Center. An independent analysis by Rosolowsky (2005) finds a similar slope (α = 0.5 ± 0.1), but a somewhat smaller maximum mass (Mu\\n = 3 × 106\\nM\\n⊙, although this does not include the several most massive clouds). These results are necessarily approximate owing to the difficulties in identifying clouds from position-velocity data in the inner Galaxy—in particular, blending of clouds along the line of sight is likely to make the true value of the slope steeper (Rosolowsky 2005). However, the main implications are likely to be robust. First, most of the mass in GMCs is in large clouds—a significant fraction is in clouds with M > 106\\nM\\n⊙, and >80% is in clouds with M > 105\\nM\\n⊙ (see also Stark & Lee 2006). And second, because \\n\\n, the upper limit of the mass distribution, Mu\\n, has a physical significance (McKee & Williams 1997). If there were no cutoff to the distribution, one would expect about 100 GMCs more massive than 6 × 106\\nM\\n⊙ in the Galaxy, whereas there are none. This upper mass limit may be set by the processes that form GMCs out of diffuse gas (see Section 3.2.1). It should be noted that the GMCs are embedded in more massive HI superclouds (sometimes encompassing multiple GMCs), which also appear to be gravitationally bound (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1987). In other Local Group galaxies, GMC mass distributions have similar power-laws to that in the Milky Way, with the exception of M33, which has \\n\\n (Blitz et al. 2007).

       "  \"In a seminal paper, Larson (1981) summarized some of the key dynamical features of GMCs in what are often referred to as Larson's laws. The first result is that GMCs obey a linewidth-size relation: GMCs are supersonically turbulent with velocity dispersions that increase as a power of the size. For GMCs in the first Galactic quadrant, almost all of which are inside the solar circle, Solomon et al. (1987) found\",\n",

Heyer & Brunt (2004) find that this cloud-to-cloud relation extends to the structure functions within individual GMCs as well (see Equation 6 in Section 2.1.5), and argue that this demonstrates the universality of the turbulence in moderate-density gas in molecular clouds (see below).',\n",
       "  \"Larson's second law is that GMCs are gravitationally bound (αvir ≃ 1; see Equation 11). (It should be noted that though molecular gas is generally bound in the Galaxy, different physical conditions can lead to substantial amounts of unbound molecular gas or bound atomic gas—Elmegreen 1993b.) Solomon et al. (1987) determined the masses of clouds in their sample using the virial theorem with αvir = 1.1, and then determined the X-factor. Including He and adjusting the distance to the Galactic Center to 8.5 kpc from 10 kpc, their value of the X-factor corresponding to a typical GMC with a mass of 106\\nM\\n⊙ (see above) is 1.9 × 1020 cm−2(K km s−1)−1, the same as the value determined from γ-ray observations; hence, the GMCs in their sample are gravitationally bound on average. (Note that this argument is approximate because the γ-ray value for the X-factor includes the dark gas, whereas the value from the virial theorem includes only part of this gas, depending on the morphology of the GMC.) Observations of 13CO, which is optically thin, permit a direct measurement of the mass, provided the abundance is known. Such observations of a sample of GMCs in the outer Galaxy, where blending of different clouds along the line of sight is negligible, confirm that molecular clouds with M ≳ 104\\nM\\n⊙ (i.e., GMCs) are bound (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001). Lower mass clouds become progressively less bound (see also Maloney 1990), and unbound molecular clouds are for many purposes equivalent to nonself-gravitating clumps within larger GMCs. Based on observations in 13CO and other species that are believed to be optically thin, clump mass functions within GMCs follow \\n\\n with αclump = 0.3 − 0.7 (Blitz 1993; Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994). The slope of the clump mass function is similar to that for GMCs as a whole (see Equation 25), possibly because both are determined by turbulent processes within larger, gravitationally bound systems.\",\n",
       "  \"Larson's third law is that GMCs all have similar column densities. For the Solomon et al.

Observations supporting a universal turbulence law (Equation 6) in the Galaxy, and thus small differences in σpc between inner- and outer-Galaxy GMCs (Heyer & Brunt 2004; Heyer, Williams & Brunt 2006) imply that the value of Σ is about the same for all GMCs with αvir ∼ 1, regardless of Galactic location. Observational confirmation of this conclusion would be valuable. Provided Larson's Laws apply, the mean kinetic pressure within GMCs is independent of mass and size, and is given by \\n\\n.

       "  \"Do Larson's laws apply in other galaxies? Blitz et al. (2007) summarize observations of GMCs in galaxies in the Local Group, in which the metallicity varies over the range (0.1 − 1) solar. They find that the GMCs in most of these galaxies would have luminous masses within a factor two of their virial masses if X = 4 × 1020 cm−2 (K km s−1)−1; alternatively, if X has the same value as in the Galaxy, then the GMCs are only marginally bound (αvir ≃ 2). They conclude that metallicity does not have a significant effect on X because the ratio of the virial mass to the CO luminosity is constant in M33, despite a factor of 10 variation in metallicity. (Note, however, that Elmegreen 1989 argues that X depends on the ratio of the metallicity to the intensity of the FUV radiation field, which is not addressed by these results.) Although there is insufficient dynamic range for clear evidence of a relationship between linewidth and size based on current observations, the data are consistent with σ ∝ R\\n1/2 but with values of σpc (and therefore ℓ\\ns\\n) that vary from galaxy to galaxy. Blitz et al. (2007) also find that GMC surface densities have a relatively small range within any given Local Group galaxy, and vary from ∼50 M\\n⊙ pc−2 for the SMC (L. Blitz, personal communication) to >100 M\\n⊙ pc−2 for M33.\",\n",
       "  'There are currently two main conceptual frameworks for interpreting the data on GMC properties. One conception of GMCs is that they are dynamic, transient entities in which the turbulence is driven by large-scale colliding gas flows that create the cloud (e.g., Heitsch et al. 2005, Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2006, Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). This picture naturally explains why GMCs are turbulent (at least in the initial stages), and why the linewidth-size relation within clouds has an exponent of 1/2—simply due to the scaling properties of supersonic turbulence. However, it is less obvious why αvir ∼ 1 and why Σ has a particular value, because small-scale dense structures may form (and collapse) at stagnation points in a high-velocity compressive flow before sufficient material has collected to create a large-scale GMC. Indeed, based on simulations with a converging flow of ∼20 km s−2 with no stellar feedback, Vázquez-Semadeni et al. (2007) find that star formation occurs when the column density is NH\\n ≈ 1021 cm−2, a factor of 10 below the mean observed value for GMCs. They also find that αvir remains near unity after self-gravity becomes important, although the kinetic energy is primarily due to the gravitational collapse of the cloud, not to internal turbulence. Zuckerman & Palmer (1974) argued many years ago that GMCs cannot be in a state of global collapse without leading to an unrealistically high SFR. Proponents of the transient GMC picture counter by pointing out that most of the gas in GMCs is unbound and never forms stars (e.g., Clark et al. 2005); the global collapse is reversed by feedback from stars that form in the fraction of the gas that is overdense and bound. Indeed, individual star formation proceeds more rapidly than global collapse in essentially all turbulent simulations (see also Section 3.2.2). However, dominance of global collapse and expansion over large-scale random turbulent motions has not been confirmed from observations.',\n",
       "  'In the second conceptual framework, GMCs are formed by large-scale self-gravitating instabilities (see Section 3.2.1), and the turbulence they contain is due to a combination of inheritance from the diffuse ISM, conversion of gravitational energy to turbulent energy during contraction, and energy injection from newly formed stars (Section 3.2.2); the balance among these terms presumably shifts in time. In the work of Chièze (1987), Elmegreen (1989), Maloney (1988), McKee & Holliman (1999), and McKee (1999), GMCs are treated as quasi-equilibrium, self-gravitating objects, so that the virial parameter is near-unity by definition. Whether or not equilibrium holds, the virial parameter is initially of order unity in scenarios involving gravitational instability because GMCs separate from the diffuse ISM as defined structures when they become gravitationally bound. For a quasi-equilibrium, the mean surface density is set by the pressure of the ambient ISM (see Section 2.2), which in turn is just the weight of the overlying ISM. Elmegreen (1989) has given explicit expressions for how the coefficient in the linewidth-size relation and the surface density depend on the external pressure, finding results that are comparable with observed values. In particular, the cloud surface density scales with the mean surrounding surface density of the ISM. Even if GMCs are not equilibria, if they are formed due to self-gravitating instabilities in spiral arms (e.g., Kim & Ostriker 2002, 2006) they must initially have surface densities a factor of a few above the mean arm gas density, consistent with observations. Provided that stellar feedback destroys clouds within a few (large-scale) dynamical times before gravitational collapse accelerates, the mean surface density would never greatly exceed the value at the time of formation. Simple models of cloud evolution with stellar feedback (e.g., Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006) suggest that the scenario of slow evolution with αvir = 1 − 2 is self-consistent and yields realistic star-formation efficiencies, but more complete studies are needed.',\n",
       "  'The two approaches to interpreting GMC dynamics correspond to two alternate views on GMC lifetimes. Elmegreen (2000) argued that, over a wide range of scales, star formation occurs in about 1 − 2 dynamical crossing times of the system, \\n\\n. Ballesteros-Paredes, Hartmann & Vázquez-Semadeni (1999) and Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin (2001) focused on the particular case of star formation in Taurus, and argued that it occurred in about one dynamical time. The alternate view is that GMCs are gravitationally bound and live at least 2 − 3, and possibly more, crossing times, t\\ncross ≃ 10M\\n6\\n1/4 Myr, where M\\n6 ≡ M/(106\\nM\\n⊙) and a virial parameter αvir ∼ 1 = 2 is assumed (Palla & Stahler 2000; Huff & Stahler 2006; Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006; note that the crossing time in the nearby star-forming region in Taurus is ∼106 years, whereas in a large GMC it is ∼107 years). However, GMCs (as opposed to structures within them) cannot be too close to being equilibria, because they do not appear to have a systematic, global density stratification, nor does the linewidth-size relation within individual clouds differ from that in unstratified clouds. (Note that logatropic clouds can account for the observed relation δ v ∝ ℓ1/2 only if they are unbound—see Section 2.2). Estimates (empirical and theoretical) of GMC lifetimes are discussed in Section 3.2.2. It should be borne in mind that the difference between the two scenarios is only a factor of ∼2 − 3 for GMC lifetimes, which makes it difficult to obtain an unambiguous observational resolution purely based on timescales. However, there are major physical distinctions between the limiting cases of the scenarios that are under consideration—e.g., collapse triggered in colliding flows versus a quasi-steady state supported by internally driven turbulence. As complete numerical simulations are developed to flesh out the current proposals, it will be possible to distinguish among them using detailed kinematic observations.',\n",

       "  \"The physical conditions in clumps and cores have been thoroughly reviewed by Di Francesco et al. (2007) and Ward-Thompson et al. (2007), and we address only a few issues here. First, how well are Larson's laws obeyed in clumps and cores? Most 13CO clumps are unbound, and therefore do not obey Larson's laws (e.g., Carr 1987); the mass distribution of such clumps can extend in an unbroken power-law from several tens of solar masses down to Jupiter masses (Heithausen et al. 1998). However, Bertoldi & McKee (1992) found that most of the mass in the clouds is concentrated in the most massive clumps, and these appear to be gravitationally bound. The virial parameter for the unbound clumps decreases with increasing mass, in a manner similar to that observed for both the small molecular clouds and clumps within GMCs in the outer Galaxy (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001). They found that the velocity dispersion in the unbound clumps is approximately independent of clump mass (or, because the clump density is also about constant in each cloud, of clump size): the unbound clumps do not obey a linewidth-size relation. Heyer, Carpenter & Snell (2001) find the same result for clumps in the outer Galaxy. By contrast, Falgarone, Puget & Perault (1992) found that unbound clumps do obey a line width–size relation, albeit with considerable scatter. Bertoldi & McKee (1992) showed that the kinetic pressure in the unbound clumps in their study is comparable to that in the host molecular cloud, which is P ≃ GΣMC\\n2 (Equation 12). Further evidence on whether clumps or cores are bound is imprinted in their shapes and density structure and is discussed below.\",\n",
       "  'It is difficult to determine from the data whether there is a linewidth-size relation within individual clumps and cores. For low-mass cores, Barranco & Goodman (1998) (see also Goodman et al. 1998, Tafalla et al. 2004) found that the nonthermal linewidth decreases and then reaches a minimum plateau level at a finite impact parameter ∼ 0.1 pc from the center of the core. Because of projection effects, however, it is not possible to determine whether the observed turbulence pervades the whole volume interior to that radial impact parameter, or whether the turbulence is primarily in a shell surrounding a more quiescent core; it is also possible that the nonthermal linewidth is due to coherent oscillations of the cores (Keto et al. 2006). A linewidth-size relation in the ensemble of different gravitationally bound clumps and cores is expected only if they have similar surface densities (Equation 27). Jijina, Myers & Adams (1999) carried out a comprehensive study of cores and star-forming clumps (in our terminology; dense cores in theirs) observed in NH3 and found that the objects with and without associated IRAS (Infrared Astronomical Satellite) sources each obeyed a nonthermal linewidth-size relation with slopes of about 0.5 and 0.8, respectively. When the sample was divided into objects associated with or without clusters (defined as having at least 30 embedded YSOs), the cluster sample had a weak correlation between linewidth and size with a slope of only about 0.2, whereas the noncluster sample had a stronger correlation with a slope of about 0.6. However, as remarked above, Heyer, Carpenter & Snell (2001) found no evidence for a linewidth-size relation for small (<104\\nM\\n⊙) molecular clouds in the outer Galaxy; furthermore, they did not find evidence for a constant surface density at any mass. Plume et al. (1997) observed a sample of clumps that are forming high-mass stars, and did not find a linewidth-size relation.',\n",
       "  'The lack of an observed linewidth-size relation in observed unbound clumps within a given cloud is at first puzzling, because defined volumes should sample from the overall structure function of the GMC, which follows δ v ∝ ℓ0.5 (Section 2.1.5). Analysis of turbulence simulations offers a resolution to this puzzle, suggesting that many apparent clumps in moderate-density tracers such as 13CO are not, in fact, single physical entities. Observationally, clumps are generally identified as connected overdense peaks in position-velocity data cubes, with the line-of-sight velocity acting as a surrogate for line-of-sight position. Analysis of simulations shows, however, that many position-velocity clumps in fact consist of separate physical structures superimposed on the sky; correspondingly, many physically coherent structures have two or more separate components when observed in line-of-sight velocity (Pichardo et al. 2000; Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Ballesteros-Paredes & Mac Low 2002). Because low-contrast apparent clumps with any plane-of-sky size may sample from the velocity field along the whole line of sight, the linewidth varies only very weakly with size. Because a fraction of the apparent clumps sample velocities from a range of line-of-sight distances no larger than their transverse extent, however, Ostriker, Stone & Gammie (2001) argued that the lower envelope of the clump linewidth-size distribution should follow the scaling defined by the true 3D power spectrum; this is generally consistent with observations (Stutzki & Guesten 1990; Williams, de Geus & Blitz 1994).',\n",
       "  \"What about Larson's third law? Because gravitationally bound clumps have P ≃ GΣbd clump\\n2, and the mean pressure in a stable, bound clump without an internal energy source cannot be much greater than the ambient pressure, it follows that typically Σbd clump is comparable to ΣGMC (e.g., McKee 1999). The high-mass, star-forming clumps studied by Plume et al. (1997) violate this conclusion: They have \\n\\n with considerable dispersion, which is much greater than the typical GMC surface density ∼170 M\\n⊙ pc−2. There are several possible explanations for this, and it is important to determine which is correct: Are these clumps just the innermost, densest parts of much larger clumps? Do they have much higher pressures than their surroundings but are avoiding gravitational collapse owing to energy injection from star formation? Or are they the result of a clump-clump collision that produced unusually high pressures?\",\n",
       "  'The density structure, velocity structure, and shape of cores offer potential means for determining whether they are dynamic objects, with short lifetimes, or quasi-equilibrium, gravitationally bound, objects. The observation of the Bok globule B68 in near-IR absorption revealed an angle-averaged density profile consistent with that of a Bonnor-Ebert sphere to high accuracy (Alves, Lada & Lada 2001). Since then, a number of other isolated globules and cores have been studied with the same technique and fit to Bonnor-Ebert profiles, showing that starless cases are usually close to the critical limit, whereas cases with stars often match supercritical profiles (Teixeira, Lada & Alves 2005; Kandori et al. 2005). Profiles of dense cores have also been obtained using submillimeter dust emission (see Di Francesco et al. 2007). A recent study by Kirk, Ward-Thompson & André (2005) found that bright starless cores have density profiles consistent with supercritical Bonnor-Ebert spheres.',\n",
       "  'Consistency of density profiles with the Bonnor-Ebert profile does not, however, necessarily imply that a core is bound. Analysis of dense concentrations that arise in turbulence simulations show that Bonnor-Ebert profiles often provide a good fit to these structures (provided they are averaged over angles), even when they are transients rather than true bound cores (Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 2007). Even if a cloud with a Bonnor-Ebert profile is bound, however, it need not be in equilibrium: Myers (2005) and Kandori et al. (2005) have shown that density profiles of collapsing cores initiated from near-critical equilibria in fact follow the shapes of static supercritical equilibria very closely. The reason for this is that initially these cores collapse slowly, so that they are approximately in equilibrium; at later times, they evolve via “outside-in” collapse to a state that is marginally Jeans unstable everywhere (ρ ∝ r\\n−2—Section 4.1) except in a central core, which is similar to the density profile of a highly supercritical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. Thus, not only the density structure but also the level of the internal velocity dispersion and detailed shape of the line profiles must be used in order to distinguish between transient, truly equilibrium, and collapsing objects (Keto & Field 2005).',\n",
       "  'Core shapes also provide information on whether cores are transient or are bound, quasi-equilibrium objects. In the absence of a magnetic field, a quasi-equilibrium, bound cloud is approximately spherical. If the cloud is threaded by a magnetic field that tends to support the cloud against gravity, it will be oblate; if the field tends to compress the cloud (as is possible for some helical fields–Fiege & Pudritz 2000), it will be prolate. If one assumes axisymmetry, the distribution of observed axis ratios implies dense cores are primarily prolate (Ryden 1996). However, this conclusion appears to be an artifact of the assumption of axisymmetry: using the method of analysis for triaxial clouds developed by Basu (2000) and Jones, Basu & Dubinski (2001), Jones & Basu (2002) concluded that cores with sizes <1 pc are, in fact, oblate. Basu (2000) showed that if the magnetic field is aligned with the minor axis, as in most quasi-equilibrium models, the projection of the field on the plane of the sky will not generally be aligned with the projection of the minor axis, and he argued that the limited polarization data available are consistent with the theoretical expectation that the field in the cloud is aligned with the minor axis of the cloud. Kerton et al. (2003) showed that larger structures, extending up to GMCs, are intermediate between oblate and prolate, and are clearly distinct from the smaller objects. This is consistent with the analyses of clump shapes in turbulence simulations by Gammie et al. (2003), and Li et al. (2004), who found that the majority of objects are triaxial. The data on cores and small clumps are thus consistent with (but do not prove) that they are bound, quasi-equilibrium objects. Large clumps and GMCs appear to be farther from equilibrium.',\n",
       "  'A key feature of the cores that form individual low-mass stars is that they have low nonthermal velocities, whether these cores are found in isolation or clustered with other cores (Di Francesco et al. 2007, Ward-Thompson et al. 2007). The mean 1D velocity dispersion in starless cores based on the sample of Benson & Myers (1989) is 0.11 km s−1, such that the 3D velocity dispersion is approximately sonic. This places constraints on theoretical models, and in particular may constrain the nature of turbulent driving. Klessen et al. (2005) compared the results for cores identified in two (unmagnetized) simulations with the same RMS Mach number ≈10, one driven on large scales and the other driven on small scales; the time correlation of the driving force is short for both cases. They found that only with large-scale driving is the mean turbulence level within cores approximately sonic; in the small-scale driving case the preponderance of cores are supersonic. Klessen et al. (2005) also found that the starless cores in their large-scale-driving models are within a factor of a few of kinetic and gravitational energy equipartition. In the 2D MHD simulations of Nakamura & Li (2005) that implement driving by instantaneous injection of radial wind momentum when (low-mass) stars are formed, the dense cores that are identified also primarily have subsonic internal motions. Importantly, both types of models show that dense, quiescent cores can form in a turbulent environment; the slow, diffusive formation of quiescent cores central to the older picture of star formation does not seem to be required.',\n",
       "  'What happens to dense cores once they form? Cores that have sufficient internal turbulence compared to their self-gravity will redisperse within a crossing time. Cores that reach low enough turbulence and magnetization levels (allowing for dissipation) within a few local free-fall times will collapse if M > M\\ncr. Vázquez-Semadeni et al. (2005) found that in globally supercritical 3D simulations with driven turbulence, cores that collapse do so within 3–6 local free-fall times of their formation. Nakamura & Li (2005) found via 2D simulations including ambipolar diffusion that even when the mass in the simulation volume is 20% less than critical, supercritical cores can form; these then either collapse or redisperse within several local free-fall times. In both cases (see also Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005), only magnetically supercritical cores collapse, as expected. Quiescent cores that are stable against gravitational collapse could in principle survive for a long time (Lizano & Shu 1989), undergoing oscillations in response to fluctuations in the ambient medium (Keto & Field 2005, Keto et al. 2006). Because they are only lightly bound, however, such failed cores can also be destroyed relatively easily by the larger-scale, more powerful turbulence in the surrounding GMC. This process is clearly seen in numerical simulations; Vázquez-Semadeni et al. (2005) and Nakamura & Li (2005) found that the bound cores that subsequently disperse do so in 1–6 × t\\nff. Quiescent, magnetically subcritical cores with thermal pressure ρcore\\ncs\\n\\n2 exceeding the mean turbulent pressure \\n\\n (so that the core would collapse in the absence of magnetic support) cannot easily be destroyed, however, and it is likely that they remain intact until they merge with other cores to become supercritical. Simulations have not yet afforded sufficient statistics to determine the mean time to collapse or dispersal as a function of core properties and cloud turbulence level, or whether there is a threshold density above which ultimate collapse is inevitable.',\n",
       "  'Observationally, core lifetimes can be estimated by using chemical clocks or from statistical inference. The formation of complex molecules takes ∼105 years at typical core densities, but this clock can be reset by events that bring fresh C and C+ into the core, such as turbulence or outflows (Langer et al. 2000). A potentially more robust clock is provided by observations of cold HI in cores: Goldsmith & Li (2005) infer ages of 106.5−7 years for five dark clouds from the low observed values of the H0/H2 ratio. These age estimates would be reduced if clumping is significant and hence the time-averaged molecule formation rate is accelerated, but, as in the case of complex molecules, they would be increased if turbulent mixing were effective in bringing in fresh atomic hydrogen. In simulations of molecule formation in a turbulent (and therefore clumpy) medium, Glover & Mac Low (2007) find that H2 formation is indeed accelerated when compared with the nonturbulent case, although the atomic fractions they found are substantially greater than those observed by Goldsmith & Li (2005). If confirmed, these ages, which are considerably greater than a free-fall time, would suggest that these dark clouds are quasi-equilibrium structures.',\n",
       "  'Statistical studies of core lifetimes are based on comparing the number of starless cores with the number of cores with embedded YSOs and the number of visible T Tauri stars (TTSs). The ages of the cores (starless and with embedded YSOs) can then be inferred from the ages of the T Tauri population, provided that most of the observed starless cores will eventually become stars. The results of several such studies have been summarized by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007), who conclude that lifetimes are typically 3 − 5 t\\nff for starless cores with densities n\\nH2\\n = 103.5 − 105.5 cm−3. This is not consistent with dynamical collapse, nor is it consistent with a long period (> 5 t\\nff) of ambipolar diffusion. It is consistent with the ambipolar diffusion in observed magnetic fields (Section 2.3), which are approximately magnetically critical. Of course, cores are created with a range of properties, and observational statistics are subject to an evolutionary selection effect: Cores that are born or become supercritical evolve rapidly into collapse, and are no longer counted among the starless population. Given a population with a range of intrinsic lifetimes (but similar birth rates), the longest-lived objects will be the best represented. The data rule out the possibility that most cores are born very subcritical and lose their magnetic flux slowly, over ∼10t\\nff.',\n",
       "  'The angular momentum of cores was initially regarded as a bottleneck for star formation, but extensive theoretical analysis led to the conclusion that magnetic fields would provide an effective braking mechanism (e.g., Mestel 1985; Mouschovias 1987). Observations have established that the angular momentum, or equivalently, the rotational energy, of cores is indeed small (e.g., Goodman et al. 1993; Jijina, Myers & Adams 1999; Caselli et al. 2002; Pirogov et al. 2003). Goodman et al. (1993) characterized the rotational energy by the parameter',\n",

The specific angular momenta j in this sample range from 6 × 1020 − 4 × 1022 cm2 s−1 and increase with size approximately as j ∝ R\\n3/2. Interestingly enough, Burkert & Bodenheimer (2000) showed that rotation arising from sampling turbulent fluctuations with a Burgers power spectrum (and normalization matched to observations) is adequate to account for the observations; in this picture, the role of magnetic braking on small scales is unclear. (However, magnetic braking appears to be clearly significant in regulating the spin of GMAs and hence GMCs—Rosolowsky et al. 2003; Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2003). Because j ∝ vR and v ∝ R\\n1/2 for large-scale turbulence, the observed j ∝ R\\n3/2 relation is what would be expected if core turbulence scales similarly. Li et al. (2004) indeed find agreement with this scaling from cores identified in their simulations. Gammie et al. (2003) and Jappsen et al.

(2005) show that if the mean density is adjusted so that core masses match those in observed regions, then the mean angular momentum distributions match as well. For cores that collapse, Jappsen et al. (2005) also found that the distributions of βrot are similar to those obtained by Goodman et al. (1993).',\n",
       "  'In principle, GMCs could form either by bottom-up or by top-down processes. In bottom-up formation, successive inelastic collisions of cold HI clouds would gradually increase the mean cloud size and mass until that of a (self-gravitating) GMC is reached (e.g., Field & Saslaw 1965, Kwan 1979). The difficulty with this coagulation scenario, as was recognized early, is that it is very slow; e.g., Kwan (1979) found that the time needed for the peak of the mass distribution to exceed 105\\nM\\n⊙ is more than 2 × 108 years. The binary collision time for spherical clouds of radius R\\ncl and density ρcl is \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is the density averaged over large scales and σ is the 1D velocity dispersion over the mean intercloud separation (see Binney & Tremaine 1987, Equation 8–122; note that for considering agglomeration we neglect grazing collisions, choosing a maximum impact parameter R\\ncl). Expressed in terms of the cloud gathering scale \\n\\n in the diffuse ISM, or in terms of the cloud surface density \\n\\n, the collision time is',\n",
       "  'The mean intercloud separation is comparable to 2R\\ngath, which exceeds the atomic disk scale height H ≈ 150 pc (Malhotra 1995) for \\n\\n. We can use Equation 31 to estimate the collision time if all the diffuse ISM gas were apportioned into equal-mass clouds with equal surface density. Using \\n\\n for the nonthermal velocity dispersion in the diffuse ISM at large (≳ H) scales (Heiles & Troland 2003), Σcl ≈ 170 M\\n⊙ pc−2 for the mean GMC column (Solomon et al. 1987), and mean density of \\n\\n typical of the diffuse ISM at the Solar circle (Dickey & Lockman 1990), this yields a collision timescale >5 × 108 years. Gravitational focusing in principle decreases the cloud-cloud collision time, but in practice this does not help in forming GMCs from atomic clouds because the reduction factor for the collision time, [1 + π GR\\ncl Σcl/σ2]−1, is near unity until the clouds are quite massive (≳ 105\\nM\\n⊙). Even if the background density were arbitrarily (and unrealistically) enhanced by a factor of 100 to approach ρcl, the total time of 40 Myr required to build clouds from 104\\nM\\n⊙ to 5 × 106\\nM\\n⊙ (by successive stages of collisions) would still exceed the estimated GMC lifetimes. These lifetimes are set by the time required to destroy clouds by a combination of photodissociation and mechanical unbinding by expanding HII regions (see Section 3.2.2). Thus, if coagulation were the only way to build GMCs, the process would be truncated by destructive star formation before achieving the high GMC masses in which most molecular mass is actually found.',\n",
       "  'Given the timescale problem and other difficulties of bottom-up GMC formation (e.g., Blitz & Shu 1980), starting in the 1980s the focus shifted to top-down mechanisms involving large-scale instabilities in the diffuse ISM (e.g., Elmegreen 1979, 1995). The two basic physical processes that could trigger growth of massive GMCs involve (a) differential vertical buoyancy of varying-density regions along magnetic field lines parallel to the midplane, or (b) differential in-plane self-gravity of regions with varying surface density. The first type of instability is generically termed a Parker instability (Parker 1966). The second type of instability is generically a Jeans instability, although the simplest form of Jeans instability involving just self-gravity and pressure cannot occur, owing to galactic (sheared) rotation (see Section 2.2). If the background rotational shear is strong, as in the interarm regions of grand design spirals or in flocculent galaxies, there is no true instability but instead a process known as swing amplification (Goldreich & Lynden-Bell 1965, Toomre 1981); the dimensionless shear rate must be d ln Ω/d ln R ≲ −0.3 for swing amplification to occur (Kim & Ostriker 2001). If, however, the mean background dimensionless shear rate is low (as in the inner parts of galaxies where rotation is nearly solid-body, or as in spiral arms), another type of gravitational instability can develop provided magnetic fields are present to transfer angular momentum out of growing condensations (Elmegreen 1987, Kim & Ostriker 2001); this is referred to as a magneto-Jeans instability (MJI).',\n",
       "  'The characteristic azimuthal spatial scale for Parker instabilities is λϕ ≈ 4π H (Shu 1974). Growth rates are ∝ v\\nA/H, which tends to increase in spiral arms; thus these regions have traditionally been considered most favorable for growth of Parker modes (Mouschovias, Shu & Woodward 1974). Numerical simulations have shown, however, that Parker instability is not on its own able to create structures resembling GMCs, because the instability is self-limiting and saturates with only order-unity surface density enhancement (Kim et al. 1998; Santillán et al. 2000; Kim, Ryu & Jones 2001; Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2002). Spiral arms are also the most favorable regions for self-gravitating instabilities (Elmegreen 1994), because the characteristic (thin-disk) growth rate ∝ GΣgal/cs\\n is highest there. [Here, Σgal is the mean gas surface density averaged over large (greater than kpc) scales in the plane of the disk.] Because the spatial wavelengths of Parker and MJI modes are similar, in principle growth of the former could help trigger the latter within spiral arms (Elmegreen 1982a,b). In fact, it appears that turbulence excited in spiral shocks, together with vertical shear of the horizontal flow, may suppress growth of large-scale Parker modes in arm regions (Kim & Ostriker 2006). Thus, although the Parker instability is important in removing excess magnetic flux from the disk and in transporting cosmic rays (e.g., Hanasz & Lesch 2000), it may be of limited importance in the formation of GMCs.',\n",
       "  'Self-gravitating instabilities, unlike buoyancy instabilities, lead to ever-increasing density contrast if other processes do not intervene. The same is true for the swing amplifier if the (finite) growth is sufficient to precipitate gravitational runaway. The notion that there should be a threshold for star formation depending on the Toomre parameter,',\n",
       "  'is based on the idea that star-forming clouds can form by large-scale self-gravitating collective effects only if Q is sufficiently low. Here κ2 ≡ R\\n−3 ∥ (Ω2\\nR\\n4)/∥ R is the squared epicyclic frequency, and cs\\n is the mean sound speed of the gas. Numerical simulations have been used to determine the nonlinear instability criterion, finding that gravitationally bound clouds form provided Q < Q\\ncrit ≈ 1.5 in model disks that allow for realistic vertical thickness, turbulent magnetic fields, and a live stellar component (Kim, Ostriker & Stone 2003; Li, Mac Low & Klessen 2005b; Kim & Ostriker 2007; these models do not include global spiral structure in the gas imposed by variations in the stellar gravitational potential—see below.) These results agree with empirical findings for the mean value of Q at the star-formation threshold radii in nearby galaxies (e.g., Quirk 1972, Kennicutt 1989, Martin & Kennicutt 2001).',\n",

       "  'Observations of external galaxies with prominent spiral structure show that most of the molecular gas is concentrated in the spiral arms (e.g., Helfer et al. 2003, Engargiola et al. 2003), and within the Milky Way the most massive clouds that contain most of the mass and forming stars are strongly associated with spiral arms (Solomon, Sanders & Rivolo 1985; Solomon & Rivolo 1989; Heyer & Terebey 1998; Stark & Lee 2006). The observed relationship between GMCs and spiral structure suggests that molecular clouds are preferentially born in the high density gas that makes up the arms; this is consistent with theoretical expectations because growth rates for all proposed mechanisms increase with the gas surface density. As noted above, collisional coagulation is expected to be too slow in spiral arms; gravitational instabilities are, however, faster (e.g., Elmegreen 1990). Taking the ratio of the collision rate t\\ncollis\\n−1 to the characteristic growth rate of the MJI, π GΣgal/cs\\n, and setting σ = cs\\n and H ≈ cs\\n\\n2/(π GΣgal) (because gas gravity dominates stellar gravity in the arm), the result is \\n\\n. Thus, the collision rate is lower than the self-gravity contraction rate by roughly the surface filling factor of clouds in the arm, ∼0.2 − 0.5 if the arm surface density is enhanced by a factor of 3–6 above the mean value.',\n",
       "  'To obtain realistic estimates of the masses and other properties of clouds formed via gravitational instabilities, it is necessary to include the effects of spiral structure in detailed numerical models. Diffuse gas entering a spiral arm will in general undergo a shock, significantly increasing the background density (e.g., Roberts 1969; Shu, Milione & Roberts 1973); gas self-gravity enhances the maximum compression factor and also tends to symmetrize the gas density profile across the arm (Lubow, Cowie & Balbus 1986). In addition to strong variations in the gas surface density, spiral structure induces corresponding local variations in the gas flow velocity (both compression and streaming). Because the Jeans length is not small compared to the scale of these variations, the background arm profile must be taken into account in studying growth of self-gravitating condensations (Balbus 1988). Kim & Ostriker (2002) performed 2D MHD simulations of this process, showing that bound condensations develop both within the spiral arms themselves and also downstream from the arms in trailing gaseous spurs. Based on 3D local MHD simulations (Kim & Ostriker 2006) and 2D thick disk global simulations (Shetty & Ostriker 2006), bound gas condensations formed in spiral arms (and arm spurs) have typical masses 1 − 3 × 107\\nM\\n⊙. This value is about 10 times the thin-disk 2D Jeans mass using the peak arm density in Equation 33, or comparable to the value of the thick disk Jeans mass M\\n\\nJ\\n thick = 2π cs\\n\\n2\\nH/G, which is obtained using the gravitational kernel Φ\\nk\\n = −2π GΣ\\nk\\n/(k + k\\n2\\nH).',\n",
       "  'The masses of the bound structures formed via self-gravitating instabilities are comparable to the upper end of the mass function of GMCs in the Milky Way (see Equation 25), allowing for HI envelopes; they are also comparable to the masses of GMAs that have been observed in external spiral galaxies (e.g., Vogel, Kulkarni & Scoville 1988; Aalto et al. 1999; Rand, Lord & Higdon 1999). In addition, the morphology and spacing of spiral-arm spurs predicted to form via self-gravity effects are consistent with structures that have been observed at a variety of wavelengths (e.g., Elmegreen 1980; La Vigne, Vogel & Ostriker 2006). This spacing (of several times the Jeans length in the arm, cs\\n\\n2/[GΣgal, arm]) is similar to that of giant HII regions arranged as “beads on a string” along spiral arms in many grand design spirals (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1983), and also similar to the spacings of giant IR clumps observed with Spitzer along the spiral arms of interacting galaxies IC 2163 and NGC 2207 (Elmegreen et al. 2006). These giant IR clumps typically host a number of individual (optically observed) HII regions associated with star clusters. Although current millimeter-wavelength observations have insufficient resolution to identify subcondensations within GMAs in external galaxies, it is expected that their internal turbulence would create density substructure, just as the internal turbulence of GMCs fragments them into clumps. Because the mean density within GMCs is comparable to the typical density of cold clouds in the atomic medium, the pre-existing cloudy structure of the diffuse ISM would contribute to, but not dominate, the internal structure within GMCs. In this top-down picture, the more massive, self-gravitating, substructures within GMAs (or analogous atomic superclouds) would then become gravitationally bound GMCs.',\n",
       "  'Although large-scale self-gravitating instabilities appear necessary for forming massive GMCs, and many low-mass GMCs may form via fragmentation of massive GMCs or GMAs, it remains possible that a proportion of the low-mass GMCs form through other mechanisms. Several recent studies have explored the possibility of GMC assembly via colliding supersonic flows (e.g., Chernin, Efremov & Voinovich 1995; Vázquez-Semadeni, Passot & Pouquet 1995; Ballesteros-Paredes et al. 1999; Heitsch et al. 2005; Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2007); in this scenario the postshock gas in the stagnation region (which in fact becomes turbulent) represents the nascent GMC. For diffuse ISM gas at mean density \\n\\n with relative (converging) velocity v\\nrel, a total column of shocked gas Σcl builds up over time',\n",
       "  'note that modulo order-unity coefficients this time are the same as the result in Equation 31, with the velocity dispersion of the cloud distribution replaced by the relative velocity of the converging flow. Correlated flows can only be maintained up to the flow timescale over the largest spatial scale of the turbulence, ∼2H ∼ 300 pc. With v\\nrel equal to the RMS relative velocity \\n\\n for a Gaussian with 1D velocity dispersion σ ≈ 7 km s−1, this is ≈ 2 × 107 years, yielding a column ≈1021 cm−2 for \\n\\n (note that the shock velocity is about v\\nrel/2). If the interstellar magnetic field does not limit the compression of the shocked gas (an artificial assumption, requiring flow along field lines only), the postshock gas would have high enough density for significant amounts of H2 to form within the overall accumulation time, and the shielding from the diffuse UV is sufficient for CO to begin to form (Hartmann, Ballesteros-Paredes & Bergin 2001; Bergin et al. 2004). However, it should be noted that for a shock velocity of 10 km s−1, corresponding to a relative velocity of 20 km s−1, less than half the C is in CO after 108 years according to the 1D calculations of Bergin et al. (2004). Turbulence-induced clumping can accelerate molecule formation rates (Elmegreen 2000, Glover & Mac Low 2007), alleviating the timescale problem. The molecule formation rate is proportional to the mass-weighted mean density 〈n〉\\nM\\n, which is larger than the volume-weighted mean density \\n\\n in a turbulent flow (see Section 2.1.4). Because \\n\\n for typical turbulence levels in GMCs, this reduces the typical molecule formation time (Tielens 2005), \\n\\n, to 1–2 Myr. Even so, the discussion above shows that the maximum column density produced in the colliding-flow scenario is ∼1021 cm−2, which is lower by an order of magnitude than the mean value of the column of molecular gas in Milky Way GMCs; thus, this process can account for at most a small fraction of the molecular gas mass in GMCs. Because gravitational instabilities are suppressed by the high Q values in interarm regions, however, the turbulent accumulation mechanism may be more important there. Potentially, this may account for the observed difference (see above) between arm and interarm GMC masses in the Milky Way, as well as for the very low surface densities Σcl observed for many of the outer-Galaxy molecular clouds (Heyer, Carpenter & Snell 2001).',\n",
       "  'Finally, we note that the dynamical considerations for gravitationally bound cloud formation apply whether the diffuse gas is primarily atomic, as is the case in the Solar Neighborhood and the outer portions of galaxies more generally, or whether the diffuse gas is primarily molecular, as is true in the inner portions of many galaxies. The time- and length scales involved depend on the effective pressure in the diffuse gas, which includes thermal as well as turbulent and magnetic terms. If the diffuse gas is primarily molecular (or cold atomic) by mass, then the mean turbulent and Alfvén speeds will exceed the thermal speed in the dense gas. The thermal sound speed cs\\n in Equations 32 and 33 must then be replaced by an appropriately defined c\\neff that incorporates the effects of turbulent kinetic and magnetic pressures (the form of c\\neff would depend on the detailed multiphase structure of the gas). Similarly, the characteristic timescale for self-gravitating cloud formation becomes',\n",
       "  'Turbulent velocity dispersions and magnetic field strengths are observed to be similar in the cold and warm diffuse gas in the Solar Neighborhood (Heiles & Troland 2003, 2005), and both observations and simulations (Piontek & Ostriker 2005) show that magnetic pressure is generally a factor of two larger than the thermal pressure.',\n",

This transition occurs due to a combination of increased self-shielding (hence a lower H2 dissociation rate) as Σgal increases, and increased density (hence increased H2 formation rate) as both Σgal and the stellar surface density increase toward the center of a galaxy (Elmegreen 1993a, Blitz & Rosolowsky 2004).',\n",
       "  'GMCs are born in spiral arms downstream from the large-scale shock fronts and begin life in a very turbulent state. As they contract under the influence of gravity, this turbulence decays, although the rate of decay is slowed by compression. Mestel & Spitzer (1956) conjectured that turbulence would decay in about a crossing time, and for that reason rejected turbulence as a mechanism for supporting clouds against gravitational collapse (see also Mouschovias, Tassis & Kunz 2006, who argue for magnetic support). Indeed, in simulations that do not include energy injection, the contraction eventually evolves into free-fall collapse (cf. Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2007, who simulated the formation of molecular clouds in colliding flows, as discussed above), which is generally not observed. Furthermore, as discussed in Section 3.1, turbulence in molecular clouds is observed to be ubiquitous, suggesting that there is some mechanism acting to inject turbulent energy into clouds. How important is energy injection to the structure and evolution of molecular clouds?',\n",
       "  'Broadly speaking, there are two modes of energy injection, external and internal. External mechanisms tap the turbulence in the diffuse ISM, and because these modes are large scale, external driving would tend to yield a power spectrum that rises all the way to the largest scale in the GMC (see Section 2.1.1). In terms of total amplitudes, however, external driving may have limited practical importance. For example, though cloud-cloud collisions could drive turbulence, they may be too rare to be important (except possibly within the denser portions of spiral arms; see above). Magnetorotational instability (MRI) in the Galactic disk (Sellwood & Balbus 1999) connects GMCs to the diffuse ISM by threaded field lines and could therefore help drive GMC turbulence, but it is difficult for this to be effective because GMCs live for only a small fraction of a rotation period (see below), and because MRI is modest compared to other kinetic turbulence drivers in inner galaxies (Piontek & Ostriker 2005). Supernovae are the dominant energy source in most of the diffuse ISM (Mac Low & Klessen 2004), with instabilities in spiral shocks making a significant contribution in spiral arm regions (Kim, Kim & Ostriker 2006). It is difficult, however, for these (or other) processes to transmit energy from the diffuse ISM into molecular clouds, which are much denser (Yorke et al. 1989). In fact, the density contrast between molecular clouds and the ambient medium means that energy tends to be reflected from clouds rather than being transmitted into them [e.g., Elmegreen (1999) and Heitsch & Burkert (2002) showed this for externally generated Alfvén waves]. Thus, external energy is primarily limited to the turbulence GMCs inherit from their formation stages.',\n",
       "  'Internal energy injection is caused by feedback from protostars and newly formed stars. This mechanism is observed to be important, but it remains to be shown that it can account for the ubiquity of turbulence given that star formation is intermittent in both space and time. For example, Mooney & Solomon (1988) find that one-fourth of a sample of inner-Galaxy GMCs show no evidence for the presence of O stars. Norman & Silk (1980) were the first to analyze the importance of energy injection by stellar outflows. At the time of their work, bipolar outflows from protostars were unknown, and they focused on winds from TTSs. They suggested that these winds would blow cavities that would govern the structure of the clouds. Franco (1983) and Franco & Cox (1983) considered rotationally driven winds from protostars as well as T Tauri winds. They estimated the SFR required to keep swept-up shells colliding at a rate high enough to keep the cloud turbulent, and showed that this was roughly consistent with estimates of the Galactic SFR. The effect of stellar energy injection on the surrounding molecular cloud can be described in terms of an energy equation for the cloud (McKee 1989, 1999; Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006), \\n\\n where e is the energy per unit mass (including gravitational energy) and \\n\\n and \\n\\n represent energy gains and losses, respectively. The injection of energy into a cloud by stars is often accompanied by mass loss from the cloud. Under the simplifying assumption that mass lost from the cloud does not change the energy per unit mass, the specific energy losses are due to the decay of MHD turbulence, which occurs at a rate (see Section 2.1.2)',\n",
       "  'For a cloud of fixed size, the largest driving scale is λ ≃ 2R; for a cloud undergoing global expansion and contraction, the largest scale is λ ≃ 4R. Next, consider the energy gains. Because the shocks associated with the energy injection are radiative, most of the energy injected by outflows is radiated away. The outflow energy available to drive turbulence in the cloud is about \\n\\n, where pw\\n = mw vw\\n is the momentum, mw\\n the mass, and vw\\n the velocity of the (proto)stellar outflow; as a result, \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is the SFR and M is the cloud (or clump) mass. Balancing the energy gains and losses, \\n\\n, then gives the SFR necessary to maintain the turbulent motions.

Li & Nakamura (2006) and Nakamura & Li (2007) have carried out 3D MHD simulations of a forming star cluster and found that the rate at which energy is input from protostellar winds maintains the surrounding gas in approximate virial equilibrium. Matzner (2007) has given a general discussion of turbulence driven by protostellar outflows. In particular, he has shown on the basis of dimensional analysis that if outflows occur at a rate per unit volume \\n\\n and inject an average momentum \\n\\n into a medium of density ρ0, then on scales small compared to that at which the outflows overlap, the linewidth-size relation is \\n\\n, where the coefficient is of order unity.',\n",

However, some recent observations are in striking disagreement with these estimates: Based on observations of CO outflows by Bontemps et al. (1996), Walawender, Bally & Reipurth (2005) infer a much lower average outflow momentum pw\\n = 1.2 M\\n⊙ km s−1 (it should be noted, however, that they infer a much larger momentum, pw\\n = 18 M\\n⊙ km s−1, in a protostellar jet). Quillen et al. (2005) discovered a number of CO cavities in NGC 1333, which they identified as fossil outflows with pw\\n ∼ 1 M\\n⊙ km s−1; this estimate of the momentum has been confirmed in numerical simulations of fossil outflows (Cunningham et al. 2006). Like Walawender, Bally & Reipurth, they concluded that these outflows could support a region of active star formation like NGC 1333 against gravity, but outflows could not support the larger Perseus cloud in which it is embedded. Clearly, more observational work is needed to determine the rate of protostellar energy injection.',\n",
       "  'The theoretical caveat is that protostellar outflows are unlikely to be effective on the scale of GMCs. Turbulent driving yields a flat power spectrum at scales larger than the input scale of turbulence, regardless of magnetization (see Section 2.1.1). Because the scale of protostellar jets and outflows is small compared to that of a GMC, driving by low-mass stars is inconsistent with observed turbulence spectra that continue rising up to scales of tens of parsecs (see Section 2.1.5); this effect is partly ameliorated by the clustering of stars, because protostellar outflows from a cluster will extend to larger scales than those from individual stars. Protostellar outflows remain a viable energy source for clumps and cores within GMCs, however.',\n",
       "  'Massive stars can inject more momentum into GMCs through HII regions than do the much more numerous low-mass stars through their outflows (Matzner 2002); in addition, HII regions can inject energy on the scale of the GMC (\\nFigure 2\\n), overcoming the limitation of protostellar outflows in this regard. The dominant destruction mechanism for GMCs is via photoevaporation by blister HII regions (see below). The momentum given to a GMC by the loss of a mass δ M in a blister HII region is about 2c\\nII δ M, where c\\nII ≃ 10 km s−1 is the sound speed in the HII region (the factor 2 represents the sum of the thermal and ram pressures in a blister HII region). If the overall star-formation efficiency is εGMC, then a cloud of initial mass M will form a mass of stars εGMC\\nM and will lose a mass (1 − εGMC)M via photoevaporation.

       "  'The same HII regions that inject energy to support GMCs also destroy them. Blitz & Shu (1980) estimated that HII regions would inject enough energy to unbind a GMC in about 107 years. Using a simple analytic model for the evolution of blister HII regions developed by Whitworth (1979) and confirmed in numerical simulations by Yorke et al. (1989), Williams & McKee (1997) concluded that an expanding HII region would sweep up more mass than it ionized, so that a very large HII region would disrupt the cloud before ionizing it. The condition for cloud disruption—that the cloud be engulfed by the HII region—is difficult to meet for massive GMCs (≳106\\nM\\n⊙), but relatively common for small GMCs. Indeed, the Orion molecular cloud may well have been disrupted by previous generations of star formation. If one assumes that the specific SFR is independent of GMC mass, then the observed rate of star formation in the Galaxy implies that GMCs with masses ∼106\\nM\\n⊙ live for about 30 Myr. Matzner (2002) assumed that the SFR in a cloud is self-regulating and found that the specific SFR increases with cloud mass; as a result, he obtained smaller lifetimes for large GMCs, ∼20 Myr. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) obtained a similar value with a more complete model for GMC evolution (see below).',\n",
       "  'Observational estimates of GMC lifetimes are difficult, although chemical clocks can be used to measure the lifetime of clumps and cores within them (see Section 3.1.2). For the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, Blitz et al. (2007) discuss empirical measures of GMC lifetimes based on their spatial correlation with HII regions and young clusters and associations. About 25% of the GMCs show no evidence for high-mass star formation. This can be interpreted as a delay in the onset of star formation due either to the effects of magnetic fields (McKee 1989, Tassis & Mouschovias 2004), or to the time required to create cluster-forming clumps in a turbulent cloud (from simulations this time is ∼1 − 3t\\nff; e.g., Heitsch, Mac Low & Klessen 2001; Ostriker, Stone & Gammie 2001; Krasnopolsky & Gammie 2005; Vázquez-Semadeni et al. 2005); alternatively, if the SFR undergoes significant fluctuations (e.g., Krumholz, Matzner & McKee 2006), it could simply represent a lull in the SFR. In the LMC, about 60% of star clusters with ages <10 Myr are within 40 pc of a GMC, whereas older clusters have no significant spatial correlation with GMCs; Blitz et al. (2007) therefore infer that GMCs are destroyed within about 6 Myr of cluster formation. There are also slightly more than twice as many clouds harboring small HII regions as those containing large HII regions and clusters; they infer a lifetime of 14 Myr for this stage. These statistics imply that the typical time interval between when an HII region turns on and when the cloud is destroyed is ∼20 Myr. Including the GMCs without high-mass stars, they infer a total GMC lifetime of 27 Myr. There are several caveats to this analysis, however. First, the GMCs are identified only by their CO emission; because CO is more readily destroyed in the low-metallicity environment of the LMC than in the Galaxy (van Dishoeck & Black 1988), some GMCs could have been missed, both in the early stages of evolution when the density is low and in the late stage when the UV flux is high. Second, the mean mass of the clouds increases in going from the starless sample and the small-HII sample to the cluster sample; in fact, the two largest clouds are in the cluster sample, and overall just 10–15% of massive (M > 105.5\\nM\\n⊙) GMCs in the LMC and M33 lack (high-mass) star formation. The naive interpretation of this secular trend is that massive GMCs (which contain most of the molecular mass) have a more rapid onset of star formation than do low-mass clouds, although this is not a unique explanation. Next, the associations are unbound and dissolve rapidly; clusters dissolve more slowly, but one still cannot assume that their relative numbers accurately track the relative lifetimes. It is not clear how these latter two issues affect the analysis. Finally, large associations could displace the clouds by the rocket effect rather than destroy them (a process termed cloud shuffling by Elmegreen 1979). Nonetheless, observations of extragalactic GMCs offer the most promising avenue for getting an observational handle on GMC evolution.',\n",
       "  'How do GMCs and the star-forming clumps within them evolve in the presence of stellar and protostellar feedback? In the quasi-static approximation, a molecular cloud will be in approximate virial equilibrium. Under the additional assumption that the rate-limiting step in star formation is ambipolar diffusion, McKee (1989) found that GMCs contract under the influence of their self-gravity until the contraction is halted by stellar feedback; the equilibrium is stable and the column density is AV\\n ≃ 4 − 8 mag, comparable to the observed value. Dropping the assumption of quasi-static evolution and using the time-dependent virial theorem for a spherical, homologous cloud, Matzner & McKee (1999) found that a star-forming clump undergoes several bursts of star formation. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) extended this work by using a theory for the SFR that is consistent with the Kennicutt-Schmidt law (Krumholz & McKee 2005—see Section 3.4) and the full time-dependent virial and energy equations to solve for the evolution of GMCs that are large enough (≳ 105\\nM\\n⊙) that HII regions dominate the energy injection (Matzner 2002). Their time-dependent integrations assume spherical, homologous evolution for each GMC, and follow the formation and dynamical effects of many individual HII regions, with stars selected from the IMF. Blister HII regions act to destroy the clouds, but they also provide a confining pressure owing to the recoil associated with the mass loss. The prinicipal results of the time-dependent models are (a) clouds live for a few crossing times, ∼30 Myr for clouds with M ≳ 106\\nM\\n⊙, in agreement with observational estimates; (b) clouds are close to equilibrium, with virial parameters αvir ≃ 1 − 2; (c) the column density of the clouds is N\\nH ≃ 1022 cm−2, in agreement with observations; (d) large clouds are destroyed by photoevaporation, but small clouds (M ≲ 2 × 105\\nM\\n⊙) are disrupted before half their mass is photoionized; and (e) GMCs convert ∼5 − 10% of their mass into stars before they are destroyed. HII regions are unable to support GMCs with columns significantly greater than 1022 cm−2. Krumholz, Matzner & McKee (2006) conjecture that such clouds can occur in regions in which the mean density is not much less than the density in the GMCs, so that external driving is more efficient; such conditions could occur in starbursts. Testing and extension of these cloud evolution/destruction models via full 3D numerical simulations has not yet been attempted, but development and verification of the necessary computational codes is well underway (Krumholz, Stone & Gardiner 2007, submitted; Mac Low et al. 2007, submitted; Mellema et al. 2006).',\n",
       "  'How is the distribution of stellar masses, or IMF, established? This is one of most basic questions a complete theory of star formation must answer, but also one of the most difficult. Current evidence suggests that the IMF is quite similar in many different locations throughout the Milky Way, with the possible exception of star clusters formed very near the Galactic Center (Scalo 1998b presents evidence for significant variations in the IMF, but Elmegreen 1999 argues that much, if not all, of this is consistent with the expected statistical variations). The standard IMF of Kroupa (2001) is a three-part power-law with breaks at 0.08 M\\n⊙ and 0.5 M\\n⊙; i.e., \\n\\n with α = 1.3 for 0.5 < m\\n\\\\*/M\\n⊙ < 50, α = 0.3 for 0.08 < m\\n\\\\*/M\\n⊙ < 0.5, and α = −0.7 for 0.01 < m\\n\\\\*/M\\n⊙ < 0.08. The slope of the IMF at m\\n\\\\* ≳ M\\n⊙ was originally identified by Salpeter (1955), who found α = 1.35. Up to ∼ 1 M\\n⊙, a log-normal functional form \\n\\n provides a smooth fit for the observed mass distribution (Miller & Scalo 1979), with Chabrier (2005) finding that mc\\n ≈ 0.2 M\\n⊙ and σ ≈ 0.55 apply both for individual stars in the disk and in young clusters; the system IMF (i.e., counting binaries as single systems) has mc\\n = 0.25 M\\n⊙. Thus, the main properties of the IMF that any theory must explain are (a) the Salpeter power-law slope at high mass, (b) the break and turnover slightly below ∼1 M\\n⊙, (c) the upper limit on stellar masses ∼150 M\\n⊙ (Elmegreen 2000, Figer 2005, Oey & Clarke 2005), and (d) the universality of these features over a wide range of star-forming environments, apparently independent of the mean density, turbulence level, magnetic field strength, and to large extent also metallicity. Theory predicts that there should be a lower limit on (sub)stellar masses (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976), but this has not been confirmed observationally.',\n",
       "  'Important additional information has been provided by recent millimeter and submillimeter continuum surveys covering both cluster regions and larger areas in star-forming systems (e.g., Motte, André & Neri 1998; Testi & Sargent 1998; Johnstone et al. 2000, 2001; Motte et al. 2001; Beuther & Schilke 2004; Reid & Wilson 2005, 2006a; Stanke et al. 2006; Enoch et al. 2006; Nutter & Ward-Thompson 2007). Within continuum maps, high-density concentrations representing (starless) cores have been identified in sufficient numbers (and with sufficent resolution) that core mass functions (CMFs) analogous to the IMF can be defined. Similar CMFs may be derived using extinction data from well-sampled maps (Lada, Alves & Lombardi 2007) and molecular line maps in high-density tracers (Onishi et al. 2002). Studies of the CMF using extinction maps are only just beginning, but they promise to be very important given the lower systematic errors that are possible with this method. An excellent recent summary of the statistical properties of observed cores is given by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007).',\n",
       "  'The CMFs derived from many independent studies and methods are in good agreement with each other, and are remarkably similar in functional form to the stellar IMF. In particular, regardless of the total mass and size of the star-forming cloud, and regardless of whether cores are well separated or highly clustered, the high-end CMF (above 1 M\\n⊙) is consistent with a power-law. Applying a uniform analysis to data from 11 high- and low-mass star-forming regions, Reid & Wilson (2006b) find α = 0.8 − 2.1, with the mean value α = 1.4. Observed CMFs for relatively nearby clouds in the references cited above also show a peak and turnover at low mass in the range of ∼0.2 − 1 M\\n⊙. For distant clouds, the peak core mass is larger, but lack of resolution and hence low-mass incompleteness affects these results. Observed well-resolved CMF distributions are thus very similar to the stellar IMF, but shifted to higher mass by a factor of a few. For CMFs derived from millimeter and submillimeter observations, this factor involves some uncertainty associated with conversion from dust emissivity to total mass. The CMF derived from extinction in the Pipe nebula, which is not subject to this uncertainty, is shifted to higher masses by a factor of three with respect to the standard stellar IMF (Alves, Lombardi & Lada 2007).',\n",
       "  'The mirroring of the universal IMF by the (possibly also universal) CMF suggests that the stellar mass distribution is imposed early in the star-forming process. The final mass of a star appears to be controlled by the available reservoir of the core from which it forms, rather than, for example, being defined by a termination of accretion owing to internal stellar processes. The shift of the observed CMF relative to the IMF nevertheless implies that stellar feedback and other processes in the collapse or postcollapse stage affect stellar masses. Magnetized protostellar disk winds are believed to reduce the stellar mass compared to core mass by a factor of a few (see discussion in Section 4.2.6). In particular, Matzner & McKee (2000) predicted that the efficiency of a single star-formation event in an individual core is εcore ≈ 0.25 − 0.7, depending on the degree of flattening, which is comparable to the values implied by the observations cited above. Because the efficiency is not sensitive to the parameters involved, this implies a similar shift from CMF to IMF at all masses. Given the uncertainty in the CMF normalization, the inefficiency of single star formation may account for essentially the whole CMF→IMF shift. Some further fragmentation of presently observed massive cores during their collapse may also occur, but provided that the majority of the mass goes into a single object, this will leave the high-mass end of the CMF relatively unchanged. Because the CMF is already dominated by low-mass cores (by mass as well as by number), the addition of low-mass stars formed as fragments from collapsing high-mass cores would negligibly affect the low-mass end of the IMF.',\n",
       "  'Molecular line observations of low-mass cores, whether found in isolation (as in Taurus) or in close proximity to other cores in a dense, cluster-forming clump (as in ρ Oph), show that these cores have very low nonthermal internal velocities (André et al. 2007). Because weak internal turbulence implies that little density substructure is present within these cores, they are unlikely to undergo subsequent fragmentation during collapse, except to form binaries. The low-mass portion of the CMF should therefore be conserved in mapping to the IMF, modulo mass removal by outflows. Although cores in the high-mass end of the CMF are turbulent and thus, in principle, subject to further fragmentation, the agreement between the CMF and IMF suggests that this is not a dominant effect.',\n",
       "  \"The environments of observed prestellar cores provide further clues to the processes involved in their formation. Most stars form in clusters (Lada & Lada 2003; see Section 4.3.5), and correspondingly, most (starless) molecular cores are part of larger cluster-forming dense clumps. These cluster-forming clumps [referred to as cluster-forming cores by Ward-Thompson et al. (2007)], as observed for example in Ophiuchus, Serpens, Perseus, and Orion, have supersonic internal turbulent linewidths (even though the individual cores within them are subthermal). Compared to isolated cores, the cores in clusters tend to be more compact in overall size and have higher densities and column densities; they are also lower in mass (Ward-Thompson et al. 2007). The column densities of cluster-forming clumps are generally quite large, and in particular they exceed the mean column densities of the GMCs in which they are formed. In Perseus, where 80% of the millimeter cores lie in groups and 50% are in clusters (Enoch et al. 2006), 50% of the total cloud mass is at AV\\n < 4 and 80% is at AV\\n < 6, whereas 90% of the mass in prestellar cores is in larger structures that have AV\\n > 6, and 50% is at AV\\n > 8 (Kirk, Johnstone & Di Francesco 2006). Similarly in Ophiuchus, the prestellar cores are found in high-column density regions (AV\\n > 15 for > 90% of the core mass), whereas most of the cloud's mass has much lower column densities (70% is at AV\\n < 7) (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004). The prestellar cores themselves represent only a tiny fraction of the total cloud mass: 5% in Perseus (Enoch et al. 2006), and 3% in Ophiuchus (Johnstone, Di Francesco & Kirk 2004); this is comparable to the net observed star-formation efficiency over the lifetime of a GMC (see Section 3.4). On the largest scales, GMCs generally consist of collections of filaments, and both the clusters of cores and most of the individual isolated cores are embedded in these filaments. The structure formation that produces cores, and eventually stars, is therefore clearly a hierarchical process.\",\n",
       "  'Many theories have been proposed that aim to explain the IMF or some aspect of it, and more recently to explain the CMF as well (see Elmegreen 2001 and Bonnell, Larson & Zinnecker 2007 for recent reviews). Although none of the proposals to date have won general acceptance, several have introduced elements that are likely to be important in the eventual theory that is developed. Numerical simulations have been valuable in demonstrating that the general characteristics of observed CMFs arise naturally in turbulent, self-gravitating flows, and they have also been useful in testing certain specific hypotheses. However, many features that are seen in the simulations are not yet understood in a fundamental sense, and limited numerical resolution may affect some existing results.',\n",

       "  \"In many simulations that include self-gravity, the high-end slope tends to become shallower over time, as massive objects grow larger. This change in slope may not represent realistic evolution, if massive condensations in fact should undergo fragmentation that the simulations do not follow. Failure to capture fragmentation during collapse could affect results from either grid-based or SPH simulations. Fragmentation is seeded by turbulence, which imposes fluctuations in the density (Sasao 1973). These fluctuations grow as a condensation collapses, and in principle could ultimately result in fragmentation if they become locally Jeans unstable (Hunter 1962, Lynden-Bell 1973). Fluctuations at smaller and smaller mass scales would grow to be highly nonlinear if collapse were to proceed unchecked, so in order to capture this numerically, turbulence at scales below the sonic scale would have to be resolved before collapse commences in a given region. However, it is likely that in reality fragmentation of collapsing high mass condensations is prevented by real physical effects, rather than numerical effects: accretion onto stars formed early in the collapse process heats the surrounding gas significantly, which helps limit further fragmentation (Krumholz 2006), and for condensations in cluster-forming regions, outflows from nearby stars inject small-scale turbulence that may provide support sufficient to prevent rapid localized collapse (Tan, Krumholz & McKee 2006; Nakamura & Li 2007; see also Klessen 2001). Until physical processes enter to limit further breakup of massive condensations during their evolution, self-similarity implies they would fragment owing to the same turbulent processes that produced the massive condensations in the first place. This is presumably why the IMF in clusters is the same as that in distributed star formation. Observed dense clumps break up into individual small cores when imaged at high resolution, suggesting that much of the fragmentation is in place prior to collapse. Indeed, the fact that the turnover of the IMF is similar to the Jeans or Bonner-Ebert mass evaluated at the mean turbulent kinetic pressure within GMCs (see Section 3.1.1), P\\nkin/k\\nB ∼ 3 × 105 K cm−3, suggests that the ambient pressure that sets the typical star's mass is not significantly increased above this level by collapse prior to fragmentation. However, note that the correspondence between the turnover in the IMF and the Bonnor-Ebert mass evaluated at the mean turbulent pressure appears to break down in star clusters like the Orion Nebula Cluster (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998) and globular clusters (Paresce & De Marchi 2000), which are believed to have formed at substantially greater pressures (McKee & Tan 2003); the reason for this is not clear.\",\n",
       "  'A common numerical shortcut to studying cluster formation is to focus on just a single cluster, rather than the whole hierarchical system; this allows the collapse and fragmentation to be better resolved. Models of this kind initiate a simulation at high density with comparable internal turbulent and gravitational energy. However, this approach misses an aspect of the real situation that may be quite important: Self-gravitating massive condensations develop out of nonself-gravitating gas in which pertubations have already been imposed by turbulence. In simulations where the initial kinetic energy does not exceed the gravitational energy, collapse occurs before the turbulence is able to imprint a realistic density structure on the system, such that the subsequent fragmentation may also be unrealistic. In particular, this may lead to massive fragments continuing to grow over time as they capture low-turbulence unstructured gas from their surroundings (competitive accretion; see Section 4.1.2). To obtain a reliable measure of the high-end CMF from numerical models, it will be necessary to perform simulations that include large scales as well as cluster scales, and adequately resolve massive condensations both prior to and during collapse. In addition, physical processes representing the feedback from star formation must be properly included in order to impose realistic limits on fragmentation, coalescence, and accretion after collapse begins.',\n",
       "  'Another feature of numerical simulations that is at least qualitatively in accord with observations is the presence of a resolved peak and turnover in the CMF. Exactly how the location of this peak depends on model parameters, however, is not yet well determined. In some simulations, the CMF peak is found to be at masses comparable to the initial Jeans mass of the system (these are primarily low-Mach-number simulations), whereas in other simulations the peak is at much lower mass (these are primarily at high Mach number). The turbulent power spectrum can also affect the position of the CMF peak, and in some simulations the peak is seen to move to larger mass over time. In fact, the position of the peak for an isothermal simulation with a fixed turbulence scaling law must be a function of two dimensionless parameters, the ratio of the total mass in the system to the initial Jeans mass, and the turbulent Mach number on the largest scale. For magnetized simulations, an additional parameter is the ratio of mass to the magnetic critical mass. Although limited dependence on parameters has been explored, a comprehensive and controlled study has not yet been performed. Note that the mass-weighted density in a turbulent system increases as the turbulent Mach number increases (see Section 2.1.4), so that the Jeans mass at the typical (mass-weighted) cloud density decreases as the turbulence level increases, for a given mean (volume-weighted) density and Jeans mass. This probably accounts for why the peak of the CMF was found to be far below the mean Jeans mass in studies with high \\n\\n, and close to the mean Jeans mass in studies with lower \\n\\n.',\n",
       "  \"A recurrent theme in star-formation theory is that the characteristic mass—defined by the peak of the IMF—is the Jeans mass at some preferred density. An upper limit on the preferred density, and hence a lower limit on the fragment mass, is the value at which which the optical depth is unity over a Jeans length; this yields a minimum fragment mass ≈0.007 M\\n⊙ (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976). More recently, Larson (2005) has argued that the thermal coupling of gas to dust at densities above n\\nH = nc\\n ≈ 106 cm−3 results in a shift from weakly decreasing to weakly increasing temperature as a function of density (T ∝ ρ-0.27 changes to T ∝ ρ0.07 at T\\nmin ∼ 5 K), and that the Jeans mass ∼0.3 M\\n⊙ at this inflection point sets the preferred mass scale in the IMF. Part of Larson's argument is that if structure is filamentary, then the filaments will contract radially while γ < 1; fragmentation into protostellar cores would occur when the filament's central density reaches nc\\n and γ exceeds unity. This argument does not take into account, however, that the mass per unit length of a filament may be determined primarily by the turbulence that originally creates it. In this case, the density nc\\n defines a Jeans length (see Equation 20 in Section 2.2), so that the mass scale that emerges would be set by this (fixed) length scale ∼λ\\nJ\\n (nc\\n) times the (variable) filament mass per unit length. The simulations of Jappsen et al. (2005), which vary the density nc\\n at which the temperature minimum occurs, provide qualitative support for Larson's proposal in that the peak of the CMF moves to lower mass as nc\\n increases. The scaling of peak mass with nc\\n in the simulations is not consistent with the predicted m\\npeak ∝ nc\\n\\n-0.95 scaling, however. In addition, these models did not test dependence on other parameters that may be important, such as the Mach number of the turbulence or the total mass of the system.\",\n",
       "  'A recent comprehensive proposal to explain the CMF and IMF has been advanced by Padoan & Nordlund (2002, 2004). They argue that because the strength of any given compression (in a shock) is related to its corresponding (preshock) spatial scale ℓ, a power-law turbulence spectrum |v(ℓ)| ∝ ℓ\\nq\\n will result in a distribution of clump masses that itself follows a power-law. In particular, they propose that the clump mass function produced by turbulence in a magnetized medium will obey \\n\\n. They further propose that at a given mass m, the fraction of clumps created by turbulence that collapse is obtained by integrating the density PDF down to the density at which that mass would be Jeans unstable, i.e., ρmin = π5 σth\\n6/(36m\\n2\\nG\\n3). With this prescription, at high mass the limit of the integral ρmin → 0 and they find α = 3/(3 − 2q) ≈ 1.4. The position of the CMF peak would depend on the properties of the density PDF; for a log-normal PDF (fM\\n; see Equation 5 in Section 2.1.4) with μ\\nx\\n = 0.5 − 2, the peak mass would be between 0.8 − 0.1 times the Jeans mass at the mean (volume-weighted) density in the cloud.',\n",
       "  \"The proposal of Padoan & Nordlund is attractive in its overall thrust, and analysis of numerical simulations (Padoan et al. 2007) shows promising consistency with some of the model predictions, such as a steepening of the CMF (larger α) with steeper velocity power spectrum (larger q). The Padoan & Nordlund proposal, however, also suffers from missing links in its theoretical underpinnings: (a) The effective value of vA\\n is defined by Padoan & Nordlund such that the typical compression ρ′/ρ in a shock moving at v is a factor v/vA\\n (in fact, compression factors depend on the magnetic field direction as well as strength). This effective vA\\n is assumed to be independent of scale, and for numerical comparisons with data they adopt a value small compared to the typical value in a GMC of ∼2 km s−1. (b) The argument used to obtain α = 3/(3 − 2q) for turbulence-induced clumps assumes that each preshock volume ℓ3 maps to a number of postshock volumes of mass m that is independent of ℓ; i.e., \\n\\n Although this is plausible, other arguments can be made that draw on the scale-free nature of turbulence, yet yield different results.

This scaling corresponds to converting a constant fraction of the mass or volume behind every shock into clumps, \\n\\n, where ℓ′ = ℓ v\\nA/v = ℓ ρ/ρ′ is the postshock scale. One might also propose that the filling factor of postshock clumps within the whole volume should be constant, i.e., \\n\\n. This leads to \\n\\n, or α = 0.75 for q = 1/2. Although the assumption \\n\\n in the Padoan & Nordlund formulation yields results that are in agreement with measured CMFs, a physical argument is needed to explain why this is the correct choice among several plausible alternatives. In particular, as Padoan & Nordlund's argument for the slope α = 3/(3 − 2q) involves only turbulence, why does this value of α disagree with the distinctly shallower empirical mass spectrum (αclump ∼ 0.5; see Section 3.1) of nonself-gravitating clumps in GMCs? (c) The argument Padoan & Nordlund use to obtain a formula for the mass function does not appear to take account of substructure within clumps at a given mass scale, although the presence of substructure is implicit in their picture. In particular, they assume that any region that is unstable by the thermal Jeans criterion will collapse. An implicit requirement for this is that at each density, a contiguous volume containing a mass in excess of the Jeans mass is present. More generally, because hierarchical density structures are clearly important in nature (most cores and stars are clustered), any fundamental theory should identify how this comes about. Given these difficulties, it appears premature to accept the Padoan & Nordlund proposal in its current form, although it is promising as a basis for future development.\",\n",
       "  'Much of this review focuses on the detailed physical processes of star formation at and below GMC scales. To understand the structure of a given galaxy, however, or the evolution of a population of galaxies over cosmological timescales, often only a very gross characterization of the star-formation processes—such as the overall SFR and the resulting IMF—is adequate. Many empirical studies of disk galaxies characterize the SFR in terms of the number of stars formed per unit time per unit area ˙ Σ\\\\*; this is usually reported using either averages over the whole of a galaxy within some outer radius R, or using azimuthal averages over an annulus of width dR to give ˙ Σ\\\\* (R). Both of these methods average over regions that may have widely varying SFRs, and the results must be carefully interpreted as strong nonlinearities are involved. Fortunately, with the data becoming available from large-scale galactic mapping surveys (e.g., SONG and SINGS; Helfer et al. 2003; Kennicutt et al. 2003), it will soon be possible to characterize SFRs on scales large compared to individual GMCs but small enough to separately measure, e.g., SFRs for arm and interarm regions.',\n",
       "  'More fundamental than ˙ Σ\\\\* is the star-formation or gas consumption timescale. This is defined by \\n\\n, where Σ\\ng\\n is the gas surface density; the second equality assumes that the same area average is used for the total gas mass Mg\\n and SFR M\\n\\\\*. The resulting timescale depends on the gas tracer(s) chosen, which determines the range of gas densities included in Σ\\ng\\n. For a chemical species tracing gas in a class of structures denoted by S that have mean internal gas density 〈ρ〉\\nV\\n = ρ\\nS\\n, and total mass MS\\n, a convenient fiducial time for comparison to \\n\\n is the free-fall time obtained by using ρS in Equation 14. The star-formation or gas consumption rate is then',\n",
       "  'where the efficiency over a free-fall time is \\n\\n (see Krumholz & McKee 2005 and Krumholz & Tan 2007; note that they denote this quantity by SFRff,S\\n). Note that the star-formation efficiency εff,S\\n over the free-fall time at the mean local density of structures S differs from the star-formation efficiency ε\\nS\\n over the mean lifetime of individual structures in class S, which is discussed below. The definition in Equation 38 is particularly useful for describing star formation on local scales within GMCs, in which different molecular transitions trace a relatively limited range of densities, and in which densities can be obtained for individual structures that are spatially resolved and have mass measurements from dust continuum or extinction observations. Because most of the molecular gas, and essentially all star formation, is found within GMCs, the SFR in a region with local surface density in GMCs, ΣGMC, is given by \\n\\n. Here, t\\nff,GMC is calculated using the free-fall time within GMCs in a given region. Typical mean densities within GMCs are nH\\n ∼ 100 cm−3, implying t\\nff,GMC ∼ 4 Myr, but this may vary owing to the effects of spiral arms, for example. In clumps or cores within GMCs, ρS can be larger by orders of magnitude compared to ρGMC, yielding a corresponding decrease in t\\nff.',\n",
       "  'The values of εff,S\\n are generally low (≲ 0.01) over a wide range of density tracers (see below), and vary only weakly with ρS. Krumholz & Tan (2006) point out that this suggests that turbulence is limiting star formation, although magnetic regulation is also possible (but probably not on GMC scales, because they appear to be magnetically supercritical—Section 2.3). In the turbulence-regulation picture, the low overall efficiency of star formation on GMC scales (over their own free-fall times) is dictated by the low fraction of gas that concentrates into structures that are sufficiently dense to collapse before being redispersed by turbulence. The weak variation of ϵff,S\\n with density follows naturally if the density obeys a log-normal distribution, which is consistent both with numerical simulations of supersonic turbulent flows and with observations of extinction statistics (Sections 2.1.4 and 2.1.5). For a log-normal distribution defined by Equation 5, let MS\\n be the mass with densities in the range δ xS\\n surrounding \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is obtained by dividing total GMC mass by total GMC volume. Then because the SFR M\\n\\\\* is independent of tracer,',\n",
       "  'where \\n\\n is the (mass-weighted) mean within a GMC. With μ\\nx\\n ∼ 1.5 [corresponding to mass-weighted mean density \\n\\n, typical of GMCs] and δ xS\\n ∼ 1, εff,S\\n/εff,GMC is between 1.4 and 3.4 for 1 < ρ\\nS\\n/〈ρ〉\\nM\\n < 10; larger values of μ\\nx\\n keep εff,S\\n ∼ εff,GMC over a larger range of densities. Approximate constancy of εff,S\\n over a range of densities implies the approximate relation \\nM\\n\\nS\\n ∝ t\\nff ∝ ρ\\nS\\n\\n-1/2\\n from Equation 38. Physically, this is because the equilibrium fraction of mass in a GMC in structures at densities significantly above \\n\\n is equal to the ratio of the destruction time to the formation time of those structures, t\\ndest,S\\n/t\\nform,S\\n. In a turbulent medium, the destruction time is of order the dynamical time of the structure, which decreases with increasing density and decreasing size, whereas the formation time is of order the dynamical time of the GMC for all structures, because the large-scale flow dominates. Note, however, that this discussion does not apply to regions in which self-gravity is strong but turbulence is weak, as occurs in low-mass prestellar cores. In such cores, εff rises by an order of magnitude or more to ∼0.1. Quiescent cores have individual lifetimes of a few t\\nff (see Section 3.1.2), and net efficiency of star formation in each core ∼1/3 owing to the action of protostellar winds (see Sections 3.3.1 and 4.2.6). These structures have evolved to have internal densities (and hence self-gravity) high enough that they can resist destruction by the ambient turbulence. In regions such as forming clusters, where self-gravity causes strong departures from the overall log-normal density distribution in GMCs and high gravity is offset by locally driven turbulence, the relation (Equation 39) would also not be expected to apply.',\n",
       "  'Even within a given density regime, there may be significant cloud-to-cloud variations in local conditions such that t\\n\\nS\\\\* need not be a universal quantity even for structures observed in a given tracer. Indeed, Mooney & Solomon (1988) showed that for Milky Way GMCs with virial masses (traced in CO) M\\nCO = 104 − 5 × 106\\nM\\n⊙ and IR luminosities \\n\\n, the ratio \\nt\\nGMC,\\\\* ∝ M\\nCO/L\\nIR\\n varies over two orders of magnitude and is not correlated with M\\nCO. Williams & McKee (1997) came to a similar conclusion from their analysis of OB associations and GMCs in the Galaxy. With a total GMC mass ≃ 109\\nM\\n⊙ in the Galaxy and a SFR of several M\\n⊙ year−1, the mean value of t\\nGMC,\\\\* ≈ 3 × 108 years, which translates to εff,GMC ∼ 0.01 if \\n\\n in GMCs. For dense gas clumps in GMCs, however, it appears that conditions are more uniform, such that there is less scatter in t\\n\\nS\\\\* for dense gas tracers. In particular, Wu et al. (2005) show that the ratio \\n\\n measured in Milky Way star-forming regions agrees with the same values measured in high-redshift galaxies (Gao & Solomon 2004), for which there is only one order of magnitude scatter. Wu et al. (2005) estimate a corresponding star-formation timescale of t\\nHCN,\\\\* = 8 × 107 years. If the typical density of HCN-emitting gas is ∼105 cm−3, the corresponding efficiency per free-fall time is εff,HCN ∼ 0.002. Krumholz & Tan (2007) apply slightly different factors to convert total HCN and IR luminosities to gas masses and SFRs, and obtain εff,HCN ∼ 0.006. These values of εff are small compared to those for individual cores (∼0.1), which in clustered regions (where most stars form) have densities ∼107 cm−3 (Ward-Thompson et al. 2007) that are large compared to the densities traced by HCN.',\n",
       "  'In spite of the large scatter in t\\n\\nS\\\\* from one local region to another (in various density tracers), empirical studies have shown that when averaged over large scales, t\\n\\ng\\\\* is correlated with the global properties of gas in a galaxy. The early studies of Schmidt (1959, 1963) sought to characterize the SFR as a power-law (with index >1) in the mean gas density (both volume and surface density); this would then translate to t\\n\\ng\\\\* (or t\\nff/εff) that varies as a negative power of gas density. More recently, following Kennicutt (1989), a number of empirical studies of disk galaxies have identified and explored Kennicutt-Schmidt laws of the form \\n\\n, for which \\nt\\n\\ng\\\\* ∝ Σ\\ng\\n\\n-p\\n. The original study by Kennicutt investigated correlations of \\n\\n (based on Hα) with the total Σ\\ng\\n (R) (including both atomic and molecular gas); he found an index p = 0.3 for Σ\\ng\\n (R) above a threshold level. Kennicutt (1998) studied correlations of global averages of \\n\\n with Σ\\ng\\n (again combining atomic and molecular gas). For the whole sample including normal galaxies, the centers of normal galaxies, and starbursts, the fitted index is p = 0.4; the index is slightly larger for just normal spirals. Recent years have seen a number of other studies of the \\n\\n relationship based on annular averages in galaxies, using Hα, radio continuum, or far-IR to measure star formation, and using either the total gas surface density or just the molecular gas contribution from CO observations (Murgia et al. 2002, Wong & Blitz 2002, Boissier et al. 2003, Heyer et al. 2004, Komugi et al. 2005, Schuster et al. 2007). Most of these studies have found p in the range 0.3 − 0.4, although larger values of p have been obtained in some analyses that include both atomic and molecular gas. For dense gas as traced by HCN, Gao & Solomon (2004) found a linear relationship between the integrated SFR and the total mass of dense gas, i.e., p = 0, based on a sample including both normal galaxies and luminous/ultraluminous IR galaxies. For the same sample, the fitted SFR-gas mass index is p = 0.7 for less dense molecular gas observed in CO lines. All of these fits involve (at least) an order of magnitude scatter about the mean relation. Taken together, these results imply that the amount of dense gas available for star formation increases nonlinearly with the global amount of lower-density gas, but that the SFR in this dense gas is independent of global galactic properties.',\n",
       "  'A second approach to characterizing global SFRs introduces the global timescale associated with the galaxy, the orbital period t\\norb = 2π/Ω. For grand design spirals, the SFR is expected to be proportional to the rate at which gas passes through spiral arms, because GMCs are expected (and observed) to form rapidly in the high-surface-density gas behind the spiral shock (e.g., Roberts 1969; Kim & Ostriker 2002, 2006; Shetty & Ostriker 2006). Shu (1973) appears to have been the first to propose this idea and showed that it is roughly consistent with observations of star formation in the Galaxy. Wyse (1986) proposed that GMCs, and hence stars, are the result of atomic cloud-cloud collisions at a rate ∝ Σ\\ng\\n\\n2 (Ω − Ω\\np\\n), where Ω\\np\\n is the pattern speed. More generally, Wyse & Silk (1989) suggested that the SFR should scale as \\n\\n. This has been confirmed by Kennicutt (1998); the resulting two forms for the Kennicutt-Schmidt law are',\n",
       "  'The fact that there are two forms of the star-formation law implies that there is a correlation between Σ\\ng\\n and Ω; Krumholz & McKee (2005) found Ω ∝ Σ\\ng\\n\\n0.49 for a sample comprised of both normal and starburst galaxies (Kennicutt 1998, Downes & Solomon 1998). The reason for this correlation is not known at present, but may be related to an overall tendency for velocity dispersions to increase at large surface densities (see below).

Thus, both the diffuse-dominated and GMC-dominated cases yield \\n\\n, assuming that the efficiency factors are comparable in different regions of a galaxy and from one galaxy to another.

GMC formation on a timescale ∼t\\n\\nJ,2D\\n, implying a SFR of \\n\\n if εGMC is weakly varying, also yields the other form of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law if the effective velocity dispersion increases with surface density according to c\\neff ∝ Σ\\ng\\n\\n1−p\\n. A significant increase in the gas velocity dispersion at small radii, where Σ\\ng\\n is generally larger, has been noted in several galaxies (Kenney, Carlstrom & Young 1993; Sakamoto 1996; Walsh et al. 2002; Lundgren et al. 2004; Schuster et al. 2007), although there is no quantitative theory for this increase.',\n",
       "  'A quantitative theory for the galactic SFR must determine the star-formation efficiency (e.g., εff,GMC or εGMC) as well as the corresponding overall rate. [An exception is the theory of Silk (1997), who notes that the porosity of hot gas in a galaxy is determined by the SFR; the SFR can thus be expressed in terms of the porosity, but this remains uncertain.] Tan (2000) proposed that the overall SFR is determined by cloud-cloud collisions, but he set the efficiency based on comparison with observations. Elmegreen (2002, 2003) suggested that the SFR per unit volume is \\n\\n, where f\\ncore is the fraction of gas in dense cores; the value of this was set by comparison with observation.

       "  \"A theory for the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time has been given by Krumholz & McKee (2005); for galaxies in which f\\nGMC ≃ 1, this is proposed as a complete theory of the Kennicutt-Schmidt law. The first three assumptions underlying the theory have been discussed above: They assume that star formation occurs primarily in GMCs, so that the SFR is described by Equation 41, that the density PDF in GMCs is log normal, as inferred from simulations of turbulence in gas that is approximately isothermal (Section 2.1.4), and that the IMF has the standard form. The final assumption is that low-mass stars form in all gas dense enough that the sonic length in the surrounding turbulent gas exceeds the Jeans length (λ\\nJ\\n < ℓ\\ns\\n) (Padoan 1995) with an efficiency εcore ∼ 1/2 from the theoretical estimate of Matzner & McKee (2000). The condition that λ\\nJ\\n < ℓ\\ns\\n ensures that critical Bonnor-Ebert spheres are not torn apart by turbulence; the corresponding critical density implies that the thermal pressure in the cores matches the turbulent pressure in the environment, \\n\\n. An important part of this last assumption is that the regions that are dense enough to satisfy λ\\nJ\\n < ℓ\\ns\\n have masses large enough to collapse. The normalization for the SFR is based on the simulations of Vázquez-Semadeni, Ballesteros-Paredes & Klessen (2003). These assumptions lead to a star-formation efficiency \\n\\n. Because the virial parameter in GMCs is of order unity and the Mach numbers are somewhat smaller than 100 in regions where they have been observed (and greater than a few 100 even in unresolved starbursts), this corresponds to a typical εff,GMC ∼ 0.02. For galaxies in which the gas is not fully molecular, Krumholz & McKee (2005) adopt the phenomenological result for f\\nGMC obtained by Blitz & Rosolowsky (2006). They show that the resulting SFR agrees well with Kennicutt's observed relations (Equation 40).\",\n",
       "  'Finally, we remark that controversy continues to surround the question of what physical process defines the observed outer-disk thresholds R\\nth for active star formation. Kennicutt (1989) and Martin & Kennicutt (2001) argue that disk thresholds are set by gravitational stability considerations in shearing, rotating disks, and find a mean value of Q ≈ 1.4 when they adopt a constant value c\\neff = 6 km s−1 for their sample. Numerical simulations of isothermal gas disks, including both disk thickness effects and the gravity from an active stellar disk, quantitatively support this conclusion (Li, Mac Low & Klessen 2005a; Kim & Ostriker 2007). However, Schaye (2004), building on the suggestion of Elmegreen & Parravano (1994), argues that star-formation thresholds are defined by the condition that the pressure is high enough that a cold component of the atomic ISM can exist. This transition point depends on the UV intensity and metallicity (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2003), but typically corresponds to threshold surface density ∼3 − 10 M\\n⊙ pc−2. Schaye essentially reverses the argument for a Q threshold: He argues that when a significant fraction of the ISM becomes cold, Q drops significantly and gravitational instability ensues. An advantage of this proposal is that it can naturally account for the isolated patches of star formation that occur outside R\\nth (Ferguson et al. 1998, Boissier et al. 2006), because star formation occurs wherever the pressure of gas exceeds the critical value. However, though the model gives a necessary condition for star formation, it does not give a sufficient condition: Some of the galaxies in the Martin & Kennicutt (2001) sample have R\\nth inside the radius at which the gas becomes molecular, which in turn is inside the radius at which cold atomic gas first appears (see also de Blok & Walter 2006, who find evidence of a cold atomic component even in nonstar-forming regions). In these cases, it is possible that MRI-driven turbulence in the outer disk maintains Q > 1 even when some of the gas is cold (Piontek & Ostriker 2007).',\n",
       "  'Star formation is traditionally divided into two parts: Low-mass stars form in a time short compared to the Kelvin-Helmholz time, t\\nKH = Gm\\n\\\\*\\n2/RL, whereas high-mass stars form in a time ≳ t\\nKH (Kahn 1974). This distinction between low-mass and high-mass protostars is not fully satisfactory, however, because for a sufficiently high accretion rate any protostar would be classified as low-mass. We somewhat arbitrarily divide low- and high-mass stars at a mass of 8 M\\n⊙. Protostars that will form stars with masses significantly below this value have luminosities dominated by accretion, and they form from cores that have masses on the order of the thermal Jeans mass. Protostars above this mass have luminosities that are dominated by nuclear burning unless the accretion rate is very high, and if they form from molecular cores, those cores are significantly above the thermal Jeans mass. Low-mass stars undergo extensive premain-sequence evolution in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, from the point on the birthline, where they cease accreting and are revealed (Stahler 1983; see also Larson 1972), to the main sequence. Here we briefly review the current understanding of how such stars form.',\n",
       "  'As discussed above, low-mass stars appear to form from gravitationally bound cores. The timescale for the collapse of these cores determines both the timescale for the formation of a star and the accretion luminosity. Note that the rate of infall onto the star-disk system, \\n\\n, can differ from the rate of accretion onto the protostar, M\\n\\\\*, because some of the infalling gas can be temporarily stored in the disk. The collapse of such cores and the growth of the resulting protostars has been reviewed by Larson (2003), and we draw on this work here. At the outset of theoretical studies of star formation, it was realized that isothermal cores undergoing gravitational collapse become very centrally concentrated, with a density profile that becomes approximately ρ ∝ r\\n−2 (Bodenheimer & Sweigart 1968, Larson 1969). Prior to the formation of the protostar, there is a central, thermally supported region of size r ≃ λ\\nJ\\n. Collapse of a marginally unstable core begins near the outer radius. The r\\n−2 density gradient is created as the wave of collapse propagates inward, leaving every scale marginally unstable as the collapse accelerates (cf. Larson 2003). That is, because λ\\nJ\\n ∼ cs\\n/(Gρ)1/2 (Equation 20), a sphere that is marginally unstable at each scale, r ∼ λ\\nJ\\n, will have ρ ∼ cs\\n\\n2/(Gr\\n2) when the protostar is first formed; the corresponding infall rate is',\n",
       "  'where the gravitational mass and radius are defined in Equation 13 and ϕin is a numerical factor that is typically ≳ 1. (When the effect of protostellar outflows is included, the infall rate is reduced by a factor εcore < 1.) Although this result was first derived for an isothermal sphere, Stahler, Shu & Taam (1980) emphasize that it should apply approximately to the collapse of any cloud that is initially in approximate hydrostatic equilibrium, with \\ncs\\n\\n2 → c\\neff\\n2 = cs\\n\\n2 + vA\\n\\n2 + v\\nturb\\n2\\n including the effects of magnetic fields and turbulence as well as thermal pressure; Shu, Adams & Lizano (1987) suggest that c\\neff ≲ 2cs\\n, however. This infall rate explicitly depends only on the sound speed, but it implicitly depends on the density of the core: because the core was assumed to be initially in hydrostatic equilibrium, Equation 43 is equivalent to \\n\\n.',\n",
       "  \"There are two limiting cases for the gravitational collapse of an isothermal sphere. In the first case, originally considered by Larson (1969) and Penston (1969) and extended by Hunter (1977), one begins with a static cloud of constant density and follows the formation of the r\\n−2 density profile. At the time when the protostar first forms (i.e., when the central density reaches infinity in this idealized calculation), the collapse is highly dynamic, with an infall velocity of 3.3cs\\n. The infall rate onto the star is large, rapidly increasing from \\n\\n at the moment of protostar formation to \\n\\n. In the physically unrealistic case of an infinite, uniform medium, the accretion rate would remain at this high value; in practice, the accretion rate rapidly declines after the formation of a point mass (see below). In the opposite case, considered by Shu (1977), one assumes that the evolution to the r\\n−2 density profile is quasi-static (most likely owing to the effects of magnetic fields—see below), so that the infall velocities are negligible at the moment of protostar formation. The resulting initial configuration is the SIS, which is an unstable hydrostatic equilibrium. The collapse is initiated at the center, and the point at which the gas begins to fall inward propagates outward at the sound speed (the expansion wave): R\\new = cs t. This solution is therefore termed an inside-out collapse. For r ≥ R\\new, the density is that of a SIS, ρ = cs\\n\\n2/(2π Gr\\n2); for r < R\\new, the gas accelerates until it reaches free fall, with v = − (2Gm\\n\\\\*/r)1/2 and ρ0 ∝ r\\n−3/2. The generalized post-core-formation solutions of Hunter (1977) share the same density and velocity scalings at small radii. The infall rate for Shu's expansion wave solution is constant in time,\",\n",
       "  'The total mass inside the expansion wave at time t is \\n\\n, so that about half this mass is in the protostar (i.e., f\\new ≡ m\\n\\\\*/m\\new ≃ 1/2). Larson (2003) describes the Larson-Penston-Hunter and Shu solutions as fast and slow collapse, respectively, and suggests that reality is somewhere in between. A general discussion of the family of self-similar, isothermal collapse solutions has been given by Whitworth & Summers (1985).',\n",
       "  'Observations suggest that the cores that form low-mass stars initially have density profiles that approximate those of Bonnor-Ebert spheres (Section 3.1). Foster & Chevalier (1993) used time-dependent simulations to follow the collapse of such spheres under the assumption that support is by thermal pressure alone. They found that the collapse of the innermost, nearly uniform, part of a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere (i.e., one with a center-to-edge density contrast of 14.1) approaches, but does not reach, the Larson-Penston solution prior to and at the time of core formation. Shortly thereafter, the infall rate begins to decline; there is no phase of constant infall for a critical Bonnor-Ebert sphere. However, a sphere that is initially in an unstable equilibrium with a larger center-to-edge density contrast has an extended (outer) region in which the density scales as r\\n−2. In this case the infall rate starts off as in the critical Bonnor-Ebert case and then declines to the constant value for an SIS. The infall rate eventually decreases below the SIS value when a rarefaction wave from the boundary of the cloud reaches the origin (see Vorobyov & Basu 2005a). Numerical simulations of gravitational collapse in an unmagnetized, turbulent medium show that the initial spike and subsequent decline of the infall rate are typical (Schmeja & Klessen 2004).',\n",
       "  'Most of the theoretical work (except for simulations) on low-mass star formation has neglected the role of turbulence in the core. This is generally a valid approximation for low-mass cores, but it becomes increasingly inaccurate as the core mass increases. When turbulence is included, it is generally in the microturbulent approximation. Bonazzola et al. (1987, 1992) treated the turbulent pressure as being scale-dependent, and suggested that turbulence could stabilize GMCs while allowing smaller scales to undergo gravitational collapse. Lizano & Shu (1989) introduced a phenomenological model for turbulence, a logotropic equation of state (Section 2.2), to treat the contraction of the core. Myers & Fuller (1992) and Caselli & Myers (1995) modeled cores that are supported in part by turbulent motions with a density distribution that is the sum of an r\\n-r power-law for a thermal core and a flatter power-law for the turbulent envelope. Turbulent cores also can be approximately modeled as polytropes with γ\\np\\n < 1 (Section 2.2), and when cores collapse, the adiabatic index γ can exceed unity (McKee & Zweibel 1995; Vázquez-Semadeni, Canto & Lizano 1998). Ogino, Tomisako & Nakamuro (1999) generalized the Foster & Chevalier (1993) calculation and found that both the peak infall rate and the rate of decline of the infall rate are increased for γ = γ\\np\\n > 1. McLaughlin & Pudritz (1997) generalized the Shu solution to singular polytropic and singular logatropic spheres. They showed that the expansion wave accelerates in time as R\\new ∝ t\\n2−γ\\np\\n\\n and the infall rate increases as \\n\\n (logatropes correspond to γ\\np\\n → 0). The ratio of the mass in the protostar to that engulfed by the expansion wave is f\\new ≃ 1/2,1/6, and 1/33 for γ\\np\\n = 1,2/3, and a logatrope, respectively. The infall rate for a singular polytropic sphere can also be expressed as \\n\\n, where t\\nff is the free-fall time measured at the initial density of the gas just accreting onto the star and ϕ\\\\* ≃ 1.62 − 0.96/(2 − γ\\np\\n) (McKee & Tan 2002; this is valid for 0 < γ\\np\\n < 1.2). Inside-out collapse solutions for clouds that are initially contracting and that have γ ≠ γ\\np\\n have been developed by Fatuzzo, Adams & Myers (2004). For clouds that are supported in part by turbulence, the decay of the turbulence can initiate the collapse of the core (Myers & Lazarian 1998).',\n",
       "  'In the innermost regions of the collapsing core, the opacity eventually becomes large enough that the gas switches from approximately isothermal behavior to adiabatic behavior. The initial calculations were carried out by Larson (1969), and recent calculations include those by Masunaga, Miyama & Inutsuka (1998), Masunaga & Inutsuka (2000), and Wuchterl & Tscharnuter (2003); all assume spherical symmetry. The gas begins to become adiabatic at a density ρ ∼ 10−13 g cm−3. The first core forms when the gas becomes hot enough to stop the collapse, and an accretion shock forms at a radius ∼ 5 AU and with an enclosed mass ∼0.05 M\\n⊙. Once the gas is hot enough to dissociate the molecular hydrogen, a second collapse ensues and the protostar is formed. When opacity effects are included, the maximum infall rate is limited to about 13cs\\n\\n3/G (Larson 2003), and the average infall rate over the time required to assemble 80% of the final stellar mass is about 1.5–3 times the SIS value (Wuchterl & Tscharnuter 2003).',\n",
       "  'The two classical problems of star formation are the angular momentum problem and the magnetic flux problem: A star has far less angular momentum and magnetic flux than an equivalent mass in the ISM. Magnetic fields effectively remove angular momentum so long as the contraction of the core is sub-Alfvénic and the neutral and ionized components of the infalling gas are reasonably well coupled (e.g., Mestel 1985, Mouschovias 1987). Once either of these conditions breaks down, the gas will collapse with (near-)constant specific angular momentum, j = ϖ v\\nϕ, where ϖ is the cylindrical radius, provided the transport of angular momentum by turbulence and gravitational torques is unimportant. For collapse at constant j, a disk will form with a radius',\n",

In the collapse to a disk, the radius shrinks by a factor 3 βrot. Note that if the rotational velocity is proportional to the velocity dispersion, as might be expected for a cloud supported by turbulent motions (Burkert & Bodenheimer 2000), then βrot (ϖ0) is constant (Goodman et al. 1993), and the disk radius is a fixed fraction of the initial radius. However, clouds supported primarily by thermal pressure are generally assumed to be in uniform rotation. Recall that Goodman et al.

       "  'As in the nonrotating case, two limits for rotating collapse have received the greatest attention. These studies have generally assumed isothermality and have focused on inviscid, axisymmetric flow, although the latter conditions are likely to be violated in real disks, as discussed in Section 4.2 below. If the core initially has constant density and is rotating slowly, then it collapses to a disk that evolves to a configuration with a singular surface density profile, Σ ∝ ϖ−1 (Norman, Wilson & Barton 1980; Narita, Hayashi & Miyama 1984). The self-similar solution for the collapse of a rotating disk has been obtained by Saigo & Hanawa (1998), who pointed out that this solution is the analog of the Larson-Penston-Hunter solution for nonrotating collapse (i.e., it includes the time after the formation of the central singularity in Σ). A quasi-equilibrium disk with a radius Rd\\n ≃ j\\n2/Gm\\n\\\\*d\\n (Equation 45) grows after formation of the central singularity. Because both M(ϖ) and j scale as ϖ2 in the inner part of the initial spherical cloud, it follows that j ∝ M(ϖ0). Angular momentum is conserved during disk formation, so when a mass M(ϖ0) = m\\n\\\\*d\\n has collapsed into the disk, Rd\\n ∝ j\\n2/m\\n\\\\*d\\n ∝ m\\n\\\\*d\\n, which grows linearly in time in the isothermal case. Note also that because Σ ∝ ϖ−1 in the disk, it follows that after disk formation M and therefore j ∝ ϖ; as a result, the rotational velocity in the disk is constant, independent of ϖ. The infall rate into the central disk is about (3 − 11)cs\\n\\n3/G, depending on the angular momentum; this is significantly less than that for the nonrotating Larson-Penston-Hunter solution (Saigo & Hanawa 1998). In this solution the gas outside the equilbrium disk is dynamically contracting and is assumed to be itself in a thin disk. Numerical calculations indicate that relaxation of the thin disk approximation increases the accretion rate by about a factor of two for the case they considered.',\n",
       "  'Alternatively, if the core settles into a centrally concentrated, spherical, quasi-equilibrium state prior to collapse, a slow, inside-out collapse ensues. The density distribution of the supersonically infalling gas in the vicinity of the disk has been determined by Ulrich (1976) and by Cassen & Moosman (1981) under the assumptions that the mass is dominated by the central protostar and that the gas is spherically symmetric far from the protostar. The outer radius of the disk is given by Equation 45, but the disk is far from Keplerian—there is a large inward velocity that leads to a dynamically contracting outer disk and quasi-equilibrium inner disk (Stahler et al. 1994). This solution for the inner part of the infall can be joined smoothly to the solution for the collapse of an SIS (Terebey, Shu & Cassen 1984). More generally, if the cloud initially has a power-law density profile (ρ ∝ r\\n−kρ) with k\\nρ > 1, then it is straightforward to show that, for Ω0 = const, the disk radius is \\n\\n. For the collapse of a slowly rotating SIS (k\\nρ = 2), this equation implies that the disk radius varies as Rd\\n ∝ m\\n\\\\*d\\n\\n3 ∝ t\\n3 (Cassen & Moosman 1981). This rapid increase in disk radius with time is based on the assumption that the cloud can evolve to a rigidly rotating SIS. Subsequent work (described below) shows that even when magnetic fields are included, this condition is difficult to realize, and Rd\\n tends to increase only linearly with time.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nEffects of magnetic fields.\\n\\u2003\\n Poloidal magnetic fields prevent gravitational collapse when they are sufficiently strong (subcritical cores), and they inhibit contraction otherwise (supercritical cores), as discussed in Section 2.2. Magnetic tension acts to dilute the force of gravity. In nonrotating disks, this effect can be modeled approximately by adopting an effective gravitational constant (Basu 1997, Nakamura & Hanawa 1997, Shu & Li 1997), G\\neff = (1 − μΦ\\n−2)G, where μΦ ≡ M/M\\nΦ (Section 2.2) is assumed to be independent of r and must be greater than unity for gravitationally bound clouds; this equation is exact if the disk is also thin (Shu & Li 1997). As a result, the mass of a thin, nonrotating, isothermal, magnetically supercritical disk in equilibrium is M(r) = [1/(1 − μΦ\\n−2)]2cs\\n\\n2\\nr/G (Li & Shu 1996), which can be much larger than in the absence of magnetic support. If such a disk is initially in static equilibrium (which is difficult to arrange), the infall rate resulting from an inside-out collapse has ϕin = 1/(1 − μΦ\\n−2) in Equation 43 to within about 5% (Li & Shu 1997, Allen, Shu & Li 2003).',\n",
       "  'Mouschovias and his students have carried out an extensive set of calculations on the evolution of a magnetized disk assuming that the disk is thin and axisymmetric, which reduces the calculation to one spatial dimension. They followed the evolution from a subcritical initial state to supercritical collapse under the influence of ambipolar diffusion (Fiedler & Mouschovias 1993), including the effects of charged grains (Ciolek & Mouschovias 1994, 1996, 1998) and rotation (Basu & Mouschovias 1994, 1995a,b). In these calculations, the magnetic field has a characteristic hour-glass shape in which the field is normal to the disk and flares above and below it; observations that are consistent with this geometry have been obtained recently at a resolution of 700 AU (Girart, Rao & Marrone 2006). Galli & Shu (1993a,b) show that even if the magnetized core began with a spherical shape, it would collapse to a disk, which they term a pseudodisk as it is not rotationally supported. The calculations of Mouschovias and his students cited above typically began in a very subcritical state, with μΦ ≃ 0.25, and stopped when the central density reached 109.5 cm−3, which is about the point at which the central regions are expected to become opaque and nonisothermal. They found that thermal pressure exerts an outward force ≃30% of that due to gravity, whereas centrifugal accelerations are negligible in this phase of evolution. The central part of the core undergoes an extended phase of evolution until it becomes supercritical, at which point the contraction accelerates and the mass-to-flux ratio increases more slowly.',\n",
       "  '\\nBasu (1997) has given a semianalytic treatment of these results. He showed that the surface density profile in the inner core is \\n\\n, where Σ\\nc\\n is the central surface density and \\nR(t) = 2cs\\n\\n2/GΣ\\nc\\n (t) is the radius of the region in which thermal pressure is sufficiently strong to maintain an approximately constant density (Narita, Hayashi & Miyama 1984 found a similar result for rotating collapse without a magnetic field). The supercritical core has a radius R\\ncrit obtained by setting the central surface density equal to twice the critical value [Σ\\nc\\n = μΦ\\nB\\n0/(2π G\\n1/2) with μϕ = 2, where B\\n0 is the initial field strength in the core]. He showed that the slow increase in the mass-to-flux ratio, μΦ ∝ Σ0.05, results in a significant reduction in magnetic support at high densities. The density profile in the inner part of the disk (r ≪ R\\ncrit) has k\\nρ ≃ 2, but the increasing relative importance of magnetic forces in the outer regions cause it to flatten out so that the mean value in the entire core is k\\nρ ≃ 1.6. Basu found that the rotational velocity is independent of r, just as Saigo & Hanawa (1998) did for the nonmagnetic case. Extending the problem to include the time after protostar formation, Contopoulos, Ciolek & Königl (1998) obtained a similarity solution to the nonrotating collapse problem with ambipolar diffusion and found an infall rate \\n\\n at the time of protostar formation. Two-dimensional numerical calculations have confirmed this result and have shown that the infall rate subsequently drops by somewhat less than a factor of 2 (Ciolek & Königl 1998).',\n",
       "  '\\nShu, Li & Allen (2004) have considered very different initial conditions, in which a uniform field threads a SIS. Because the flux-to-mass ratio is zero at the origin and increases outward, magnetic effects are negligible at the center and become important only at a characteristic length scale R\\nch = π c\\n2\\n\\ns\\n/G\\n1/2\\nB, corresponding to the condition that MG\\n ∼ M\\nΦ (a similar length scale arises in studies of collapse with ambipolar diffusion, as may be inferred from Basu & Mouschovias 1995b). They follow the collapse under the assumption that the flux is frozen to the gas and find that the infall rate declines after the expansion wave reaches R\\nch; this is analogous to the result of Ciolek & Mouschovias (1995), who found a similar result for the case of collapse with ambipolar diffusion when the expansion wave reached a point at which the ambipolar diffusion was inhibited by photoionization. The initial conditions assumed by Shu, Li & Allen (2004) lead to a poloidal field that decreases inward, whereas calculations that start from nonsingular initial conditions and include ambipolar diffusion find that the poloidal field strongly increases inward.',\n",
       "  'A full similarity solution for the evolution of the collapsing core after it has fallen into a thin disk and a protostar has formed at the center, including rotation, magnetic fields, and ambipolar diffusion, has been obtained by Krasnopolsky & Königl (2002). They assumed that the gas is in a thin disk with a constant rotational velocity (see above); how this assumption would be affected by turbulence, which would thicken the disk and transport angular momentum, is unclear. The infalling gas goes through two shocks, a C-shock (which has a structure dominated by ambipolar diffusion—e.g., Draine & McKee 1993) and a shock at the outer edge of the centrifugally supported disk. When the protostar reaches 1 M\\n⊙, the C-shock is at about 103 AU and the centrifugal shock is at about 102 AU, consistent with data on T Tauri systems (see Section 4.2.1 below). Within the self-similar framework, they found that magnetic braking can be adequate to maintain accretion onto the central protostar; in this case there would be no need for internal disk stresses to drive accretion. The infall rate in their fiducial case is 4.7cs\\n\\n3/G; for a gas at 10 K, this corresponds to a star-formation time \\n\\n years. Their solution does not include an outflow, but they show how one might be included and estimate that this could reduce the accretion rate by a factor of ≲3. In sum, based on the theoretical work to date, it is clear that the infall rate is proportional to c\\neff\\n3/G, where c\\neff is an effective sound speed (Stahler, Shu & Taam 1980), but the value of the coefficient and its time dependence have yet to be determined in realistic cases.',\n",
       "  'The magnetic flux problem in star formation is that stars have very large values for the mass-to-flux ratio (μΦ ∼ 104 − 105 in magnetic stars, ∼ 108 in the Sun—Nakano 1983), whereas they form from gas with μΦ ∼ 1. This problem does not have an adequate solution yet, but it appears that it must be resolved in part on scales ≲ 1000 AU and in part on smaller (∼AU) scales. Detailed calculations of the ionization state of the infalling and accreting gas show that the ionization becomes low enough that the field decouples from the gas at densities of order 1010.5 − 1011.5 cm−3 (Nishi, Nakano & Umebayashi 1991; Desch & Mouschovias 2001; Nakano, Nishi & Umebayashi 2002); decoupling occurs at a somewhat lower density after the formation of the central protostar, owing to the stronger gravitational force (Ciolek & Königl 1998). Li & McKee (1996) showed that once the field decouples from the gas, magnetic flux accumulates in the accretion disk as the gas flows through the field and onto the protostar. The pressure associated with this field is strong enough to drive a C-shock (which has a structure dominated by ambipolar diffusion) into the infalling gas. The radius of the shock is predicted to be several thousand AU at the end of the infall phase of a 1-M\\n⊙ star; inside the shock, the field is approximately uniform (except close to the star) and the gas settles into an infalling, dense disk that they identified with the outer disk observed in HL Tau (Hayashi, Ohashi & Miyama 1993).',\n",
       "  'These results have been confirmed and improved upon by Contopoulos, Ciolek & Königl (1998), Ciolek & Königl (1998), and Krasnopolsky & Königl (2002). Tassis & Mouschovias (2005) have carried out 2D axisymmetric calculations with careful attention to the evolution of the ionization and find that the location of the shock oscillates, leading to fluctuations in the accretion rate; it is important to determine if this effect persists in a full 3D simulation. Tassis & Mouschovias (2007a,b,c) find that the magnetic field in the central region (r ≲ 10 AU) is about 0.1 G at the end of their calculation, when the central star has a mass ∼0.01 M\\n⊙; this is at the low end of the fields inferred in the early solar nebula from meteorites, which are in the range of 0.1 = 10 G (Morfill, Spruit & Levy 1993). They show that ohmic dissipation becomes as important as ambipolar diffusion at densities ≳ 1012.5 cm−3, but it does not affect the total magnetic flux. However, even though these processes significantly reduce the field within a few AU of the protostar, they are not sufficient to reduce the magnetic flux in the protostar to the observed value (Nakano & Umebayashi 1986, Li & McKee 1996, Ciolek & Königl 1998, Li 1998, Tassis & Mouschovias 2005). It is possible that turbulent diffusion (Li & McKee 1996) or magnetic reconnection (Mestel & Strittmatter 1967, Galli & Shu 1993b) plays a role in further reducing the magnetic flux. Reconnection alters the topology of the field and can displace the region in which the flux crosses the forming or accreting disk. However, reconnection cannot actually destroy flux (a common misconception), because at sufficient distance from the protostar the plasma is a good conductor and the total flux inside this conductor must be conserved. At the present time, the solution to the magnetic flux problem remains incomplete.',\n",
       "  'As remarked above (Section 4.1.1), magnetic fields are thought to play a critical role in solving the classical angular momentum problem by means of magnetic braking (Mestel 1985, Mouschovias 1987). Indeed, magnetic braking when the field is frozen to the matter is so effective that Allen, Li & Shu (2003) and Galli et al. (2006) have argued that magnetic reconnection is required to reduce the field and therefore the braking enough that a Keplerian disk can form. The infall solution of Krasnopolsky & Königl (2002), which includes ambipolar diffusion, and the numerical simulations of Hujeirat et al. (2000), which include both turbulence and ambipolar diffusion, suggest that Keplerian disks can form without reconnection, but nonetheless indicate that predicting the evolution of the specific angular momentum of the infalling gas is a complex problem. However, it is not clear that any of these theoretical models are consistent with the observations of Ohashi et al. (1997), which show that the specific angular momentum in gas associated with several protostars in Taurus is constant for 10−3 pc < r < 0.03 pc.',\n",
       "  'Numerical simulations, as opposed to numerical integration of the underlying partial differential equations, are required to study core collapse in 2D or 3D without additional assumptions (such as self-similarity or a thin-disk condition). A critical review of numerical simulations of low-mass star formation is given by Klein et al. (2007). To date, such simulations have not included ambipolar diffusion, nor have they simultaneously included radiative transfer and magnetic fields; most simulations have also stopped prior to the formation of the protostar. A prediction of these simulations is that a slow (v ∼ cs\\n ∼ 0.2 km s−1) outflow should occur at large radii (∼103 AU; Tomisaka 1998, 2002; Banerjee & Pudritz 2006). These authors suggest that this outflow is related to the observed bipolar outflows, but Allen, Li & Shu (2003) disagree. In any case, this large-scale outflow could be important in setting the outer boundary conditions for the jets and higher-velocity outflows that are observed (see Sections 4.2.4, 4.2.5).',\n",
       "  'Once a protostar star has formed by gravitational collapse of a core, it can continue to grow by gravitational accretion from the ambient medium. Most treatments of this process do not distinguish between the gas that accretes directly onto the star and the gas that first falls onto the disk. Hoyle & Lyttleton (1939) first developed the theory of accretion by a moving point mass, and Bondi (1952) extended the theory to the case in which the star is at rest in a medium of finite temperature. Today, gravitational accretion by a stationary object is generally referred to as Bondi accretion, whereas that by a moving object is referred to as Bondi-Hoyle accretion. If the density and sound speed far from the star are ρ and cs\\n, respectively, and the star is moving at a velocity \\n\\n through the ambient medium, then the characteristic radius from which the star accretes is',\n",

(d) The ambient gas is moving at a uniform velocity. In fact, gas in molecular clouds is generally supersonically turbulent, so that an accreting star experiences large fluctuations in both the density and velocity of the accreting material.

       "  'The dominant paradigm for star formation is gravitational collapse, but an alternative is that stars (or at least relatively massive stars) are formed primarily by the capture and subsequent accretion of matter that is initially unbound to the star (Zinnecker 1982, Bonnell et al. 1997). Because protostars compete for gas from a common reservoir, this process is termed “competitive accretion.” The simulations of Bonnell et al. (1997) show that a few of the fragments gain most of the mass; these are the ones that reside primarily in the central regions of the clump and have the highest accretion rates. Because gravitational accretion scales as m\\n\\\\*\\n2, initial differences in protostellar masses are amplified. This process has the potential of producing the IMF, and it also naturally leads to massive stars being centrally concentrated in clusters, as observed (Bonnell et al. 2001b). A key issue for competitive accretion is, What is the level of turbulence in the ambient medium? There is general agreement that competitive accretion is ineffective if the medium has turbulent energy comparable to gravitational energy, with αvir order unity (see Equation 11), whereas it is effective if the turbulence is sufficiently weak, αvir ≪ 1 (Bonnell et al. 2001a; Krumholz, McKee & Klein 2005a; magnetic fields, which tend to suppress accretion, have not been considered yet). Bonnell and his collaborators (Bonnell & Bate 2006 and references therein) argue that the gas throughout star-forming clumps has a very low turbulent velocity so that protostars in clusters can accrete efficiently. However, Krumholz, McKee & Klein (2005a) argue that stellar feedback and the cascade of turbulence from larger scales ensure that the star-forming clumps are sufficiently turbulent to be approximately virialized and to therefore have negligible competitive accretion. Analysis of data from several star-forming clumps shows that stars in these clumps could grow by only 0.1 − 1% in a dynamical time; this is far too small to be significant. The timescale for the formation of star clusters is an important discriminant between these models: Star clusters form in about 2t\\nff if turbulence is allowed to decay (Bonnell, Bate & Vine 2003), whereas it can take significantly longer if turbulence is maintained (Bonnell, Bate & Vine 2003). The observational evidence discussed by Tan, Krumholz & McKee (2006) and Krumholz & Tan (2007) favors the longer formation time. This controversy can be resolved through more detailed observations of gas motions in star-forming clumps and through more realistic simulations that allow for the evolution of the turbulent density fluctuations as the clump forms and evolves to a star-forming state, and that incorporate stellar feedback.',\n",
       "  'The growth of protostars can be inferred through observations of the mass distribution surrounding the protostar, the velocity distribution of this circumstellar gas, and the nonstellar radiative flux. The mass and/or temperature distribution on both small and large spatial scales can be inferred by modeling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the continuum. Protostellar SEDs are conventionally divided into four classes, which are believed to represent an evolutionary progression [Myers et al. (1987) divided sources into two classes; Lada (1987) introduced Classes I–III; Adams, Lada & Shu (1987) discussed a similar classification; and André, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (1993) introduced Class 0]. André, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (2000) have summarized the classification scheme:',\n",
       "  'These classes can also be defined in terms of the bolometric temperature, which is the temperature of a black body with the same mean frequency as the SED of the YSO (Myers & Ladd 1993).',\n",
       "  'Unfortunately, the geometry of the source can confound this classification scheme (e.g., Masunaga & Inutsuka 2000). It is well recognized that a given source can appear as a Class II source at small or moderate inclination angles (so that the central star is visible) and as a Class I source at large inclination angles (so that the central source is obscured by the disk). A similar ambiguity can involve Class 0 sources if the protostellar envelope is flattened owing to the presence of a large-scale magnetic field or contains cavities created by protostellar jets. White et al. (2007) summarize the observational evidence that many of the properties of Class I and Class II sources are similar, which is consistent with inclination effects confusing the evolutionary interpretation of the SEDs. This ambiguity can be alleviated by radio or submillimeter observations of the envelopes, which yield masses that are independent of inclination; Motte & André (2001) find that about 40% of the sources in Taurus that are classified as Class I on the basis of their SEDs have envelope masses <0.1 M\\n⊙ and are thus unlikely to be true protostars. More sophisticated modeling of the SEDs can also clarify the evolutionary sequence of YSOs; for example, Robitaille et al. (2006) have calculated 2 × 105 model SEDs, including the effects of outflow cavities, that can be automatically compared with observed SEDs to infer the properties of the source. Counts of sources at different evolutionary stages together with an estimate for the age for one of the stages allows one to infer the lifetimes for all the stages. Typical estimates for the ages are 1 − 2 × 105 years for Class I sources and 1 − 3 × 104 years for Class 0 sources (André, Ward-Thompson & Barsony 2000).',\n",

If the fraction of the core mass that goes into the star is εcore ≃ 1/3 (Matzner & McKee 2000; Alves, Lombardi & Lada 2007), and if the envelope infall rate is that expected from rotating, magnetized collapse (ϕin ≃ 5—Krasnopolsky & Königl 2002), then the infall rate is \\n\\n year−1. Observationally, the properties of the envelopes around Class I objects inferred from the SEDs give similar infall rates (Kenyon, Calvet & Hartmann 1993), so this estimate for ϵcore ϕin cannot be too far off. (b) A direct estimate of the average accretion rate is that forming a 0.5 M\\n⊙ star in 2 × 105 years, the estimated upper limit on the duration of the embedded stage, requires \\n\\n year−1, comparable to the estimated infall rate. The average luminosity corresponding to this accretion rate is 〈L〉 ≃ 8 L\\n⊙. The problem is that the observed median luminosity of the bona fide Class I sources (i.e., those with significant molecular envelopes) in Taurus is about 0.5 − 1 L\\n⊙ (White & Hillenbrand 2004 and Motte & André 2001, respectively), almost an order of magnitude smaller. The problem is significantly worse than this, however, as only a small fraction of the luminosity is due to accretion (Muzerolle, Hartmann & Calvet 1998); White & Hillenbrand (2004) find that the fraction is about 25%. The clearest statement of the luminosity problem is as an accretion rate problem: The observed accretion rates in Class I protostars are 1–2 orders of magnitude smaller than those needed to form a star during the lifetime of a Class I object.',\n",
       "  '\\nKenyon et al. (1990) suggested two solutions to this problem. One solution is that significant accretion continues into the T Tauri stage, but this appears to be ruled out by the fact that such stars accrete very slowly (10−8\\nM\\n⊙ year−1; see Section 4.2.1), and there is not a significant disk or envelope mass reservoir that they can draw on for episodic accretion. The other solution is that most of the accretion occurs in the embedded stage, but it is episodic, so that the median accretion rate is much smaller than the mean. They suggested that the high accretion-rate stage of protostellar accretion could correspond to FU Orionis objects, which are very luminous (typically 200 − 800 L\\n⊙—Hartmann & Kenyon 1996) and have have accretion rates ∼10−4\\nM\\n⊙ year−1. Such outbursts could be due to thermal instability (Bell & Lin 1994, Bell et al. 1995), although this would only affect the inner disk, and hence the outburst would be limited in duration and total mass accreted; or to gravitational instability in the disk (see Section 4.2.2 and Vorobyov & Basu 2005b, 2006). However, Hartmann & Kenyon (1996) estimate that the observed FU Ori objects can account for only about 5 − 20% of the mass of stars forming in the solar vicinity; this discrepancy has not disappeared in the intervening decade. Recent observational studies of the central stars in Class I sources differ on their evolutionary status: White & Hillenbrand (2004) argue that the Class I protostars are similar to TTSs and are thus past the main protostellar accretion phase, whereas Doppmann et al. (2005) come to the opposite conclusion. If protostars are close to their final mass by the time they become Class I sources, then they must gain most of their mass in the Class 0 stage. In this case the luminosity problem remains, albeit in a milder form: The mean accretion rate required to form a 0.5 M\\n⊙ star in 3 × 104 years (the estimated upper limit on the lifetime of a Class 0 source—André, Ward-Thompson & Barsony 2000) is 1.7 × 10−5\\nM\\n⊙ year−1, corresponding to \\n\\n; by contrast, the median luminosity of the Class 0 sources listed by André, Ward-Thompson & Barsony (2000) is about 10 L\\n⊙. This luminosity problem could be alleviated if a significant fraction of the accretion energy is carried off by the powerful protostellar outflows that accompany these sources, so that f\\nacc ≲ 1/2. However, accounting for a value of the infall rate as high as the inferred accretion rate onto the star remains a theoretical challenge: The magnetized collapse models discussed above give infall rates of a few × 10−6\\nM\\n⊙ year−1 (for εcore ∼ 1/3), significantly less than required. A resolution of the luminosity problem thus remains elusive.',\n",
       "  'Spectroscopic observations using molecular transitions can give both the mass and velocity distributions in collapsing cores (Myers, Evans & Ohashi 2000), but to date the spatial resolution of these data is generally ≳ 100 AU. Evidence for infall in unresolved cores is provided by the infall asymmetry (Lucas 1976, Leung & Brown 1977, Myers et al. 1996): optically thick, infalling gas in which the excitation temperature rises toward the center produces a characteristic line profile in which the blue wing is stronger than the red wing. Observations of samples of starless cores (Lee, Myers & Tafalla 1999, 2001), Class 0 sources (Gregersen et al. 1997), and Class I sources (Gregersen et al. 2000) show a blue excess [(blue asymmetries—red asymmetries)/(number of sources)] of about 0.25 − 0.35, indicating that many of these sources are undergoing collapse (Myers, Evans & Ohashi 2000). Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to carry out unambiguous observational tests of the theoretical models for protostellar accretion. Furuya, Kitamura & Shinnaga (2006) mapped the infall in a young Class 0 source and found reasonably good agreement with the Larson-Penston-Hunter solution (ϕin ≃ 20 in Equation 43); this source appears to be very young, because for r > 100 AU there is no evidence for the ρ ∝ r\\n−3/2 density profile expected for accretion onto a protostar of significant mass. Tafalla et al. (1998) and Lee, Myers & Tafalla (2001) found that infall is more extended than expected in inside-out collapse models, although this infall may reflect the formation of small clusters rather than individual stars. They also found that the infall velocity is faster than expected in standard ambipolar diffusion models; however, the velocities are consistent with the collapse of magnetically supercritical cores (Ciolek & Basu 2000). A potentially important result is that Ohashi et al. (1997) found that cores in Taurus are in solid body rotation on scales ≳ 0.03 pc but conserve angular momentum on smaller scales. The physical significance of this length scale could be inferred by determining its value in other molecular clouds.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nBrown dwarfs.\\n\\u2003\\n Because brown dwarfs represent the low-mass extreme of star formation, they can shed light on the earliest stages of star formation. As a result of a great deal of observational work over the past decade, it has been established that most brown dwarfs form by the same mechanism as most stars (Luhman et al. 2007, Whitworth et al. 2007): the IMF, velocity and spatial distributions at birth, multiplicity, accretion rates, circumstellar disks, and outflows are all continuous extensions of those for hydrogen-burning stars. This is to be expected, as stars near the H-burning limit at 0.075 M\\n⊙ reach their final mass long before hydrogen burning commences. Following Whitworth et al. (2007) and Chabrier et al. (2007), we shall assume that brown dwarfs form by gravitational instability on a dynamical timescale, and that their composition reflects that of the ambient ISM. By contrast, planets are believed to form in circumstellar disks and to have an elemental composition with an excess of heavy elements. With these definitions, the observational distinction between giant planets with masses ≳ MJ\\n and small brown dwarfs is somewhat indistinct, but should eventually be amenable to spectroscopic determination (Chabrier et al. 2007). The lower limit to the mass of a brown dwarf is set by the condition that the star becomes opaque to the radiation it emits while undergoing gravitational collapse (Low & Lynden-Bell 1976); including helium, this is about 4 × 10−3\\nM\\n⊙ ≃ 4 MJ\\n\\n (Whitworth et al. 2007). The smallest brown dwarfs detected to date have masses ∼(0.01 − 0.02) M\\n⊙ (Luhman et al. 2007).',\n",
       "  'In order for a brown dwarf to form, its mass must exceed the Bonnor-Ebert mass, even if it forms via shock compression (Elmegreen & Elmegreen 1978); the pressure at the surface of the core that forms the brown dwarf must therefore be \\n\\n K cm−3. Assuming that brown dwarfs form by turbulent fragmentation, Padoan & Nordlund (2004) show that such pressures can be reached in a large enough fraction of the mass of the cluster IC348 to account for the brown dwarfs observed there. This model is based on the asumption that the gas is isothermal and that as a result the density PDF is a log-normal distribution (Equation 5). The remaining mystery is, Why is the IMF of brown dwarfs relatively constant (at least to within a factor of two) when their numbers are exponentially sensitive to the mean of the log-normal distribution, which depends on the Mach number at the largest scale in the cloud? This is part of the larger mystery as to why the IMF appears to be universal, but in the brown dwarf regime the exponential sensitivity to ambient conditions potentially offers an opportunity to determine how ambient conditions affect the IMF.',\n",

       "  '\\n\\nBinaries.\\n\\u2003\\n Stars are roughly evenly divided between those that are in multiple systems (mainly binaries) and those that are single. For stars of mass ∼1 M\\n⊙, Duquennoy & Mayor (1991) found that the fraction of stellar systems that are multiple—i.e., the ratio of the total number of binaries, triples, etc. divided by the total number of systems, including single stars—is f\\nmult = 0.58. Multiplicity declines for smaller masses, and Reid & Gizis (1997) find f\\nmult ≃ 0.3 for stars in the Solar Neighborhood, which are primarily M stars. Lada (2006) finds a similar result when one averages over the entire IMF: The majority of stellar systems (as opposed to the majority of stars) are single. The fraction of singles is smaller at birth, however: Higher-order multiples (triples, etc.) are often dynamically unstable, and in dense environments collisions among stellar systems can disrupt wide binaries (Kroupa, Petr & McCaughrean 1999). Observations summarized by Duchêne et al. (2007) show that the multiplicity among TTSs in low-density associations such as Taurus-Auriga and Ophiuchus and among Class I sources in high-density regions such as L1641 in Orion is about twice as high as among field stars. In dense star-forming regions like Orion, however, this excess multiplicity is soon erased—for example, the multiplicity in the Orion Nebula Cluster (which is older than L1641) is the same as in the field. This introduces a complication in comparing the CMF with the IMF (Section 3.3): On average, cores produce more than one star, and the properties of the resulting stellar systems evolve with time. This is not a major complication, however, because each core typically produces only 2–3 stars (Goodwin & Kroupa 2005), and the distribution of secondary masses in typical binaries appears to follow the field star IMF (Goodwin et al. 2007). It should be noted that the multiplicity of the stars is imprinted on their spatial distribution: Larson (1995) found a clear break in the density of companions in Taurus at about 0.04 pc, separating binaries and multiple stars from larger scale clusters.',\n",
       "  'Binaries raise two important issues in the theory of star formation: What is the role of binaries in reducing the angular momentum inherited by protostars? What determines how molecular cores fragment? Binaries do not appear to be effective in taking up the angular momentum of the initial core: Fisher (2004) has shown that turbulent molecular cores must lose 99–99.9% of their initial angular momentum in order to qualitatively account for a number of features of the binary population with periods ≳ 103 days. This angular momentum loss is generally assumed to be due to magnetic braking (Section 4.1.1), but Jappsen & Klessen (2004) suggest that gravitational torques can also contribute. Binaries can remove angular momentum on small scales by ejecting a companion, which hardens the remaining binary. However, Goodwin & Kroupa (2005) point out two limitations on this process: (a) it tends to create equal mass binaries, which are not common for typical stars, and (b) it would create a population of single stars significantly larger than observed.',\n",
       "  'There is an extensive literature on the fragmentation of protostellar cores into binary and multiple protostars that is reviewed by Bodenheimer et al. (2000), Duchêne et al. (2007), and Goodwin et al. (2007). Simulations of fragmentation are very challenging because of the enormous range of scales involved, and it does not appear that any of the simulations carried out to date have enough resolution and enough physics (i.e., including MHD and radiative transfer) to adequately address the problem (Klein et al. 2007). In particular, a number of simulations produce 5–10 fragments per core, whereas observations show that most cores produce only 2–3 fragments (Goodwin & Kroupa 2005).',\n",
       "  'Because protostellar cores are rotating, collapse with conservation of angular momentum results in the formation of a centrifugally-supported disk (Section 4.1.1). Observed sizes and rotation parameters for low-mass dense cores predict disk sizes ≲ 1000 AU, consistent with high-resolution submillimeter continuum observations that indicate average (dust) disk sizes around TTSs of ≈200 AU (Andrews & Williams 2006); similar results are obtained using millimeter interferometry (Kitamura et al. 2002). The disks around T Tauri disks extend inward to ∼0.04 AU based on modeling of observed CO vibrational emission lines (Najita et al. 2006); these inner radii are smaller than the inner disk radii inferred for dust disks, presumably because the dust sublimates. The initial sizes of circumstellar disks are more difficult to determine, because protostellar systems in the earliest stages (prior to the T Tauri stage) are still enshrouded in dusty envelopes that emit at similar wavelengths to the disk; in a few cases where the inner envelope emission can be spatially separated out, disk sizes appear similar (e.g., Jørgensen et al. 2005).',\n",
       "  'Masses of protostellar disks are estimated using the continuum flux in millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths. The first disk mass estimates for TTSs were obtained from observations of the total flux at a single millimeter wavelength under the assumption of optically thin emission (e.g., Beckwith et al. 1990), but subject to an uncertainty in the overall normalization owing to the uncertainty in the dust opacity coefficient [because M\\ndisk ∝ F\\nν/(ν2 κν)]. Multiwavelength (submillimeter to centimeter) observations suggest that the dust opacity law κν ∝ νβ has a distinctly shallower slope β than holds for dust in the diffuse ISM, presumably owing to grain growth (e.g., Beckwith & Sargent 1991; Beckwith, Henning & Nakagawa 2000). Interpretation of the multiwavelength flux data as implying a change in β is complicated by the fact that some of the short-wavelength emission can be optically thick (which yields F\\nν ∝ ν2 independent of β for a disk that is optically thick at all ν). However, spatially resolved observations can be combined with modeling to correct for optically thick contributions varying with ν and R, with the resulting median being β ≲ 1 (e.g., Natta et al. 2007, Andrews & Williams 2007, Lommen et al. 2007), suggesting that the largest grains are in fact centimeter-size pebbles (e.g., Wilner et al. 2005, Rodmann et al. 2006). Total disk masses for T Tauri systems are estimated to be in the range ∼10−3 − 10−1\\nM\\n⊙ with a median near 0.005 M\\n⊙ from submillimeter observations (e.g., Andrews & Williams 2005), but these may severely underestimate the true masses if a large fraction of the grains have grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes and thus emit only weakly in the submillimeter (Hartmann et al. 2006, Natta et al. 2007). Determining the distribution of mass within disks is difficult because submillimeter emission is likely optically thick in the inner regions, whereas at longer wavelengths there is insufficient resolution to probe the inner-disk regions (Andrews & Williams 2007). Finally, we note that disk mass determinations assume a cosmic ratio of gas to dust; at late evolutionary stages, photoevaporation may preferentially remove gas, and planet formation may preferentially remove dust.',\n",
       "  'The thermal structure of protostellar disks is likely quite complex. Disks can be heated both externally via irradiation from the central star, and internally from dissipation and thermalization of orbital kinetic energy as the gas accretes (Calvet et al. 1991, Chiang & Goldreich 1997). As a consequence, the vertical temperature distribution depends on details of the system and can have a local minimum at intermediate altitude (D’Alessio et al. 1998). The vertical temperature distribution together with its dependence on radius must be self-consistently calculated, because the flaring of the disk surface affects the amount of radiation intercepted from the central star (see discussion and references in Dullemond et al. 2007). In addition, gas and dust temperatures may differ in the upper atmospheres where the densities are low and stellar X rays strongly heat the gas (Najita et al. 2006). Quite sophisticated radial-vertical radiative models (including grain growth and settling) have been developed that agree well with observed SEDs from micrometer to millimeter wavelengths [see e.g., Dullemond & Dominik (2004), D’Alessio et al. (2006) and references therein]. The IR emission signatures, including PAH features at 3 − 13 μ and edge-on silhouette images, as well as scattered-light/polarization observations in optical and near-IR frequencies, indicate that although some grains have grown to large sizes, small grains still remain in disk atmospheres (see references and discussion in Dullemond et al. 2007 and Natta et al. 2007).',\n",
       "  'Disk lifetimes are inferred based on stellar ages combined with IR and millimeter/submillimeter emission signatures, which are sensitive to warm dust. Multi-wavelength Spitzer observations of the nearby star-forming cluster IC 348 (Lada et al. 2006) show that for ∼70% of stars, disks have become optically thin in the IR (implying inner disks R ≲ 20 AU have been removed) within the 2- to 3-Myr age of the system; disk fractions are slightly higher (∼50%) for Solar-type stars than in those of higher or lower mass; observations of other clusters are consistent with these results (Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006a). L-band observations of disk frequencies in clusters spanning a range of ages (Haisch, Lada & Lada 2001) suggests that overall disk lifetimes are ≈6 Myr. Even in the 10-Myr-old cluster NCG 7160, however, a few percent of stars still show IR signatures of disks (Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006a), and disk lifetimes appear to be inversely correlated with the mass of the star (Hernandez et al. 2007). Signatures (or their absence) of dusty disk emission are also well correlated with evidence (or lack) of accretion in gaseous emission line profiles (see below) in systems at a range of ages, indicating that gas and dust disks have similar lifetimes (Jayawardhana et al. 2006, Sicilia-Aguilar et al. 2006b). Andrews & Williams (2005) found, for a large sample of YSOs in Taurus-Auriga, that in general those systems with near-IR signatures of inner disks also have submillimeter signatures of outer disks, and vice versa; they conclude that inner and outer disk lifetimes agree within 105 years.',\n",
       "  'Accretion in YSO systems is studied using a variety of diagnostics (see e.g., Calvet, Hartmann & Strom (2000)), including continuum veiling of photospheric absorption lines and optical emission lines, which are respectively believed to arise from hot (shocked) gas on the stellar surface and from gas that is falling onto the star along magnetic flux tubes. Gullbring et al. (1998) measured a median accretion rate for million-year-old TTSs of ∼10−8\\nM\\n⊙ year−1, and White & Ghez (2001) found similar accretion rates for the primaries in T Tauri binary systems. A recent compilation of observations (White & Basri 2003, Muzerolle et al. 2003, Calvet et al. 2004) shows an approximate dependence of the accretion rate on stellar mass \\n\\n, although with considerable scatter (Muzerolle et al. 2005). This scaling of the accretion rate with stellar mass is potentially explained by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the ambient molecular cloud (Padoan et al. 2005). However, such a model accounts only for the infall rate onto the star-disk system, not the disk accretion rate; these need not agree. In addition, it does not account for the accretion seen in TTSs outside molecular clouds (Hartmann et al. 2006). During their embedded stages (a few × 105 years), low-mass stars have typical disk accretion rates similar to or slightly larger than those of T\\\\_Tauri Stars (TTSs) (White et al. 2007). As discussed in Section 4.1.3, the infall rates from protostellar envelopes typically exceed disk accretion rates by a factor of 10–100, so it is possible that mass is stored in the disk and released intermittently, in brief but prodigious accretion events similar to FU Ori outbursts (Kenyon et al. 1990, Hartmann & Kenyon 1996).',\n",
       "  'For high-mass protostars, observations suggest that there are at least two classes of disks (Cesaroni et al. 2007). In moderate-luminosity sources corresponding to B stars (L≲ a few ×104\\nL\\n⊙), the disks appear to be Keplerian, with masses significantly less than the stellar mass and timescales for mass transfer ∼105 years. In luminous sources (L ≳ 105\\nL\\n⊙), the disks are large (4 − 30 × 103 AU) and massive (60 − 500 M\\n⊙). Consistent with the discussion in Sections 4.1.1.1 and 4.1.1.2, the disks are observed to be non-Keplerian on these large scales. To distinguish these structures from the disks observed around B stars, Cesaroni (2005) terms them toroids. The inferred infall rates in these disks are of order 2 × 10−3 − 2 × 10−2\\nM\\n⊙ year−1, corresponding to mass transfer timescales of order 104 years (Zhang 2005). In view of their large size and mass, they may be circumcluster structures rather than circumstellar ones. Indeed, one of the best studied luminous sources, G10.8–0.4, is inferred to have an embedded cluster of stars with a total mass ∼300 M\\n⊙ (Sollins et al. 2005). Simulations of the formation of an individual massive star in a turbulent medium give a disk size ∼103 AU, significantly smaller than the size of the toroids (Krumholz, Klein & McKee 2005). To date, no disks have been observed in the luminous sources on scales ≲103 AU. Most likely, this is because of the observational difficulties in observing such disks; it should be borne in mind, however, that there is no direct evidence that these sources are in fact protostellar. Including disks around both B stars and the toroids around luminous sources, Zhang (2005) finds that the mass infall rate in the disks scales as \\n\\n, although there are substantial uncertainties in the data for the luminous sources.',\n",
       "  'The most fundamental theoretical question about YSO disks is what makes them accrete; although many mechanisms have been investigated, the problem is still open. In large part this is because the accretion process depends on a complicated interplay of MHD, radiative transfer, chemistry, and even solid state physics. The MHD is itself nonideal, because the medium is partially ionized, and in addition self-gravity is important in many circumstances. Self-gravity effects and the level of electrical conductivity are very sensitive to thermal and ionization properties, which in turn are determined by chemistry and radiative transfer (including X-rays and cosmic rays), and the latter are strongly affected by grain properties that evolve in time due to sticking and fragmentation. Compounding the difficulty imposed by the interactions among the physical processes involved is the lack of exact knowledge of initial and boundary conditions: How does collapse of the rotating protostellar core shape the distribution of mass in the disk, starting from the initial disk-building stage and continuing (although at a reduced rate) with later infall? Finally, there is the difficulty imposed by the huge dynamic range in space and time; disks themselves span a range of ∼104 in radius and 106 in orbital period, while the small aspect ratio H/R ≪ 1 (where H is the scale height of the disk) implies a further extension in dynamic range is required for numerical models that resolve the disk interior.',\n",
       "  'Processes proposed to transport angular momentum in YSO disks generally fall into one of three categories: purely hydrodynamic mechanisms, MHD mechanisms, and self-gravitating mechanisms (e.g., see the reviews of Stone et al. 2000 and Gammie & Johnson 2005). Within the past decade, it has become possible to investigate mechanisms in each class using high-resolution time-dependent numerical simulations in two and three dimensions, in which the stresses that produce transport are explicitly obtained as spatial correlations of component velocities, magnetic fields, and the density and pressure for a self-consistent flow. Prior to the computational revolution that made these investigations possible, and continuing into the present for modeling in which large radial domains and long-term evolution is required, many studies have made use of the so-called alpha prescription for angular momentum transport. In this approach (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974, Pringle 1981), a stress tensor is defined that yields an effective viscous torque between adjacent rings in a differentially rotating disk. On dimensional grounds, and using the fact that the shear stress should be zero for solid-body rotation, this stress can be written as \\n\\n; i.e., the effective kinematic viscosity is taken to obey \\n\\n. This effective viscosity Ansatz makes it possible to study disk evolution with a purely hydrodynamic, 1D model. Although the α-model approach has been essential to progress on modeling disk observables, it is limited in its ability to capture realistic dynamics because the coefficient is arbitrary (and usually taken as spatially constant) and the adopted functional form for T\\n\\nR,ϕ, though dimensionally correct, may not reproduce the true behavior of nonlinear, time-dependent, 3D flows (e.g., see Ogilvie 2003; Pessah, Chan & Psaltis 2007, submitted). For a Keplerian disk, −d ln Ω/d ln R = 3/2 and in steady state the mass accretion rate is \\n\\n; i.e., the ratio of radial inflow speed to orbital speed is \\n\\n. Observed accretion rates of TTSs require α ∼10−2 (Hartmann et al. 1998). Because the effective viscosity is equal to a characteristic length scale for angular momentum transport times at characteristic transport speed, the empirically determined viscosity corresponds to a few percent of the value that would be obtained if transport occurred at sonic speeds over distances comparable to the scale height of the disk.',\n",

This is not the case for TTSs, but during the embedded stages the disk masses may be larger, and (possibly as a consequence of larger M\\ndisk and self-gravity; see below) the values of α may be larger as well.',\n",

Turbulence generated either through convection (owing to vertical or radial entropy gradients), through shear-driven hydrodynamic instabilities, or through external agents (such as time-dependent, clumpy infall) could in principle develop velocity field correlations 〈ρ δ vR\\n δ vϕ〉 of the correct sign (>0) to transport angular momentum outward. Ryu & Goodman (1992) showed, however, that convective modes tend to transport angular momentum inward, rather than outward, and Stone & Balbus (1996) confirmed from 3D numerical simulations with turbulence driven by convection that angular momentum transport is inward. Convection driven by radial entropy gradients also transports angular momentum inward and is generally stabilized by differential rotation (Johnson & Gammie 2006).',\n",
       "  'Several analytic studies have shown that purely hydrodynamic disturbances in Keplerian-shear disks are able to experience large transient growth (Chagelishvili et al. 2003; Klahr 2004; Umurhan & Regev 2004; Johnson & Gammie 2005a; Afshordi, Mukhopadhyay & Narayan 2005), especially for the case of 2D (i.e., z-independent) columnar structures. Conceivably, transient growth of sheared waves could lead to self-sustained turbulence with outward transport of angular momentum, if new leading wavelets could be continually reseeded in the flow via nonlinear interactions (Lithwick 2007, submitted). Although transient growth is indeed seen in 2D (R − ϕ) numerical simulations, it is subject to secondary Kelvin-Helmholtz instability that limits the growth when \\n\\n (Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006). The turbulence that results also appears to decay without creating leading wavelets to complete the feedback loop, but this may be due to limited numerical resolution. Other numerical evidence, together with analytic arguments, suggest that nonlinear shear-driven hydrodynamic instabilities are unable to maintain turbulence for Rayleigh-stable rotational profiles (in which angular momentum increases outward, i.e., κ2/Ω2 = 2d ln (Ω R\\n2)/d ln R > 0) (Balbus, Hawley & Stone 1996; Hawley, Balbus & Winters 1999). Because simulations using the same numerical methods show that analogous Cartesian shear flows do exhibit nonlinear instability, rotating systems are presumably stabilized by Coriolis forces and the epicyclic motion that results. One potential concern is that the effective Reynolds numbers of numerical experiments are too low to realize nonlinear shear-driven instabilities and self-sustained turbulence. Very recently, however, Ji et al. (2006) reported from laboratory experiments at Reynolds numbers up to millions that hydrodynamic flows with Keplerian-like rotation profiles in fact show extremely low levels of angular momentum transport, corresponding to α < 10−6.',\n",
       "  'Although it may be difficult to grow perturbations from instabilities in uniform Keplerian disks, it is still possible that disks are born with large internal perturbations, and that ongoing infall at all radii can continually resupply them. Simulations have shown that 2D disks with nonuniform vorticity tend to develop large-scale, persistent vortices that are able to transport angular momentum outward (Umurhan & Regev 2004, Johnson & Gammie 2005b). Three-dimensional simulations, however, show that vortex columns tend to be destroyed (Barranco & Marcus 2005; Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006). Although off-midplane vortices can be long-lived (Barranco & Marcus 2005), the angular momentum transport in 3D simulations is an order of magnitude lower than for the 2D case (Shen, Stone & Gardiner 2006) and secularly decays. Further investigation of this process is needed, and it is particularly important to assess whether vorticity can be injected at a high enough rate to maintain the effective levels of α ∼10−2 needed to explain observed TTS accretion.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nMHD mechanisms.\\n\\u2003\\n The introduction of magnetic fields considerably alters the dynamics of circumstellar disks. The realization by Balbus & Hawley (1991) that weakly or moderately magnetized, differentially rotating disks are subject to a powerful local instability—now generically referred to as the MRI—revolutionized the theory of accreting systems. Early axisymmetric numerical simulations showed robust growth and development of the so-called channel solution (Hawley & Balbus 1991), whereas 3D numerical simimulations showed emergence of quasi-steady state saturated turbulence (Brandenburg et al. 1995; Hawley, Gammie & Balbus 1995; Matsumoto & Tajima 1995) in which the angular momentum transport is outward and is dominated by the magnetic stresses 〈 − BR B\\nϕ/(4π)〉. Much effort has been devoted to exploring the MRI as a basic mechanism driving accretion in a variety of systems; Balbus & Hawley (1998) and Balbus (2003) summarize many of these developments. The effective value of α depends on the mean vertical magnetic flux, which presumably evolves over long timescales, and can easily exceed 0.1 (e.g., Hawley, Gammie & Balbus 1996; Stone et al. 1996; Sano et al. 2004).',\n",
       "  \"Although MRI almost certainly plays an important role in driving accretion in YSO systems, it is not a magic bullet. The difficulty is that substantial portions of these disks may have ionization too low for MRI to be effective (Gammie 1996; Jin 1996; Glassgold, Najita & Igea 1997; D’Alessio et al. 1998; Igea & Glassgold 1999), creating a “dead zone.” A critical review of the requirements for MRI to develop in partially ionized disks is given in Gammie & Johnson (2005); Ohmic diffusion appears to be the main limiting effect, with the saturated-state value of α dropping when vA,z\\n\\n2/η Ω ≲ 1 where η is the resistivity (Sano & Stone 2002; Turner, Sano & Dziourkevitch 2006). In the very innermost parts of YSO disks (R ≲ 0.1 AU), alkali metals are collisionally ionized where the stellar irradiation maintains the temperature above ∼ 2000 K, so MRI can operate. In the outer disk (beyond several AU), and in the mid-disk's surface layers, column densities are low enough (Σ < Σ\\na\\n ∼ 100 g cm−2) that X rays or cosmic rays can penetrate the disk to ionize it. (For comparison, the surface density in the minimum Solar nebula is Σ = 1700(R/AU)-1.5 g cm−2—Hayashi, Nakazawa & Nakagawa 1985.) Unfortunately, the extent of the MRI-active region in the outer disk is very sensitive to the presence and size distribution of dust particles; if small grains are present and well-mixed, the active region is quite limited, whereas it can become very large if all the dust is incorporated in large particles or settles to the midplane (Sano et al. 2000; Fromang, Terquem & Balbus 2002; Desch 2004; Salmeron & Wardle 2005). Even if ionizing radiation is limited to the surface layers by high total disk columns, if small grains are absent (an extreme assumption) the gas-phase recombination rate is low enough such that turbulence with rapid vertical mixing can maintain non-negligible ionization in the interior. Turner, Sano & Dziourkevitch (2007) have shown, using direct numerical simulations, that the dead zone can be effectively eliminated in this (optimistic) scenario; though the very center of the disk at 1 AU is not unstable to MRI, the interior is still conductive enough that magnetic fields generated nearer the surface can induce accretion in the midplane.\",\n",
       "  'One of the possible consequences of spatially varying conductivity in disks is that the accretion rate will, in general, vary with radius. If only a surface layer Σ\\na\\n is active, in the sense of being sufficiently conductive to support MRI with effective viscosity coefficient α\\na\\n, then the accretion rate in that layer will be \\n\\n. Because Σ\\na\\n varies slowly with radius (for the case of external ionization) while the combination σth\\n2/Ω tends to decrease inward, dropout from the accretion flow can accumulate within the dead zone that is sandwiched between active layers (Gammie 1996). If the dead zone remains completely inactive, then matter will build up until it becomes dynamically unstable and begins to transport angular momentum by gravitational stresses (see below), potentially leading to transient bursts of accretion (Gammie 1996; Armitage, Livio & Pringle 2001).',\n",
       "  'Finally, we note that MHD winds (see Section 4.2.5) may remove angular momentum from disks, driving the matter remaining in the disk to accrete in order to maintain centrifugal balance. The angular momentum deficit is tranferred to the disk by magnetic stresses, so that only the matter that is well-coupled to magnetic fields will be affected. Thus, the above considerations regarding ionization also apply to wind-driven accretion.',\n",
       "  '\\n\\nSelf-gravitational mechanisms.\\n\\u2003\\n Accretion disks that have sufficiently small values of the Toomre parameter \\n\\n are subject to nonlinear growth of density perturbations via the swing amplifier (see Sections 2.2, 3.2.1). Then, in addition to hydrodynamic Reynolds stresses 〈ρ vR v\\nϕ〉 and MHD Maxwell stresses 〈BR B\\nϕ/(4π)〉, gravitational Newton stresses 〈gR g\\nϕ/(4π G)〉 (where g = − ∇ Φ) also contribute to the radial transport of angular momentum. Gammie (2001) showed that if the disk is in equilibrium such that cooling removes the energy dissipated by mass accretion at a rate per unit area Σσth\\n2/[(γ − 1)t\\ncool], then α−1 = (9/4)γ (γ − 1)Ω t\\ncool\\n, where γ is the effective (2D) adiabatic index (which takes into account vertical degrees of freedom, and depends on the 3D index and degree of self-gravity). Numerical simulations with simple cooling prescriptions (constant t\\ncool Ω) show that the disk can settle into a self-regulated state with Q near unity (Gammie 2001, Lodato & Rice 2004, Mejía et al. 2005, Rice, Lodato & Armitage 2005), provided that t\\ncool Ω is not too small (in which case the disk fragments). For disks that are not externally illuminated, Johnson & Gammie (2003) performed 2D simulations with realistic opacities (and a one-zone vertical radiative transfer approximation for cooling), and found that the transition between fragmentation and nonfragmentation lies in the range t\\ncool Ω = 1 − 10. The corresponding Σ at the transition point increases with Ω, such that outer disks are the most active regions gravitationally. Values of α up to 0.5 are possible, with the equilibrium condition prediction satisfied down to t\\ncool Ω ≈ 3 and α ≈ 0.1. Using a 3D model of a 0.07 M\\n⊙ disk with realistic cooling, Boley et al. (2006) find a value of α ∼0.01 over a large range of radii >20 AU.',\n",
       "  'In view of the limitations on α, Cesaroni et al. (2007) argue that accretion rates are limited to values substantially smaller than inferred for the formation of high-mass stars (Section 4.3.1). However, Krumholz, Klein & McKee (2007) find that disks around high-mass protostars can transfer mass inward at the same rate that it falls in. They carried out simulations of high-mass star formation in a turbulent medium and included radiative transfer rather than prescribing the heating and cooling rates. They found that large amplitude m = 1 modes develop that give effective values of α of order unity, in qualitative agreement with the isothermal disk results of Laughlin & Bodenheimer (1994).',\n",
       "  'Disks that are illuminated sufficiently strongly will have the temperature set by the external radiation field rather than internal dissipation of energy. In that case, whether self-gravity is important or not depends essentially on the amount of matter present in a given region. Where the surface density is high enough so that Q is near but not below the critical value ≈ 1.4, self-gravitational stresses will be appreciable but not so large as to cause fragmentation. Analytic estimates assuming steady state and accretion heating as well as irradiation (Matzner & Levin 2005, Rafikov 2005) indicate that fragmentation is only possible in the outer portions of disks, although more massive disks, around more massive stars, are more subject to fragmentation (Kratter & Matzner 2006). At temperatures comparable to those in observed systems, disks with masses ≳ 0.1 M\\n⊙ are candidates for having significant mass transport owing to self-gravitating torques (Mayer et al. 2004). Thus, self-gravity is likely to be particularly important during the embedded stage of disk evolution, when disk masses are the largest. Vorobyov & Basu (2005b, 2006) propose, based on results of 2D simulations, that recurrent bursts of accretion owing to self-gravity are likely to develop during the early stages of protostellar evolution. A number of other results from models of self-gravitating disk evolution (with an emphasis on criteria for planet formation through fragmentation) are presented in the review of Durisen et al. (2007).',\n",
       "  'Although a large proportion of the mass in the disk ultimately accretes onto the star, conservation of angular momentum requires that some of the matter be left behind. MHD winds during the main lifetime of the disk remove some of this material (see Section 4.2.5). What remains is either incorporated into planets or removed by photoevaporation. Although planet formation is inextricably coupled to disk evolution, recent developments in this exciting—and rapidly expanding—field are too extensive to summarize here. A number of excellent recent reviews appear in Protostars and Planets V.',\n",
       "  'Disks can be irradiated by UV and X-ray photons originating either in their own central stars or in other nearby, luminous stars (see e.g., reviews of Hollenbach, Yorke & Johnstone 2000 and Dullemond et al. 2007). Extreme UV (EUV) radiation penetrates only the surface layer of the disk, where it heats the gas to ∼104 K (the ionization and heating depth is determined by the Strömgren condition); FUV penetrates deeper into the disk (where densities are higher), but heats gas to only a few 100 K (Hollenbach et al. 1994; Johnstone, Hollenbach & Bally 1998). The characteristic radial scale in the disk for a thermally driven wind is the gravitational radius \\nrg\\n = Gm\\n\\\\* μ/(kT), where T is the temperature at the base of the flow. Pressure gradients enable flows to emerge down to (0.1 − 0.2)rg\\n (Begelman, McKee & Shields 1983; Adams et al. 2004; Font et al. 2004). EUV-driven winds are most important in the inner disk, because the gravitational potential there is too deep for FUV-heated regions at modest temperatures to escape.',\n",
       "  \"Observations discussed above (see also Simon & Prato 1995 and Wolk & Walter 1996) indicate that the inner and outer disks surrounding YSOs disperse nearly simultaneously and on a very short (∼105 years) timescale, based on the small number of transition objects between classical and weak T Tauri systems and the typical classical TTS lifetimes of a few to several million years. Because the accretion time of the outer disk itself determines the system lifetime, rapid removal of the outer disk must be accomplished by other means; photoevaporation is the most natural candidate. Models of photoevaporation that also include viscous disk evolution (which allow spreading both inward and outward) have very recently shown that rapid and near-simultaneous removal of the whole disk indeed occurs (Clarke, Gendrin & Sotomayor 2001; Alexander, Clarke & Pringle 2006a,b). In this process, the accretion rate declines slowly over time until the photoevaporative mass loss rate at some location in the inner disk exceeds the rate at which mass is supplied from larger radii. The inner disk, which is no longer resupplied from outside, then drains rapidly into the star. At the same time, the radiative flux onto the outer disk grows as it is no longer attenuated by the inner disk's atmosphere; the photoevaporation rate in the outer disk climbs dramatically, and it is removed as well.\",\n",
       "  \"Young stellar systems drive very powerful winds. The clearest observable manifestations of YSO winds are the central Herbig-Haro jets consisting of knots of ionized gas (v ≳ 100 km s−1), and the larger-scale bipolar outflows consisting of expanding lobes of molecular gas (v ∼ 10 km s−1; see \\nFigure 3\\n). Jet-like outflows (i.e., high-v, narrow molecular structures) are also observed in some circumstances (see below). The high velocities of jets indicate that they represent (a part of) the primary wind from the inner part of the star-disk system, whereas the low velocities and large masses of (broad) molecular outflows indicate that they are made of gas from the star's environment that has been accelerated by an interaction with the wind. In addition to these observed signatures, there may be significant gas in a large-scale primary wind surrounding the jet, which remains undectected owing to lower excitation conditions (low density, temperature, and/or ionization fraction).\",\n",

       "  'Outflows are ubiquitous in high-mass star formation as well as in low-mass star formation (Shepherd & Churchwell 1996). Outflows from high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs) with L < 105\\nL\\n⊙ (corresponding to m\\n\\\\* < 25 M\\n⊙—Arnett 1996) are collimated (Beuther et al. 2002b), but somewhat less so than those in low-mass protostars (Wu et al. 2004). In some cases, jets are observed with the outflows, and in these cases the momentum of the jet is generally large enough to drive the observed outflow (Shepherd 2005). No well-collimated flow has been observed in a source with L > 105\\nL\\n⊙; as remarked above, disks that are clearly circumstellar have not been observed in such sources either. Beuther & Shepherd (2005) have proposed an evolutionary sequence that is consistent with much of these data: A protostar that eventually will become an O star first passes through the HMPO stage with no HII region and with a well-collimated jet. When the star becomes sufficiently massive and close to the main sequence that it produces an HII region, the outflow becomes less collimated. The collimation systematically decreases as the star grows in mass and the HII region evolves from hypercompact to ultracompact (see Section 4.3.4). The remainder of this section focuses on winds and outflows from low-mass stars, which have been observed in much greater detail than their high-mass counterparts.',\n",
       "  'Recent reviews focusing on the observational properties of jets include those of Eisloffel et al. (2000), Reipurth & Bally (2001), and Ray et al. (2007). Jets are most commonly observed at high resolution in optical forbidden lines of O, S, and N, as well as Hα, but recent observations have also included work in the near-IR and near-UV. For CTTs, which are YSOs that are themselves optically revealed, observed optical jets are strongly collimated (aspect ratio at least 10:1, and sometimes 100:1), and in several cases extend up to distances more than a parsec from the central source (Bally, Reipurth & Davis 2007). The jets contain both individual bright knots with bow-shock morphology and more diffuse emission between these knots.',\n",
       "  'The emission diagnostics from bright knots are generally consistent with heating by shocks of a few tens of kilometers per second (Hartigan, Raymond & Hartmann 1987; Hartigan, Morse & Raymond 1994), producing postshock temperatures of Te\\n ≈ 104 K. The electron density ne\\n, ionization fraction xe\\n = ne\\n/n\\nH, and temperature Te\\n can be estimated using line ratios (Bacciotti & Eislöffel 1999).

Inferred values of \\n\\n are generally correlated with estimates of \\n\\nxs from veiling (Hartigan, Edwards & Ghandour 1995), with the ratio in the range of 0.05 − 0.1 (Ray et al. 2007).',\n",
       "  'The densities and temperatures obtained from jet diagnostics indicate internal pressures \\n\\n in the jet, exceeding the ambient pressure in the surrounding core and GMC by a factor of 102 − 104. In principle, infalling envelope gas could provide a nozzle to collimate an emerging wind, but simulations indicate that only relatively weak winds can be so confined as to produce a narrow jet (Delamarter, Frank & Hartmann 2000). This implies that observed jets must be contained within a broader wind, with collimation likely produced by magnetic hoop stresses (see below). Emission line analyses in fact indicate that a lower-velocity [∼(10 − 50) km s−1] wind component is present near the source, surrounding the high-velocity flow of a few 100 km s−1 that emerges as the large-scale jet (Hartigan, Edwards & Ghandour 1995; Hirth, Mundt & Solf 1997; Bacciotti et al. 2000; Pyo et al. 2005). Because velocities of MHD winds scale with the Keplerian rotation speed of the footpoint (see below), the presence of both high- and low-velocity components suggests that winds are driven from a range of radii in the disk. Recent high-resolution observations have detected signatures of differential rotation in jets, using near-UV, optical, and near-IR lines (Bacciotti et al. 2002, Ray et al. 2007); these also indicate a range of wind launch points.',\n",
       "  'Recent reviews of the observational properties of molecular outflows include those of Bachiller & Tafalla (1999), Richer et al. (2000), and Arce et al. (2007). Like jets, classical molecular outflows can extend to distances of 0.1 − 1 pc from the central star, but they have much lower velocities (up to a few tens of kilometers per second) and collimation (aspect ratio ∼ 3 − 10). In a few very young, embedded sources, molecular jets with much higher velocities and aspect ratios have been observed in H2, CO, and SiO lines (e.g., Gueth & Guilloteau 1999, Beuther et al. 2002a, Lee et al. 2007).

For embedded sources with L\\nbol = 1 − 105\\nL\\n⊙, the momentum flux is \\n\\n (Richer et al. 2000); in optically revealed sources, this declines considerably (e.g., Bontemps et al. 1996).',\n",
       "  'Detailed spectroscopic and morphological analysis of outflows enable intercomparisons with theoretical models. Mapping of outflows reveals both simple expanding shells and more complex features such as multiple cavities and bow shock structures that are suggestive of episodic ejection events (Lee et al. 2002); outflow lobes become broader and more irregular over time (Arce & Sargent 2006). Channel maps and position-velocity diagrams in some sources show parabolic structures that are consistent with driving by wide-angle winds and, in other sources, show spur structures that are consistent with jet driving (Lee et al. 2000, 2001). The strongly curved morphology of internal bow shocks (as seen in both molecular and atomic tracers) indicates that the wind must have velocities that decrease away from the poles, because a time-variable wind with latitudinally-constant velocity produces nearly flat internal shocks (Lee et al. 2001). This implies, in turn, that the wind is driven from a range of radii in the disk, rather than arising from only a narrow region.',\n",
       "  'It was recognized very early on that jets and outflows contain more momentum than could possibly be driven by radiation pressure (Lada 1985), whereas the high efficiencies and velocities found by Blandford & Payne (1982) for MHD winds driven from accretion disks in near-Keplerian rotation suggested that the same magnetocentrifugal mechanism could drive winds in YSO systems (Pudritz & Norman 1983). The main requirement for these winds to develop is for the disk to be threaded by magnetic fields of sufficient strength. The mathematical theory of MHD winds and jets is presented in, e.g., Spruit (1996) and Pudritz (2004).',\n",
       "  \"Over the years, two main types of MHD wind models for YSO systems have been explored. One, the x-wind model (see Shu et al. 1994 and references in Shu et al. 2000 and Shang, Li & Hirano 2007), focuses on the interaction region between the stellar magnetosphere and the inner accretion disk as the source of the wind. In this model, a large portion of the stellar dipole flux is taken to be concentrated into a small range of radii near the point where the magnetosphere and disk corotate. Because YSOs are rapid rotators the corotation point is close to the star, and the wind that would be launched could have terminal speed of a few 100 km s−1, as is observed in jets. The second class of MHD wind models assumes that a much larger region of the disk is threaded by open field lines, such that there would be a range of terminal wind speeds, reflecting the range of rotation speeds at the magnetic field's footpoints in the disk (see references in Konigl & Pudritz 2000 and Pudritz et al. 2007). For disk winds, the poloidal magnetic flux could in part be generated locally (e.g., by an MRI dynamo), in part be advected inward with the collapse of the prestellar core, and in part originate in the star and diffuse outward into the disk. Because one type of wind would not exclude the other, it is likely that both x-winds and disk winds are present at some level. This might help, for example, explain particular features of jets such as their strong central density concentration as well as the apparent decrease in velocity from inside to outside.\",\n",
       "  'The observed rotation velocities in jets can be used to infer the launch point in the disk (Anderson et al. 2003). From the Bernoulli equation for a cold flow along a streamline that rotates with angular velocity Ω\\n0\\n, the quantity \\n\\n is constant, where Φ\\ng\\n = −Gm\\n\\\\*/r is the gravitational potential and in this section R denotes the cylindrical radius. At R\\nobs, where the wind is observed (sufficiently beyond the Alfvén transition), the dominant terms in the \\n\\n equation are the first and the last terms on the right-hand side. For the cases of interest, v\\nϕ,obs ≪ v\\n\\np,obs, where vp\\n is the poloidal velocity, and \\n\\n, so that \\n\\n. The specific angular momentum \\n\\n is also conserved along streamlines. One can show that this is equal to Ω0\\nRA\\n\\n2, where RA\\n is the Alfvén radius of the wind. Because j is dominated by the kinetic term at large distance (where the wind is superfast-magnetosonic), observations can be used to infer the ratio \\n\\n. For the low velocity component of DG Tau, Anderson et al. (2003) find, from calculating Ω\\n0\\n as above, that the wind launch point radii are ∼0.3 − 4 AU, implying a disk wind. The high velocity component could originate as either an x-wind or a disk wind from smaller radii. For DG Tau, the inferred ratio RA\\n/R\\n0 ≈ 2 − 3 is also consistent with numerical solutions that have been obtained for disk winds (see Pudritz et al. 2007 for a summary). This implies that the angular momentum carried by the wind, \\n\\n, which equals the angular momentum lost by the disk, \\n\\n, can drive accretion at a rate \\n\\n.',\n",
       "  'The acceleration of MHD winds is provided by a combination of the centrifugal flinging effect produced by rigid poloidal fields and gradients in the toroidal magnetic pressure in the poloidal direction (e.g., Spruit (1996)). Beyond the Alfvén surface, magnetic hoop stresses will tend to bend streamlines toward the poles. Full cylindrical streamline collimation, in the sense of \\n\\n asymptotically, can only occur if B\\nϕ\\nR is finite for R → ∞ (Heyvaerts & Norman 1989). Using solutions in which all velocities scale as v, vA\\n ∝ r\\n-1/2 and the density and magnetic field, respectively, scale as ρ ∝ r\\n-q and B ∝ r\\n−(1 + q)/2, Ostriker (1997) showed, however, that cylindrically collimated disk winds are slow, in the sense that the asymptotic value of vp\\n/Ω0\\nR\\n0 is at most a few tenths. Because observed jets are fast, they must either have their streamlines collimated by a slower external wind or else be collimated primarily in density rather than velocity. Time-dependent simulations have also shown that the degree of collimation in the flow depends on the distribution of magnetic flux in the disk; cases with steeper distributions of B with R tend to be less collimated in terms of streamline shapes (Fendt 2006; Pudritz, Rogers & Ouyed 2006).',\n",
       "  'The idea that nearly radially flowing wide-angle MHD winds may produce a jetlike core, with density stratified on cylinders, was first introduced by Shu et al. (1995) in the context of x-winds. This effect holds more generally, however, as can be seen both analytically (Matzner & McKee 1999) and in simulations (see below). Asymptotically, the density approaches ρ → |B\\nϕ| Rk/(Ω0\\nR\\n2), where k is the (conserved) mass flux-to-magnetic flux ratio (also termed the mass-loading parameter). Because nearly radially flowing winds must be nearly force-free, |B\\nϕ|R varies weakly with R, such that if the range of k/Ω0 over footpoints is smaller than the range of R over which the solution applies (which is generally very large), the wind density will vary as r\\n-R. The r\\n-R dependence cannot continue to the origin; Matzner & McKee (1999) suggested that precession, internal shocks due to fluctuating wind velocity, or magnetic instabilities would result in a flattening of the density close to the axis so that the momentum flux in the wind \\n\\n, where θ is the angle of the flow relative to the axis and θ0 ≪ 1 measures the size of the flattened region. This distribution gives approximately equal amounts of momentum in each logarithmic interval of angle for θ > θ0. Several time-dependent numerical MHD simulations have demonstrated this density collimation effect for wide-angle winds (Gardiner, Frank & Hartmann 2003; Krasnopolsky, Li & Blandford 2003; Anderson et al. 2005).',\n",
       "  'Magnetized winds are subject to a variety of instabilities (e.g., Kim & Ostriker 2000, Hardee 2004), which may contribute to enhancing the confinement of the jet, structuring the jet column (yielding wanders, twists, and clumps), and mixing with the ambient medium at interfaces. Because jets are likely surrounded by wider winds, they are to some extent protected from the development of Kelvin-Helmholtz and helical modes that that disrupt jets propagating through ambient gas, although development of axisymmetric pinch modes may still contribute to the formation of HH knots (Hardee & Rosen 2002). In addition, lightly loaded poloidal flux within the central core of the wind/jet may help suppress the growth of large-scale pinch and kink instabilities (Ostriker & Shu 1995, Anderson et al. 2006). Time-dependent simulations focusing on the portion of the wind flow above the disk show that while steady winds are possible in certain ranges of the mass-loading parameter for a given distribution of magnetic flux, in other ranges no steady solution is possible (Ouyed & Pudritz 1999, Anderson et al. 2005). Because the spectral diagnostics of HH objects indicate shock speeds of a few tens of kilometers per second, it is plausible that they form due to nonlinear steepening and shocking of wind instabilities.',\n",
       "  'Overall, the structure and kinematics of molecular outflows suggest that they are driven by winds that originate from a range of radii in the disk, with a dense central core (seen as a jet) surrounded by a lower density, lower velocity wide-angle wind. Jet driving and wind driving of outflows have traditionally been explored separately, although in practice they would operate in tandem.',\n",
       "  'Jets drive outflows as bow shocks, with ambient material swept into a thin shell and carried away from the body of the jet as the shock overtakes and entrains it (Raga & Cabrit 1993, Masson & Chernin 1993), mixing newly shocked material with material that is already flowing outward (Smith, Suttner & Yorke 1997). The leading bow shock is itself created owing to pressure forces at the circumferential boundary of the working surface at the head of the jet, which drive transverse flows. Jets with internal shocks can create analogous bow shocks, with the difference that internal bow shocks would propagate into the wind that surrounds the jet, whereas the leading bow shock would propagate into the ambient medium. Leading bow shocks tend to be fairly narrow, because the cooling of shocked gas in the working surface limits the transverse thrust that can be applied to the shell (Downes & Ray 1999). As a consequence, the width of the shell increases only as the cube root of the distance from the head of the jet (Masson & Chernin 1993, Ostriker et al. 2001). Thus, bow shocks have difficulty explaining broad outflows. However, the convex spur velocity features seen in some systems agree well with the predictions of bow shock models (Lee et al. 2001, Ostriker et al. 2001).',\n",
       "  'For wide-angle winds, the momentum flux contained in the transverse bulk motion of the wind is large compared to the thrust that could be provided by pressure forces in the shell of shocked (strongly cooling) gas, so that a momentum-conserving “snowplow” flow is a good approximation. Shu et al. (1991) developed the “wind-swept shell” model of outflows based on this concept, which was able to explain the large opening angles seen in most outflows. Li & Shu (1996) and Matzner & McKee (1999) extended the wind-swept shell analytic model to incorporate the characteristic r\\n-R density stratification and logarithmic collimation of streamlines of asymptotic wide-angle MHD winds, as well as allow for latitudinal density stratification in the surrounding core. The mass-velocity and position-velocity relations for these analytic models agree well with those in observed outflows.

The correspondence between the CMF and the IMF has been discussed in Section 3.3; they are related by the core star-formation efficiency, εcore ≡ m\\n\\\\*/M\\ncore. (The individual-star IMF must also take into account the multiplicity of the stars formed in a given core.) Nakano, Hasegawa & Norman (1995) showed that outflows from protostars could reverse the infall and determine εcore; they assumed spherical winds and found εcore ∼ a few percent. Matzner & McKee (2000) calculated the dynamics of the outflows including collimation and obtained εcore ∼ 0.25 − 0.75, depending on the degree of flattening of the core owing to magnetic support. Subsequent observations suggest εcore ≃ 1/5 −1/3 (Section 3.3.1), at the low end of this range. They also evaluated the star-formation efficiency for a star-forming clump and found typical values somewhat less than 0.5. The predicted values of ε are inversely proportional to the momentum per unit mass in the outflow, pw\\n/m\\n\\\\*; they are consistent with observation for pw\\n/m\\n\\\\* ∼ 40 km s−1 as assumed, but not if pw\\n/m\\n\\\\* is much smaller (see Section 3.2.2 for a discussion of the values of pw\\n inferred from observation).

       "  'High-mass protostars are characterized by Kelvin-Helmholtz times that are smaller than the accretion time, so that they undergo nuclear burning while still accreting (Section 4.1). This leads to two powerful feedback effects that do not apply to low-mass protostars—radiation pressure and photoionization (Larson & Starrfield 1971). Furthermore, high-mass protostars tend to form in dense clusters, so that interaction with other protostars and newly formed stars may be important in their evolution. Drawing on the review by Beuther et al. (2007), we first summarize work on infall onto high-mass protostars and then discuss the feedback effects.',\n",

As discussed in Section 4.1, there may be a numerical factor of a few in front of the c\\n3\\neff/G. Wolfire & Cassinelli (1987) found that accretion rates of order 10−3\\nM\\n⊙ year−1 are needed to overcome the effects of radiation pressure for the highest stellar masses, and attributed this to the high values of c\\neff in high-mass star-forming regions. Myers & Fuller (1992) used their thermal/nonthermal model (Section 2.2) to infer formation times for (10 − 30) M\\n⊙ stars of (6 − 10) × 105 years; the turbulent envelopes allow equilibrium cores to have greater densities and shorter collapse times than those supported by thermal pressure alone. Caselli & Myers (1995) extended this to more massive stars and found formation times >106 years for stars of 100 M\\n⊙, a significant fraction of the main sequence lifetime. However, by modeling the SEDs of high-mass protostars, Osorio, Lizano & D’Alessio (1999) inferred that high-mass stars form in somewhat less than 105 years and favored a logatropic model for the density distribution of the core. Nakano et al.

       "  'The turbulent core model for high-mass star formation (McKee & Tan 2002, 2003) follows from the assumption that such stars form in turbulent, gravitationally bound cores (virial parameter αvir ∼ 1). The turbulence is self-similar on all scales above the Bonnor-Ebert scale, where thermal pressure dominates. The star-forming clump and the protostellar cores within it are assumed to be centrally concentrated so that the pressure and density have a power-law dependence on radius, P ∝ r\\n−kP\\n\\n, ρ ∝ r\\n−kρ. It follows that the cores are polytropes (Section 2.2), and because the Bonnor-Ebert scale is small, the cores are approximately singular. The protostellar infall rate is determined by the surface density of the protostellar core, which in turn is comparable to that of the clump in which it is embedded. The regions of high-mass star formation studied by Plume et al. (1997) have surface densities Σcl ∼ 1 g cm−3, corresponding to visual extinctions AV\\n ∼ 200 mag; these values are similar to those for observed star clusters in the Galaxy (e.g., ∼0.2 g cm−2 in the Orion Nebula Cluster, 0.8 g cm−2 for the median globular cluster and ∼ 4 g cm−2 in the Arches Cluster).

This infall rate is large enough to overcome the effects of radiation pressure at the dust destruction front, thereby addressing one of the key theoretical difficulties for models of high-mass star formation (see below). The mean infall rate could be somewhat larger than given in Equation 52 if the core was initially overdense or contracting, and turbulence in the core could generate large fluctuations in the infall rate. However, the infall rate given above is only a few times greater than the free-fall value and is unlikely to be much larger.',\n",
       "  'The key assumptions in this model are that stars form from preassembled cores (although because the cores are turbulent, there will be significant mass exchange with the ambient medium); that the cores and the clumps in which they are embedded are in approximate virial equilibrium; and that they are magnetically supercritical, so that the magnetic field does not significantly limit the rate of accretion. Evidence in support of the first assumption has been obtained by Beuther, Sridharan & Saito (2005) and Sridharan et al. (2005); the remaining assumptions are also subject to observational test. The model is necessarily approximate, as it treats the turbulence as a local pressure (the microturbulent approximation), and because it incorporates all the feedback effects owing to radiation pressure and photoevaporation in the core star-formation efficiency, εcore, which was assumed to be of order 1/2. Some of the large density fluctuations in the supersonically turbulent cores will form low-mass stars, but most of the mass of the core is assumed to go into one or two massive stars. Dobbs, Bonnell & Clark (2005) have criticized the model on the ground that the massive cores would fragment and form many low-mass stars rather than a single massive star, but radiative heating by the rapidly accreting high-mass protostar strongly suppresses fragmentation (Krumholz 2006; Krumholz, Klein & McKee 2007). The turbulent core model is consistent with the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3), and it naturally allows for the disks and winds associated with high-mass stars (see Section 4.2) because it is an extrapolation of low-mass star-formation theory. The cores are predicted to be denser than the clump in which they are embedded by about (M\\nclump/M\\ncore)1/2, which is much greater than unity for stellar mass cores embedded in clumps with M > 103\\nM\\n⊙; this naturally overcomes the crowding problem.',\n",
       "  'An alternative class of gravitational collapse models involves rapidly accelerating accretion (\\n\\n with q > 1, so that m\\n\\\\* → ∞ in a finite time in the absence of other effects). Building on the work of Norberg & Maeder (2000), Behrend & Maeder (2001) assumed that the accretion rates are proportional to the mass outflow rates observed in protostellar outflows; because the outflows are swept-up material, the justification for this assumption is unclear. They found t\\n\\\\*f\\n ∼ 3 × 105 years for massive stars, with most of the growth occurring in the last 10% of this time. In the competitive accretion model (Bonnell et al. 1997; see Section 4.1.2), massive stars form via Bondi-Hoyle accretion (\\n\\n). Keto (2002, 2003) has studied this model further, focusing on the associated HII regions. For a 10-M\\n⊙ star in a typical high-mass star-forming clump observed by Plume et al. (1997), which has a mass ∼4000 M\\n⊙ and a virial parameter of order unity, the BH accretion rate is much smaller than that expected in the turbulent core model (McKee & Tan 2003), even after allowing for the turbulent enhancement factor ϕBH (Equation 47). The rate of BH accretion increases if the virial parameter is small, if the infall occurs onto a cluster of stars that is much more massive than a single star (as Keto comments), or if the infall occurs from a significantly less massive clump. In the latter two cases the assumptions underlying BH accretion begin to break down, and further study is needed to determine the infall rate. Edgar & Clarke (2004) have shown that radiation pressure halts BH accretion when the star is moving supersonically relative to the gas for m\\n\\\\* > 10 M\\n⊙, because the luminosity is large enough that radiation pressure deflects gas away from the star.',\n",
       "  'In view of the challenges facing conventional theories of high-mass star formation, Bonnell, Bate & Zinnecker (1998) made the radical suggestion that high-mass stars form via stellar collisions. This model requires stellar densities of ∼108 stars pc−3 during the brief period in which the stars grow by merging. This coalescence model produces an IMF that is in qualitative agreement with observations, although no feedback effects were included in the calculations (Bonnell et al. 2001b). This model faces a number of challenges: (a) The required stellar density is far greater than has been observed in any Galactic star cluster. For example, W3 IRS5 is one of the densest clusters observed to date, with five proto OB stars in a sphere of radius 0.015 pc (Megeath, Wilson & Corbin 2005); the corresponding stellar density ∼4 × 105 pc−3 is lower than required by the coalescence model by more than two orders of magnitude, although it must be borne in mind that the number of lower mass stars in that volume is currently unknown. (b) For large OB protoclusters, the hypothesized ultradense state would produce a very luminous, compact source, yet this has never been observed. (c) The mass loss that is hypothesized to reduce the cluster density to observed values must be finely tuned in order to leave the cluster marginally bound. (d) Finally, it is difficult to see how the model could account for the observed disks and outflows discussed above. Bally & Zinnecker (2005) discuss a number of observational tests of the coalescence model, and suggest that the wide-angle outflow from OMC-1 in the Orion molecular cloud could be due to the merger of two protostars that released 1048 − 1049 erg. Two variants of the coalescence model have been suggested: Stahler, Palla & Ho (2000) proposed that gas bound to the protostars could increase the cross section for collisions, although they did not explain why this would result in stellar coalescence rather than the formation of a binary. Bonnell & Bate (2005) have proposed an explanation for this: assuming that the gas has negligible angular momentum (which is plausible if the turbulence is weak, as assumed in the competitive accretion model), then accretion drives the stars in the binary to closer separations and ultimately to a merger. The stellar density required for the binary coalescence model is ∼ 3 × 106 stars pc−3, substantially smaller than in the direct coalescence model but higher than observed nonetheless. However, Krumholz & Thompson (2006) argue that pre-main-sequence evolution of tight, high-mass protostellar binaries can lead to equal-mass binaries, as often observed, rather than to mergers.',\n",

       "  'The earliest stages of high-mass star formation may occur in the Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs–Egan et al. 1998), which have properties consistent with being the dense clumps out of which clusters eventually form (Simon et al. 2006). To date, few true HMSCs have been detected—high-mass cores often appear to have some signatures of star formation. In the turbulent core model, this could be because the central densities in the cores are much greater than the mean densities (in contrast to the case for low-mass cores), and the timescale for gravitational collapse is correspondingly shorter. The lack of true HMSCs is also consistent with the competitive accretion model or the coalescence model, because in these models HMSCs do not exist. Evidence for HMSCs harboring low-/intermediate-mass protostars, or possibly relatively low-mass HMPOs, has been obtained only recently (Beuther et al. 2005, Sridharan et al. 2005). HMPOs are often (but not always) associated with hot molecular cores (HMCs), which have a rich chemistry (van der Tak 2005). HMPOs are often associated with H2O and Class II CH3OH maser emission, although the interpretation of this emission remains ambiguous. HMPOs are also associated with HII regions (see Section 4.3.4); many should have hypercompact HII regions and some should be associated with ultracompact HII regions, but most ultracompact HII regions are associated with the final stars.',\n",
       "  'Observational tests of infall models for high-mass protostars are difficult owing to their large distances (typically ≳ 2 kpc), crowding, large extinctions, and confounding effects of HII regions. Several tests are possible: if confirmed, the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3) would be consistent with the turbulent core model; the properties of disks and winds associated with HMPOs can provide important clues (Section 4.2.1); the SEDs of embedded sources provide information on the distribution of circumstellar matter on scales smaller than can be directly resolved (Osorio, Lizano & D’Alessio 1999; Chakrabarti & McKee 2005; Whitney et al. 2005); and chemical clocks can provide direct measures of the timescale for the growth of HMPOs. To this end, Doty, van Dishoeck & Tan (2006) have developed the first model for the chemical evolution of an HMPO, including the evolution of the central source, infall, and adsorption and desorption of ices from grains. They find that the timescale for the warm chemistry is set by the time it takes for matter to flow through the warm region, and that the total age of the HMPO they study (AFGL 2591) is (0.3 − 1) × 105 years.',\n",

If the accretion is via a disk, as is generally expected, then the ionizing photons can escape out of the plane of the disk, and the HII region will not be trapped (Keto & Wood 2006; Keto 2007). Disk accretion is often associated with the production of winds, and Tan & McKee (2003) have suggested that such winds confine HCHII regions: The winds clear the gas along the axis, and the ionizing radiation then illuminates the inner surfaces of the winds. If correct, this offers the possibility of a powerful diagnostic for determining the nature of disk winds associated with massive stars. van der Tak & Menten (2005) found very compact radio emission aligned with the outflows in two high-mass protostellar sources, consistent with this picture.

The mass distribution of OB associations in the Galaxy also has a power-law distribution with α ≃ 1 (McKee & Williams 1997); they inferred that the distribution extended from ∼ 50 M\\n⊙ to 2 × 105\\nM\\n⊙ and could account for all the stars formed in the Galaxy. Kennicutt, Edgar & Hodge (1989) found that the luminosity distribution of HII regions in disk galaxies obeys \\n\\n, which is consistent with an r\\n-M distribution because the luminosity is proportional to mass for associations that are large enough to fully sample the IMF. The distribution of OB associations in the SMC has α = 1 from the largest associations down to associations with a single OB star (Oey, King & Parker 2004). The star clusters in the “Antennae” galaxies show α = 1 over the mass range 104\\nM\\n⊙ < M < 106\\nM\\n⊙\\n (Zhang & Fall 1999); this is one of the best determined cluster mass functions, and has an error, including systematic errors, estimated at ± 0.1.

       "  'The structure of star clusters contains clues to their formation. High-mass stars in Galactic clusters that are massive enough to contain a number of such stars are observed to be segregated toward the center of the cluster. Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998) analyzed the spatial distribution of stars in the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) and concluded that the high-mass stars were born preferentially near the center. Using N-body simulations, Bonnell & Davies (1998) showed that it takes a relaxation time, \\n\\n for \\n\\n), for high-mass stars to collect near the center of a cluster due to dynamical interactions. In the case of the ONC, they argued that significant dynamical mass segregation has occurred, but not enough to account for the observed central concentration of OB stars; they concluded therefore that the observed mass segregation is primordial. Tan, Krumholz & McKee (2006) suggested both a greater age and a longer crossing time for the ONC, but the basic conclusion does not change. In NGC 3603, the most luminous Galactic star cluster that is not heavily obscured, Stolte et al. (2006) found that the maximum mass of the stars decreases away from the center of the cluster, with all the most massive stars being quite close to the center, and again concluded that the segregation is primordial. These arguments for primordial mass segregation have been weakened by the realization that subclustering in the initial cluster significantly accelerates the rate of dynamical mass segregation (McMillan, Vesperini & Portegies Zwart 2007). In addition, most estimates do not account for dynamical friction between the stars and the surrounding gas, which can considerably reduce the mass segregation timescale (Ostriker 1999). However, recent observations have reinforced the argument for primordial mass segregation: Megeath, Wilson & Corbin (2005) have found a Trapezium-like cluster in W3 IRS5 that is deeply embedded in molecular gas and is only half the radius of the ONC. In ρ Oph, Stanke et al. (2006) found direct evidence for primordial mass segregation by showing that the CMF exhibits mass segregation as well; this also supports the correspondence between the CMF and the IMF discussed in Section 3.3. The large fraction of O stars that are runaways can be naturally explained if they originate in dense, mass-segregated clusters and undergo dynamical interactions (Clarke & Pringle 1992). The cluster R136 in the LMC appears to be an exception to the rule that high-mass stars are centrally concentrated, because half the massive stars are located outside the central core (Stolte et al. 2006).',\n",
       "  'Only a small fraction of clusters survive as bound clusters to an age of 108 years—Lada & Lada (2003) estimate this fraction as 4 = 7%. In order for a cluster to remain bound, its natal clump must have a high star-formation efficiency. Analytic estimates suggest that if the gas in the clump is removed suddenly, such as by an HII region, one requires εclump > 0.5 in order for the cluster to remain bound, whereas if the gas is removed gradually, the cluster will expand adiabatically and lower values suffice (Hills 1980; Mathieu 1983). Numerical calculations show that a fraction of the cluster survives even if the mass ejection is abrupt (Lada, Margulis & Dearborn 1984). Kroupa, Aarseth & Hurley (2001) modeled the evolution of the ONC with εclump = 0.3 and a sudden mass ejection; they concluded that 30% of the mass of the ONC would remain bound and that it would evolve into a cluster like the Pleiades. Star-formation efficiencies in the embedded clusters in the Solar Neighborhood are observed to be ≃0.1 − 0.3 (Lada & Lada 2003); because star formation is ongoing in these clusters, the final value of the star-formation efficiency, εclump, is near the upper limit of this range. Matzner & McKee (2000) calculated the star-formation efficiency for clumps in which the mass loss is dominated by protostellar outflows (\\nM ≲ 1 − 3 × 103\\nM\\n⊙\\n). (Note that the clump star-formation efficiency, εclump, which is the fraction of the mass of a clump that goes into a cluster of stars, is distinct from the core star-formation efficiency, εcore, which is the fraction of a core mass that goes into a single or binary star.) They estimated εclump ≃ 0.4 for clumps with escape velocities v\\nesc ≃ 2 km s−1, comparable to the observed value. The star-formation efficiency is predicted to rise with v\\nesc—i.e., with increasing mass and/or density of the clump.',\n",
       "  'The star-formation efficiency for larger clusters, ranging up to globular clusters and super star clusters (SSCs; e.g., Ho & Filippenko 1996) is most likely determined by the HII regions that form in the clusters. Because globular clusters are much more centrally concentrated than open clusters that form in the disk of the Galaxy today, it is likely that their star-formation efficiency, εclump, was higher. (Note that a high star-formation efficiency over the life of the clump, εclump, is consistent with a low value of the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time, εff,clump, only if clusters form over a number of free-fall times, and conversely, cluster formation in 1–2 dynamical times requires a relatively high value of εff,clump—see Section 3.4.) Using a simple phenomenological model, Elmegreen & Efremov (1997) showed how εclump should increase with both the mass of the natal clump and its pressure, P ∝ Σcl\\n2. They point out that high pressures are naturally produced in merging galaxies, accounting for the large number of SSCs seen in such systems. The high surface densities of globular clusters implies that they necessarily formed in high pressure environments (see also McKee & Tan 2003). High star-formation efficiencies are possible in a clump with embedded HII regions because their destructive effect is significantly reduced in a clump composed of dense cores (Tan & McKee 2001, Dale et al. 2005). For sufficiently massive and concentrated clusters, the escape velocity exceeds the sound speed of ionized gas, and this can further increase the star-formation efficiency (Kroupa & Boily 2002, Matzner 2002, Tan & McKee 2004).',\n",
       "  'How do stars form in clusters? The natal clumps of embedded clusters in the Solar Neighborhood have densities ∼104 − 5 cm−3 and masses ∼102 − 3\\nM\\n⊙ (Lada & Lada 2003), and more broadly distributed high-mass star-forming clumps in the Galaxy have densities ∼105 cm−3 and masses ∼103.5\\nM\\n⊙ (Plume et al. 1997). These extreme conditions have led to suggestions that the process of high-mass star formation is qualitatively different from that observed in regions of low-mass star formation (Section 4.3.1) or that it is triggered by an external effect. In a review of triggered star formation, Elmegreen (1992) pointed out that triggering generally does not affect the star-formation efficiency by more than a factor of two. In any case, triggered star formation loses much of its meaning in a theory of star formation based on turbulence, because in most cases the triggering event is just a manifestation of the intermittency of the turbulence. The observed correspondence between the CMF and the IMF (Section 3.3) and the constancy of the star-formation efficiency per free-fall time (Section 3.4) suggest a more unified picture in which stars form via gravitational collapse in a turbulent medium over most, if not all, the range of observed clustering.',\n",
       "  'Key goals of a theory of star formation are to predict the rate of star formation and the distribution of stellar masses on the macroscopic scale, and to predict the properties of individual stars from the initial conditions on the microscopic scale. In the past decade, there has been a paradigm shift in the theory from star formation in a quasi-static medium to star formation that occurs in a supersonically turbulent one, and this has led to significant progress on both fronts. Based on our current understanding, the narrative of star formation contains the following elements:',\n",

       "   'paragraph': 'In practice, observations of IR-luminous galaxies detected at high redshift with both Spitzer and Herschel have demonstrated that the IR SEDs for many galaxies are well behaved and that variations can be understood at least in part. Several pre-Herschel studies (Daddi et al. 2007; Papovich et al. 2007; Magnelli et al. 2009, 2011) compared 24-μm observations of distant galaxies with those of other SFR tracers, including Spitzer FIR measurements (either individual detections or stacked averages) and radio emission. On average, the MIR to FIR flux ratios for galaxies at z≲1.3 match those predicted by local IR SED templates such as those of Chary & Elbaz (2001), implying that 24-μm-derived SFRs should be reliable. However, at higher redshift, 1.31011\\nL\\n⊙ and >1012\\nL\\n⊙, respectively) are merger-driven starbursts, but at z≈2 where the SFRs and sSFRs of galaxies are globally much larger, the majority of LIRGs and ULIRGs are “normal” main-sequence galaxies. Their IR SEDs are more similar to those of ordinary, local star-forming spiral galaxies and have smaller bolometric corrections from observed 24-μm data (rest frame λ ≈8 μm) than those predicted by SED templates designed to match local LIRGs and ULIRGs. Elbaz et al. (2011) constructed a “universal” main-sequence SED from the ensemble of high-z Spitzer and Herschel photometry for galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields at 0.3<z<2.5. This SED leads to consistent total IR luminosities for the large majority of galaxies over that redshift range. Although no single template can be used to accurately derive L\\nIR or SFR from MIR observations for all galaxies, we now have a better understanding of how this can be done on average, which may be sufficient for deriving the global redshift evolution of the IR luminosity density or its corresponding SFRD. Rodighiero et al. (2011) (see also Sargent et al. 2012) showed that starbursts (whose IR SEDs deviate significantly from those of the main-sequence population) account for only 10% of the global SFRD at z≈2. With the data now available from Herschel and Spitzer, a broad understanding of the evolving IRLF and IR luminosity density, at least at 0<z<2.5, seems within reach.',\n",

       "   'paragraph': 'Clearly, a robust determination of dust attenuation is essential to transform FUV luminosity densities into total SFRDs. \\nFigure 8\\n shows measurements of the effective dust extinction, 〈kd\\n〉, as a function of redshift. This is the multiplicative factor needed to correct the observed FUV luminosity density to the intrinsic value before extinction or, equivalently, 〈kd\\n〉=ρIR/ρFUV+1 (e.g., Meurer et al. 1999). For most of the data shown in \\nFigure 8\\n, the attenuation has been estimated from the UV spectral slopes of star-forming galaxies using the attenuation-reddening relations from Meurer et al. (1999) or Calzetti et al. (2000) or occasionally from stellar population model fitting to the full UV-optical SEDs of galaxies integrated over the observed population (e.g., Salim et al. 2007, Cucciati et al. 2012). Robotham & Driver (2011) used the empirical attenuation correction of Driver et al. (2008). We note that the estimates of UV attenuation in the local Universe span a broad range, suggesting that more work needs to be done to firmly pin down this quantity (and perhaps implying that we should be cautious about the estimates at higher redshift). Several studies of UV-selected galaxies at z⩾2 (Reddy & Steidel 2009, Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012b) have noted strong trends for less luminous galaxies as having bluer UV spectral slopes and, hence, lower inferred dust attenuation. Because the faint-end slope of the far-UV luminosity function (FUVLF) is so steep at high redshift, a large fraction of the reddened FUV luminosity density is emitted by galaxies much fainter than L∗; this extinction-luminosity trend also implies that the net extinction for the entire population will be a function of the faint integration limit for the sample. In \\nFigure 8\\n, the points from Reddy & Steidel (2009) (at z = 2.3 and 3.05) and from Bouwens et al. (2012a) (at 2.5⩽z⩽7) are shown for two faint-end integration limits: These are roughly down to the observed faint limit of the data, M\\nFUV<−17.5 to −17.7 for the different redshift subsamples and extrapolated to L\\nFUV=0. The net attenuation for the brighter limit, which more closely represents the sample of galaxies actually observed in the study, is significantly larger than for the extrapolation—nearly two times larger for the Reddy & Steidel (2009) samples and by a lesser factor for the more distant objects from Bouwens et al. (2012a). In our analysis of the SFRDs, we have adopted the mean extinction factors inferred by each survey to correct the corresponding FUV luminosity densities.',\n",

(Shocks in compressible flows represent a different class of intermittent structures.) Signatures of intermittency are particularly evident in departures of high-order structure function exponents from the value p/3, and in non-Gaussian tails of velocity-increment probability distribution functions (PDFs) (e.g., Lis et al. 1996, Sreenivasan & Antonia 1997). Proposed methods to account for intermittency in predicting correlation functions for incompressible, unmagnetized turbulence have been discussed by She & Leveque (1994) and Dubrulle (1994). Boldyrev (2002) proposed an adaptation of this framework for the compressible MHD case, but omitted direct dissipation of large-scale modes in shocks. Research on formal turbulence theory is quite active (see Elmegreen & Scalo 2004 for a review of the recent theoretical literature relevant to the ISM), although a comprehensive framework remains elusive.',\n",

       "   'paragraph': 'Recent numerical simulations under quite disparate physical regimes have reached remarkably similar conclusions for the dissipation rates of turbulence. On dimensional grounds, the specific energy dissipation rate should equal ε U\\n3/ℓ0, where E = U\\n2/2 is the total specific kinetic energy, ℓ0 is the spatial wavelength of the main energy-containing scale (comparable to the driving scale for forced turbulence; ℓ0 ≤ L), and ε is a dimensionless coefficient. For incompressible turbulence, the largest-scale (40963 zones) incompressible, unmagnetized, driven-turbulence simulations to date (Kaneda et al. 2003) yield a dimensionless dissipation coefficent ε = 0.6. For driven incompressible MHD turbulence (at 10243 resolution), the measured dimensionless dissipation rate \\n\\n also works out to be ε = 0.6 (Haugen, Brandenburg & Dobler 2004). Quite comparable results also hold for strongly compressible (U/cs\\n = 5) turbulence at a range of magnetizations v\\nA/cs\\n = 0-10; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie (1998) found that ε = 0.6 − 0.7 for simulations at resolution up to 5123 zones. For decaying compressible MHD turbulence, damping timescales are also comparable to the flow crossing time ℓ0/v(ℓ0) on the energy-containing scale (Mac Low et al. 1998; Stone, Ostriker & Gammie 1998; Mac Low 1999; Padoan & Nordlund 1999). Thus, although very different physical processes are involved in turbulence dissipation under different circumstances, the overall damping rates summed over all available channels (including shock, reconnection, and shear structures) are nevertheless quite comparable.

One reason for this may arise from local kinematic substructure or any systematic streaming motion v\\nstr in the Sun's vicinity (Dehnen 2000, Siebert et al. 2011, Williams et al. 2013, Antoja et al. 2014). A local spiral arm density wave, for example, can impose kinematic fluctuations on the order of 10 km s−1 (Siebert et al. 2012). In addition, because the corotation radius of the Galactic bar may be as close as ∼2kpc inward from the Sun (Section 4.4), systematic streaming velocities may exist in the local Galactic disk due to perturbations from the bar and adjacent spiral arms. These could cause deviations of the zero-dispersion LSR orbit from the average circular velocity at R\\n0, defined as the angular rotation velocity of a “fictitious” circular orbit in the axisymmetrically averaged gravitational potential, the so-called rotational standard of rest (RSR; see Shuter 1982, Bovy et al. 2012a). Analyzing two mostly independent samples of stars from APOGEE, RAVE, and GCS, Bovy et al. (2015) modeled the disk velocity field over ∼3–4-kpc scales and found such effects, with an implied tangential LSR streaming velocity of 14±3kms−1 relative to the RSR. However, Sharma et al.

(2014), when fitting their maser velocities with a circular orbit velocity field, find no evidence for a deviation of the globally fitted V\\n⊙ from the locally determined value. Globally determined values of U\\n⊙ (Bovy et al. 2012a, Reid et al. 2014) agree well within errors with the locally determined U\\n⊙=10±1kms−1. Here, we adopt |v\\nstr|=0+15kms−1 because we cannot establish clear agreement on the magnitude of the streaming motion at the present time. Future studies are anticipated to compare the impending Gaia data with models including the central bar and spiral density waves in view of understanding both the random and streaming motions in the disk.\",\n",

       "   'paragraph': 'One constraint for the total mass of the Milky Way comes from the “timing mass” argument (Kahn & Woltjer 1959): The masses of M31 and the Galaxy must be sufficient to overcome universal expansion to explain their present-day kinematics being consistent with a head-on collision and a future merger in ∼6 Gyr (van der Marel et al 2012b). Timing mass estimates in early work (e.g., Li & White 2008) are now thought to be consistently too high. These have come down significantly owing to improved relative motions for both galaxies and a more accurate estimate of the solar reflex motion (Section 6.4). By selecting galaxy pairs in the Millennium simulations (after Li & White), van der Marel et al. (2012a) determine a (virial) timing mass of 4.9±1.6×1012 M⊙ for the mass within the virial radius of both galaxies (4.1±1.4×1012 M⊙ for r ≤r\\n200). After considering the orbit of M33 about M31, they further reduce the total timing mass to M\\nvir,timing=3.2±0.6×1012 M⊙. Modern mass estimates for M31 reveal that it is comparable with the Milky Way (van der Marel et al. 2012a) such that the timing mass provides an upper limit of M\\nvir≲1.6×1012 M⊙ for the Galaxy.',\n",

This problem appears to persist even in the latest state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, as seen in \\nFigure 4\\n, and already pointed out in the case of Illustris by Torrey et al. (2014). As discussed by Fontanot et al. (2009), several different sets of observations suggest that massive galaxies form early and rapidly, whereas low-mass galaxies form later and with a more extended timescale—the phenomenon that is often referred to as downsizing or staged galaxy formation (Noeske et al. 2007a). The overproduction of low-mass galaxies is a symptom of the failure of current models to reproduce this mass dependence in the SF histories of galaxies. Low-mass DM halos actually have earlier formation times than high-mass halos—the opposite of the trend seen in observations (Conroy & Wechsler 2009). In current simulations, the SF histories closely trace the DM mass accretion histories, thus similarly failing to reproduce the observed trend.',\n",

       "  \"The origin and evolution of galaxies are among the most intriguing and complex chapters in the formation of cosmic structure, and observations in this field have accumulated at an astonishing pace. Multiwavelength imaging surveys with the Hubble (HST) and Spitzer space telescopes and ground-based facilities, together with spectroscopic follow-up with 8-m-class telescopes, have led to the discovery of galaxies with confirmed redshifts as large as z = 7.5 (Finkelstein et al. 2013) as well as compelling photometric candidates as far back as z≈11 (Coe et al. 2013) when the Universe was only 3% of its current age. Following the seminal work of Steidel et al. (1996), color-selection criteria that are sensitive to the presence of intergalactic Hi absorption features in the spectral energy distribution (SED) of distant sources have been used to build increasingly large samples of star-forming galaxies at 2.5≲z≲9 (e.g., Madau et al. 1996, Steidel et al. 2003, Giavalisco et al. 2004a, Bouwens et al. 2011b). Infrared (IR)-optical color selection criteria efficiently isolate both actively star-forming and passively evolving galaxies at z≈2 (Franx et al. 2003, Daddi et al. 2004). Photometric redshifts have become an unavoidable tool for placing faint galaxies onto a cosmic timeline. Spitzer, Herschel, and submillimeter telescopes have revealed that dusty galaxies with star-formation rates (SFRs) of order 100M⊙ year−1 or more were abundant when the Universe was only 2–3 Gyr old (Barger et al. 1998, Daddi et al. 2005, Gruppioni et al. 2013). Deep near-infrared (NIR) observations are now commonly used to select galaxies on the basis of their optical rest-frame light and to chart the evolution of the global stellar mass density (SMD) at 0<z<3 (Dickinson et al. 2003). The Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite has quantified the UV galaxy luminosity function (LF) of galaxies in the local Universe and its evolution at z≲1. Ground-based observations and, subsequently, UV and IR data from GALEX and Spitzer have confirmed that star-formation activity was significantly higher in the past (Lilly et al. 1996, Le Floc'h et al. 2005, Schiminovich et al. 2005). In the local Universe, various galaxy properties (colors, surface mass densities, and concentrations) have been observed by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to be “bimodal” around a transitional stellar mass of 3×1010M⊙ (Kauffmann et al. 2003), showing a clear division between faint, blue, active galaxies and bright, red, passive systems. The number and total stellar mass of blue galaxies appear to have remained nearly constant since z∼1, whereas those of red galaxies (around L∗) have been rising (Faber et al. 2007). At redshifts 0<z<2 at least, and perhaps earlier, most star-forming galaxies are observed to obey a relatively tight “main-sequence” correlation between their SFRs and stellar masses (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority of starburst galaxies have elevated SFRs above this main sequence as well as a growing population of quiescent galaxies that fall below it.\",\n",
       "  \"With the avalanche of new data, galaxy taxonomy has been enriched by the addition of new acronyms such as LBGs, LAEs, EROs, BzKs, DRGs, DOGs, LIRGs, ULIRGs, and SMGs. Making sense of it all and fitting it together into a coherent picture remain one of astronomy's great challenges, in part because of the observational difficulty of tracking continuously transforming galaxy subpopulations across cosmic time and in part because theory provides only a partial interpretative framework. The key idea of standard cosmological scenarios is that primordial density fluctuations grow by gravitational instability driven by cold, collisionless dark matter, leading to a “bottom-up” ΛCDM (cold dark matter) scenario of structure formation (Peebles 1982). Galaxies form hierarchically: Low-mass objects (“halos”) collapse earlier and merge to form increasingly larger systems over time—from ultrafaint dwarfs to clusters of galaxies (Blumenthal et al. 1984). Ordinary matter in the Universe follows the dynamics dictated by the dark matter until radiative, hydrodynamic, and star-formation processes take over (White & Rees 1978). The “dark side” of galaxy formation can be modeled with high accuracy and has been explored in detail through N-body numerical simulations of increasing resolution and size (e.g., Davis et al. 1985; Dubinski & Carlberg 1991; Moore et al. 1999; Springel et al. 2005, 2008; Diemand et al. 2008; Stadel et al. 2009; Klypin et al. 2011). However, the same does not hold for the baryons. Several complex processes are still poorly understood, for example, baryonic dissipation inside evolving CDM halos, the transformation of cold gas into stars, the formation of disks and spheroids, the chemical enrichment of gaseous material on galactic and intergalactic scales, and the role played by “feedback” [the effect of the energy input from stars, supernovae (SNe), and massive black holes on their environment] in regulating star formation and generating galactic outflows. The purely phenomenological treatment of complex physical processes that is at the core of semianalytic schemes of galaxy formation (e.g., White & Frenk 1991, Kauffmann et al. 1993, Somerville & Primack 1999, Cole et al. 2000) and—at a much higher level of realism—the “subgrid modeling” of star formation and stellar feedback that must be implemented even in the more accurate cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (e.g., Katz et al. 1996, Yepes et al. 1997, Navarro & Steinmetz 2000, Springel & Hernquist 2003, Keres et al. 2005, Ocvirk et al. 2008, Governato et al. 2010, Guedes et al. 2011, Hopkins et al. 2012, Kuhlen et al. 2012, Zemp et al. 2012, Agertz et al. 2013) are sensitive to poorly determined parameters and suffer from various degeneracies, a weakness that has traditionally prevented robust predictions to be made in advance of specific observations.\",\n",
       "  'Ideally, an in-depth understanding of galaxy evolution would encompass the full sequence of events that led from the formation of the first stars after the end of the cosmic dark ages to the present-day diversity of forms, sizes, masses, colors, luminosities, metallicities, and clustering properties of galaxies. This is a daunting task, and it is perhaps not surprising that an alternative way to look at and interpret the bewildering variety of galaxy data has become very popular in the past two decades. The method focuses on the emission properties of the galaxy population as a whole, traces the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density from the far-UV (FUV) to the far-infrared (FIR), and offers the prospect of an empirical determination of the global history of star formation and heavy element production of the Universe, independently of the complex evolutionary phases of individual galaxy subpopulations.

The above equations govern the formation, destruction, and distribution of heavy elements as they cycle through stars and are ultimately dispersed into the ISM/IGM. By treating all galaxies as a single stellar system and all baryons in the ISM/IGM as its gas reservoir, their solution enables the mean trends of galaxy populations to be calculated with the fewest number of free parameters. The equations state that, for every new mass element locked forever into long-lived stars and stellar remnants, Δρ∗, the metallicity of the ISM/IGM increases as ΔZ=yΔρ∗/ρ\\ng\\n, whereas the mass of heavy elements in the ISM/IGM changes as Δ(Zρ\\ng\\n)=(y−Z)Δρ∗.

       "  \"Fundamentally, deriving the history of star formation in galaxies involves inferring mass from light. We observe the emission from galaxies at various wavelengths, and from those measurements, we try to infer either the rates at which the galaxies are forming stars or their integrated stellar masses. \\nFigure 1\\n illustrates the sensitivity of today's premier multiwavelength surveys to the SFRs and stellar masses of galaxies at high redshift. Rest-frame UV, IR, submillimeter and radio emission, as well as nebular lines such as Hα are all used to measure SFRs and are discussed in this section. In the absence of extinction, UV measurements are more sensitive than current IR or radio data by orders of magnitude, but in practice, dust attenuation is often severe. Long-wavelength data are essential to gain a comprehensive picture of cosmic star formation but are limited by current instrumental sensitivities, although ALMA (Atacama Large Millimeter Array) enables dramatic improvements at submillimeter wavelengths that are particularly valuable at higher redshifts. NIR to mid-infrared (MIR) measurements are critical for deriving stellar masses. Their sensitivity to stellar mass depends critically on the mass-to-light ratio of the stellar population in a distant galaxy, hence on its age, SFH, and extinction. \\nFigure 1b\\n\\n illustrates two limiting cases: a maximum-M/L model defined as a passively evolving stellar population as old as the Universe and a minimum-M/L model defined as a very young, unreddened, actively star-forming galaxy. In principle, surveys should be mass-complete to the maximum-M/L limits. Much less massive galaxies with young, low-M/L stellar populations can easily be detected, but observations would miss dusty or evolved galaxies with lower masses. The HST WFC3 camera has significantly improved NIR sensitivity compared with most ground-based imaging, but it samples only optical rest-frame light at z<3. Spitzer's IRAC remains the premier resource for deriving stellar masses at higher redshifts, and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will provide a major advance.\\n\",\n",

       "  'A galaxy (or the Universe as a whole) consists of stars that span a wide range of masses, ages, and metal abundances. The light from those stars may be attenuated by dust before it emerges from the galaxy; the dust dims and generally reddens the galaxy spectrum, and the heated dust re-emits energy in the IR. A galaxy spectrum arises from a composite stellar population whose true distribution of properties is generally unknown. For nearby galaxies, resolved color-magnitude diagrams can reveal the actual distributions of stellar properties, but for most galaxies, we can observe only their integrated light and properties of the emergent spectrum (particularly broadband colors) are often degenerate to different intrinsic properties. An often-noted example is the degeneracy between age, metallicity, and dust attenuation, all of which can redden the spectrum of a galaxy. Observations at higher spectral resolution, for example, of individual spectral lines, can help to resolve some degeneracies (e.g., to constrain stellar metallicities, population ages from absorption line strengths, or reddening from emission line ratios), but never all: The inherently composite nature of stellar populations requires that we make simplifying assumptions when interpreting the light, assumptions that generally cannot be uniquely tested for individual galaxies. Examples of such assumptions include the form of the IMF, the stellar metallicity distribution, the wavelength dependence of dust attenuation, or the precise SFH of the galaxy. The hope is that these assumptions can be made as reasonably as possible, that their impact on derived masses or SFRs can be estimated, and that ultimately they may be tested or constrained by observations in various ways.',\n",
       "  'The IMF underlies the relation between mass, light, and stellar population age. It controls the ratio of hot, bright stars that dominate the light to cool, faint stars that usually dominate the mass. It regulates the luminosity and color evolution of the integrated stellar population, as stars with different masses evolve at different rates. It also affects the time evolution of the integrated stellar mass, which changes as more massive stars lose gas to the ISM via winds or detonate as SNe.',\n",
       "  'It is essentially impossible to constrain the IMF from photometric measurements of the integrated light from galaxies: The color of a galaxy does not uniquely reveal its underlying IMF, as there are too many degeneracies to permit useful constraints. Even detailed spectroscopy does not usually offer strong constraints on the IMF overall, although certain spectral features can be useful diagnostics of the number of stars in a given mass range (e.g., Leitherer et al. 1999). The most direct constraints on the IMF come from counting stars as a function of mass in resolved, nearby stellar populations, but they must be very nearby (within our Galaxy and its satellites) to detect subsolar dwarf stars that dominate the mass of a stellar system. The next-best constraints come from integrated measurements of the mass-to-light ratio for star clusters or galaxies, using kinematics (velocity dispersions or rotation curves) to derive a mass for comparison to the luminosity. However, these measurements are difficult to make for faint galaxies at high redshift and require careful modeling to account for the role of dark matter and many other effects.',\n",
       "  'For lack of better information, astronomers often assume that the IMF is universal, with the same shape at all times and in all galaxies. Although the IMF of various stellar populations within the Milky Way appears to be invariant (for a review, see Bastian et al. 2010), recent studies suggest that the low-mass IMF slope may be a function of the global galactic potential, becoming increasingly shallow (bottom light) with decreasing galaxy velocity dispersion (Conroy & van Dokkum 2012, Geha et al. 2013). It is still unknown, however, how galaxy to galaxy variations may affect the “cosmic” volume-averaged IMF as a function of redshift. In Section 5, we see how a universal IMF can provide a reasonably consistent picture of the global SFH. The exact shape of the IMF at low stellar masses is fairly unimportant for deriving relative stellar masses or SFRs for galaxies. Low-mass stars contribute most of the mass but almost none of the light and do not evolve over a Hubble time. Therefore, changing the low-mass IMF mainly rescales the mass-to-light ratio M/L and, hence, affects both stellar masses and SFRs derived from photometry to a similar degree. Changes to the intermediate- and high-mass region of the IMF, however, can have significant effects on the luminosity, color evolution, and the galaxy properties derived from photometry. It is quite common to adopt the simple power-law IMF of Salpeter (1955), truncated over a finite mass range (generally, 0.1 to 100M⊙, as adopted in this review). However, most observations show that the actual IMF turns over from the Salpeter slope at masses <1M⊙, resulting in smaller M/L ratios than those predicted by the Salpeter IMF. Some common versions of such an IMF are the broken power-law representation used by Kroupa (2001) and the log-normal turnover suggested by Chabrier (2003).',\n",
       "  'Dust extinction is another important effect that must often be assumed or inferred, rather than directly measured. The shape of the extinction law depends on the properties of the dust grains causing the extinction. For observations of a single star, photons may be absorbed by dust or scattered out of the observed sightline. However, galaxies are 3D structures with mixed and varying distributions of stars and dust. Photons may be scattered both into and out of the sightline, and the optical depth of dust along the line of sight to the observer will be different for every star in the galaxy. These effects are generally lumped together into the simplifying assumption of a net dust attenuation curve, and such relations have been derived for local galaxy samples both empirically (e.g., Calzetti et al. 2000) and using theoretical modeling (Charlot & Fall 2000). However, all galaxies are not equal, and no net attenuation law is equally appropriate for all galaxies. There can always be stars that are completely obscured behind optically thick dust such that little or none of their light emerges directly from the galaxy, except reradiated as dust emission. Although this may not be a significant factor for many galaxies, there are certainly some starburst galaxies in which huge and bolometrically dominant star-formation activity takes place in regions screened by hundreds of magnitudes of dust extinction. UV/optical measurements will never detect this light, but the star formation can be detected and measured at other wavelengths, e.g., with FIR or radio data.',\n",
       "  'To derive star formation rates or stellar masses for galaxies using stellar population synthesis models, astronomers typically assume relatively simple, parameterized SFHs. However, the SFHs of individual galaxies are unlikely to be smooth and simple; they may vary on both long and short timescales. The fact that young stars are more luminous than older stars leads to the problem of “outshining” (e.g., Papovich et al. 2001, Maraston et al. 2010)—the light from older stars can be lost in the glare of more recent star formation and contributes relatively little to the observed photometry from a galaxy, even if those stars contribute significantly to its mass. SED model fits to galaxies with recent star formation tend to be driven largely by the younger, brighter starlight and may not constrain the mass (or other properties) of older stars that may be present.',\n",
       "  'For the Universe as a whole, there is one “cosmic” IMF that represents the global average at a given time or redshift, regardless of whether the IMF varies from one galaxy to another. Similarly, there is a “cosmic” distribution of metallicities, a “cosmic” net attenuation of starlight by dust at a given wavelength, and the Universe as a whole obeys one “cosmic” SFH that, moreover, was probably relatively smooth over time—i.e., any stochasticity or “burstiness” averages out when considered for the Universe as a whole. In principle, these facts can simplify the determination of the cosmic SFH, particularly when it is derived from measurements of integrated light averaging over all galaxies. In practice, however, astronomers often derive SFRs and stellar masses for individual galaxies in their deep surveys and then sum them to derive comoving volume averages. In that case, some of the advantages of the “cosmic averaging” are reduced.',\n",
       "  'There are many ways in which to infer SFRs from observations of the integrated light from galaxies. Kennicutt (1998) and Kennicutt & Evans (2012) have presented extensive reviews of this topic, and here we recap only points that are especially relevant for measurements of the global SFH, particularly at high redshift. Virtually all observational tracers of star formation fundamentally measure the rate of massive star formation, because massive stars emit most of the energy from a young stellar population. However, different observational tracers are sensitive to different ranges of stellar masses; hence, they respond differently as a function of stellar population age. For example, Hα emission arises primarily from Hii regions photoionized by O stars with lifetimes shorter than 20 Myr, whereas the UV continuum is produced by stars with a broader mass range and with longer lifetimes. The time dependence of different indicators can complicate efforts to derive accurate SFRs for individual galaxies, especially if their SFRs may be rapidly changing (e.g., during a starburst event), but they should average out when summing over a whole population of galaxies.',\n",
       "  'Newly formed stellar populations emit radiation over a broad spectrum. For a normal IMF, low-mass stars dominate the mass integrated over the whole stellar population, but at young ages, the luminosity is dominated by UV emission from massive stars. These stars have short lifetimes, so the UV emission fades quickly. For a Salpeter IMF, the 1,500-Å luminosity from an evolving simple stellar population (SSP) (i.e., an ensemble of stars formed instantaneously and evolving together) with solar metallicity fades by a factor of 100 after 108 years and by factors of 103 to 106 after 109 years, depending on metallicity (\\nFigure 2\\n). Bolometrically, at least half of the luminous energy that an SSP produces over a 10-Gyr cosmic lifetime emerges in the first 100 Myr, mostly in the UV, making this a natural wavelength from which to infer SFRs.\\n',\n",

For solar metallicity, by an age of 107.5 years, the 1,500-Å luminosity has reached 75% of its asymptotic value, although convergence is somewhat slower at lower metallicity (\\nFigure 2\\n). For these reasons, the UV luminosity at wavelengths of ∼1,500 Å (wavelengths from 1,400 Å to 1,700 Å have been used in the literature for both local and high-redshift studies) is regarded as a good tracer of the formation rate of massive stars, provided that the timescale for significant fluctuations in the SFR is longer than a few 107 years. For shorter bursts or dips in the SFR, changes in the UV continuum flux may lag those in the SFR and smooth over such variations.',\n",
       "  'Although the 1,500-Å rest frame is readily accessible with ground-based optical observations of galaxies at redshifts z≳1.4, measurements at lower redshifts require space-based UV data (e.g., from GALEX or HST) or are limited to longer UV wavelengths. Mid-UV reference wavelengths that have been used in the literature include 2,300 Å (the approximate central wavelength of the GALEX near-UV passband) and 2,800 Å (used, e.g., by Lilly et al. 1996). The mid-UV emission from a galaxy can have a larger contribution from longer-lived, lower-mass stars, particularly at later ages, and the time evolution of the luminosity is more gradual. This is particularly true after ∼250 Myr, when the 1,500-Å luminosity of an SSP drops off sharply, whereas the 2,800-Å luminosity continues to fade at an approximately exponential rate (\\nFigure 2\\n). For a constant SFR, the UV spectral slope reddens moderately with time, as the 1,500-Å luminosity reaches a steady-state level earlier, whereas longer-lived (B and A) stars continue to build up and contribute to the 2,800-Å luminosity. This complicates the conversion from luminosity to SFR as well as any correction for dust extinction based on the UV spectral slope. Still, for young ages, both shorter and longer UV wavelengths usefully trace the SFR and have been used extensively in the literature. Moreover, longer UV wavelengths are subject to somewhat lesser dust attenuation. Wavelengths shorter than that of Lyα (1,216 Å) are rarely used to estimate SFRs, particularly at high redshift where absorption from neutral hydrogen in the IGM is strong.',\n",

Generally speaking, less-metal-rich stars produce more UV light. The amplitude of this effect is not insignificant and depends on the details of the SFH. From a Salpeter IMF and constant SFR, the range of FUV luminosity per unit SFR for stars spanning a factor of 100 in metallicity (from Z = 0.0003 to 0.03) is less than 0.24 dex, or 70%.

Similarly, \\nFigure 4\\n examines mass-to-light ratios for an SSP as a function of age in various bandpasses, comparing values for the Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs to the Salpeter IMF. Again, these ratios are fairly constant with age and have very little dependence on the bandpass. In other words, the color evolution for an SSP with Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs is very similar to that for the Salpeter IMF, showing a roughly constant offset in M/L. [The similar time dependence of M/L for the “bottom-light” Chabrier or Kroupa IMFs to that for the Salpeter IMF is something of a coincidence (or a conspiracy). The rate of luminosity evolution for an SSP depends on the logarithmic IMF slope at masses greater than 1M⊙ and is faster for the flatter x = 1.3 (Kroupa or Chabrier) than for the Salpeter value x = 1.35. However, the evolution of the recycled mass fraction is also faster for the Kroupa and Chabrier IMFs because their low-mass turnovers give them smaller mass fractions of long-lived stars. These two effects roughly cancel for x = 1.3, resulting in a time dependence for M/L that is nearly the same as that for the Salpeter IMF. For an SSP with a “bottom-light” IMF with a Salpeter slope x = 1.35, the ratio of M/L compared with that for a Salpeter IMF would decrease by ∼16% over ∼5 Gyr, and a constant IMF rescaling factor for derived stellar masses would be inappropriate.] The dependence on metallicity (not shown) is very weak.

       "  'The greatest drawback for UV measurements of star formation is the obscuring effect of dust. Extinction is strong in the UV, so even modest amounts of dust can dramatically suppress the emerging UV flux. Dust re-emits the absorbed energy in the IR, which we discuss in the next section. A reliable measurement of SFRs from UV light must either correct for the effects of dust absorption or measure the absorbed energy directly through IR emission. We will return to the relation between UV dust attenuation and IR emission in Section 3.1.3 below.',\n",
       "  \"The energy that dust absorbs from the UV is reradiated at MIR and FIR wavelengths, making IR observations another important tool for measuring SFRs. The effect of dust extinction at FIR wavelengths is generally regarded as negligible, although in the MIR extinction can still be relevant for the most deeply buried star formation and active galactic nucleus (AGN). The total IR luminosity (L\\nIR, usually defined as being integrated over the wavelength range 8–1,000 μm) is a measurement of the energy that was absorbed by dust mainly at UV wavelengths. Because most UV emission comes from star formation, the IR luminosity is often interpreted as being directly proportional to the absorbed fraction of the energy from star formation. However, active nuclei can also produce strong UV emission, often in dusty environments, and may contribute to IR emission by heating dust in the torus and clouds surrounding the AGN. Older stellar populations can also heat dust that is present in the ISM of a galaxy, contributing to the FIR emission. This is important particularly for “mature” galaxies with low current SFRs in the nearby Universe: For a galaxy such as our Milky Way, perhaps half of the FIR emission comes from dust heated by older stars, not from young star-forming regions (Lonsdale Persson & Helou 1987). However, for very actively star-forming galaxies without AGN, it is generally assumed that most of the IR emission arises from new star formation. Ideally, a galaxy's total IR luminosity would be measured by fitting a dust emission model to observations at several wavelengths, hopefully spanning the peak of dust emission. In practice, however, such multiwavelength data are often unavailable, and astronomers frequently use an SED template that is often derived from observations of local galaxies to extrapolate from a single observed flux density at some MIR or FIR wavelength, not necessarily close to the dust emission peak, to a total L\\nIR. Thus, variations in the dust emission properties from galaxy to galaxy can lead to significant uncertainties in not only this bolometric correction but also the estimation of SFRs.\",\n",
       "  'Arising from various components heated to different temperatures, the spectrum of dust emission is fairly complex. Most of the dust mass in a galaxy is usually in the form of relatively cold dust (15–60 K) that contributes strongly to the emission at FIR and submillimeter wavelengths (30–1,000 μm). Dust at several different temperatures may be present, including both colder grains in the ambient ISM and warmer grains in star-forming regions. Emission from still hotter, small-grain dust in star-forming regions, usually transiently heated by single photons and not in thermal equilibrium, can dominate the MIR continuum (λ <30 μm) and may serve as a useful SFR indicator (e.g., Calzetti et al. 2007). The MIR spectral region (3–20 μm) is both spectrally and physically complex: It has strong emission bands from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and absorption bands primarily from silicates. The strength of emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons can depend strongly on ISM metallicity and radiation field intensity (e.g., Engelbracht et al. 2005, 2008; Smith et al. 2007). Strong silicate absorption features are seen when the column density of dust and gas is particularly large toward obscured AGN and perhaps even nuclear starburst regions. AGN may contribute strong continuum emission from warm dust and can dominate over star formation at MIR wavelengths. By contrast, in the FIR, their role is less prominent.',\n",
       "  'The Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) and the Spitzer Space Telescope were the first telescopes with MIR sensitivities sufficient to detect galaxies at cosmological redshifts. In particular, Spitzer observations at 24 μm with the MIPS instrument are very sensitive and capable of detecting “normal” star-forming galaxies out to z≈2 in modest integration times. Spitzer is also very efficient for mapping large sky areas. It has a 24-μm beam size that is small enough (5.7 arcsec) to reliably identify faint galaxy counterparts to the IR emission. However, only a fraction of the total IR luminosity emerges in the MIR. As noted above, it is a complicated spectral region that leads to large and potentially quite uncertain bolometric corrections from the observed MIR flux to the total IR luminosity. At z≈2, where 24-μm observations sample rest-frame wavelengths around 8 μm, where the strongest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bands are found, spectral templates based on local galaxies span more than an order of magnitude in the ratio L\\nIR/L\\n8\\nμ\\nm (e.g., Chary & Elbaz 2001, Dale & Helou 2002, Dale et al. 2005). More information about the type of galaxy being observed is needed to choose with confidence an appropriate template to convert the observed MIR luminosity to L\\nIR or an SFR.',\n",
       "  'The FIR thermal emission is a simpler and more direct measurement of star-formation energy. Partly owing to their large beam sizes that resulted in significant confusion and blending of sources and in difficulty localizing galaxy counterparts, ISO and Spitzer offer only relatively limited FIR sensitivity for deep observations. The Herschel Space Observatory dramatically improved such observations: Its 3.5-m mirror diameter provided a point spread function FWHM (full width half maximum) small enough to minimize confusion and to identify source counterparts in observations from 70 to 250 μm. However, at the longest wavelengths of the Herschel SPIRE instrument, 350 and 500 μm, confusion becomes severe. Herschel observations can directly detect galaxies near the peak of their FIR dust emission: Dust SEDs typically peak at 60–100 μm in the rest frame, within the range of Herschel observations out to z<4. Temperature variations in galaxies lead to variations in the bolometric corrections for observations at a single wavelength, but these differences are much smaller than for MIR data, generally less then factors of 2.',\n",
       "  \"Despite Herschel's FIR sensitivity, deep Spitzer 24-μm observations, in general, still detect more high-z sources down to lower limiting IR luminosities or SFRs. At z≈2, the deepest Herschel observations only barely reach to roughly \\n\\n [the characteristic luminosity of the “knee” of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF)], leaving a large fraction of the total cosmic SFRD undetected, at least for individual sources, although stacking can be used to probe to fainter levels. Deep Spitzer 24-μm observations detect galaxies with SFRs several times lower, and many fields were surveyed to faint limiting fluxes at 24 μm during Spitzer's cryogenic lifetime. Therefore, there is still value in trying to understand and calibrate ways to measure star formation from deep MIR data, despite the large and potentially uncertain bolometric corrections.\",\n",
       "  'In practice, observations of IR-luminous galaxies detected at high redshift with both Spitzer and Herschel have demonstrated that the IR SEDs for many galaxies are well behaved and that variations can be understood at least in part. Several pre-Herschel studies (Daddi et al. 2007; Papovich et al. 2007; Magnelli et al. 2009, 2011) compared 24-μm observations of distant galaxies with those of other SFR tracers, including Spitzer FIR measurements (either individual detections or stacked averages) and radio emission. On average, the MIR to FIR flux ratios for galaxies at z≲1.3 match those predicted by local IR SED templates such as those of Chary & Elbaz (2001), implying that 24-μm-derived SFRs should be reliable. However, at higher redshift, 1.31011\\nL\\n⊙ and >1012\\nL\\n⊙, respectively) are merger-driven starbursts, but at z≈2 where the SFRs and sSFRs of galaxies are globally much larger, the majority of LIRGs and ULIRGs are “normal” main-sequence galaxies. Their IR SEDs are more similar to those of ordinary, local star-forming spiral galaxies and have smaller bolometric corrections from observed 24-μm data (rest frame λ ≈8 μm) than those predicted by SED templates designed to match local LIRGs and ULIRGs. Elbaz et al. (2011) constructed a “universal” main-sequence SED from the ensemble of high-z Spitzer and Herschel photometry for galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields at 0.3<z<2.5. This SED leads to consistent total IR luminosities for the large majority of galaxies over that redshift range. Although no single template can be used to accurately derive L\\nIR or SFR from MIR observations for all galaxies, we now have a better understanding of how this can be done on average, which may be sufficient for deriving the global redshift evolution of the IR luminosity density or its corresponding SFRD. Rodighiero et al. (2011) (see also Sargent et al. 2012) showed that starbursts (whose IR SEDs deviate significantly from those of the main-sequence population) account for only 10% of the global SFRD at z≈2. With the data now available from Herschel and Spitzer, a broad understanding of the evolving IRLF and IR luminosity density, at least at 0<z<2.5, seems within reach.',\n",
       "  'MIR and FIR observations require space-based telescopes, but at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths, observations can once again be made from the ground within certain atmospheric transmission windows. The advent of submillimeter bolometer array cameras such as SCUBA on the JCMT revolutionized the field and led to the first detections of a large population of ULIRGs at high redshift (e.g., Smail et al. 1997, Hughes et al. 1998, Barger et al. 1998). Until recently, only the most luminous high-z objects could be readily detected, but the new ALMA interferometer will improve detection sensitivities by more than an order of magnitude, albeit over small fields of view. As noted above, submillimeter observations measure emission beyond the peak of dust emission, where flux is declining steeply with wavelength in the Rayleigh-Jeans part of the SED. This leads to a negative K correction so strong that it cancels out the effects of distance: A galaxy with a given IR luminosity will have roughly constant submillimeter flux if it is observed at any redshift 1<z<10. By contrast, the bolometric corrections from the observed submillimeter wavelengths to the total IR luminosities are large and depend strongly on dust temperature. This can lead to significant uncertainties interpreting submillimeter fluxes from high-redshift sources and a bias toward detecting galaxies with the coldest dust emission.',\n",

Here, it is assumed that the IR emission is entirely due to recent star formation, but in practice, AGN and older stars can contribute to dust heating. Furthermore, if the net dust opacity to young star-forming regions in a galaxy is not large and if a significant amount of UV radiation emerges, then the SFR derived from the IR luminosity will represent only a fraction of the total. Hence, we write SFRIR in Equation 11 to indicate that this is only the dust-obscured component of the SFR. For this reason, some authors advocate summing the SFRs derived from the observed IR and UV luminosity densities, the latter uncorrected for extinction. Once again, we calibrate the conversion factor \\n\\n using the FSPS models of Conroy et al. (2009), which also incorporate dust attenuation and re-emission. We assume simple foreground-screen dust attenuation from Calzetti et al. (2000), although the details of the dust absorption model matter relatively little. The luminosity integrated from 8 to 1000 μm depends only mildly on the detailed dust emission parameters (essentially, the dust temperature distribution) for a broad range of reasonable values. Because the dust luminosity is primarily reprocessed UV emission from young star formation, the conversion factor \\n\\n also depends on the details of the SFH and on metallicity. In practice, we may expect that galaxies with substantial extinction and bolometrically dominant dust emission are unlikely to have low metallicities; here, we assume solar metallicity for our calibration.

       "  'As noted above, dust can substantially attenuate UV emission, not only compromising its utility for measuring SFRs, but also producing IR emission, which is a valuable tracer of star-formation activity. Considerable effort has been invested in understanding the physics and phenomenology of extinction in galaxies (for a review, see Calzetti 2001). In principle, the best way to account for the effect of dust attenuation is to directly measure the energy emitted at both UV and IR wavelengths, i.e., both the luminosity that escapes the galaxy directly and that which is absorbed and reradiated by dust. This provides a “bolometric” approach to measuring SFRs. In practice, however, data sensitive enough to measure FIR luminosities of high-redshift galaxies are often unavailable. Herschel greatly advanced these sorts of observations, but its sensitivity, although impressive, was sufficient to detect only galaxies with high SFRs >100M⊙ year−1, at z>2.',\n",
       "  'For star-forming galaxies with moderate extinction at z>1, optical photometry measuring rest-frame UV light is obtained much more easily than are suitably deep FIR, submillimeter, or radio data. Current observations of UV light are also typically much more sensitive to star formation than are those at other wavelengths (\\nFigure 1\\n). As a result, trying to infer SFRs from rest-frame UV observations alone is tempting, but this requires reliable estimates of dust extinction corrections. For example, Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) are a UV-selected population of star-forming high-redshift galaxies. Their selection would favor relatively low extinction, but even LBGs are quite dusty: Reddy et al. (2012) used Herschel observations to determine that, on average, 80% of the FUV emission from typical (\\n\\n) LBGs at z≈2 is absorbed by dust and reradiated in the FIR. Many more massive galaxies with high SFRs have greater extinction. So-called dust-obscured galaxies (Dey et al. 2008) have MIR to UV flux density ratios >1,000 (typically corresponding to L\\nIR/L\\nFUV>100) (Penner et al. 2012) and are quite common, contributing 5–10% of the SFRD at z≈2 (Pope et al. 2008); many of these are nearly or entirely invisible in deep optical images.',\n",
       "  'Nevertheless, the widespread availability of rest-frame UV data for high-redshift galaxies encourages their use for measuring the cosmic SFH. Presently, at z≫2, there is little alternative: Even the deepest Spitzer, Herschel, radio, or submillimeter surveys can detect only the rarest and most ultraluminous galaxies at such redshifts. By contrast, deep optical and NIR surveys have now identified samples of thousands of UV-selected star-forming galaxies out to z≈7 and beyond.',\n",
       "  \"Attempts to measure and correct for dust extinction in high-z galaxies have generally used the UV spectral slope (designated β) as a measure of UV reddening and have adopted empirical correlations between UV reddening and UV extinction. Calzetti et al. (1994, 2000) used ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy to derive an empirical, average dust attenuation curve for a sample of local UV-bright star-forming galaxies. Meurer et al. (1999) (later updated by Overzier et al. 2011) used UV and FIR data for a similar local sample to empirically calibrate the relation between UV reddening (β) and UV extinction (IRX≡L\\nIR/L\\nFUV, which can be directly related to A\\nFUV). The reasonably tight IRX-β relation obeyed by the local UV-bright galaxies is broadly consistent with the Calzetti attenuation law, hence reinforcing its popularity. However, other local studies showed clearly that some galaxies deviate from these relations. Goldader et al. (2002) found that nearby ULIRGs deviate strongly from the Meurer IRX-β relation; these ULIRGs have very large values of IRX but often with relatively blue UV spectral index β. This was interpreted to mean that the observed UV light from local ULIRGs is relatively unreddened star formation in the host galaxy that is unrelated to the bolometrically dominant star formation, which is entirely obscured from view at UV-optical wavelengths and detected only in the FIR. Instead, observations of ordinary spiral galaxies (Kong et al. 2004, Buat et al. 2005) measured redder values of β for a given IRX. This is generally taken as evidence that light from older and less massive stars contributes significantly to the near-UV emission, leading to redder UV colors for reasons unrelated to extinction. In general, different relative distributions of stars and dust can lead to different net attenuation properties. Extinction can easily be patchy: Winds from star-forming regions can blow away dust on certain timescales, whereas other regions that are younger or more deeply embedded in the galaxy's ISM remain more heavily obscured. Dust heating also depends on geometry, leading to different distributions of dust temperatures and different emission spectra at IR and submillimeter wavelengths.\",\n",
       "  'At high redshift, there are only relatively limited tests of the relation between UV reddening and extinction. Reddy & Steidel (2004) and Reddy et al. (2006, 2010, 2012) have compared various SFR tracers (including radio, Spitzer 24-μm, and Herschel 100–160-μm emission) to show that Calzetti/Meurer UV extinction laws are broadly appropriate for the majority of L∗ LBGs at z≈2. However, they found evidence for systematic deviations for galaxies with the largest SFRs (>100M⊙ year−1), which, similar to local ULIRGs, show “grayer” effective attenuation (i.e., less UV reddening for their net UV extinction). They also found evidence for systematic deviations for the youngest galaxies, which show stronger reddening for their net FUV extinction, perhaps because of the metallicity or geometric effects that steepen the wavelength dependence of the UV reddening function compared with results from the Calzetti law. Assuming Calzetti attenuation, Daddi et al. (2007) and Magdis et al. (2010) also found broad consistency between UV-based and IR- or radio-based SFR measurements for samples at z ≈ 2–3 (although, see Carilli et al. 2008). However, studies that have selected galaxies primarily on the basis of their IR emission have tended to find significant deviations from Meurer/Calzetti attenuation. In general, these deviations indicate that UV-based SFRs using Meurer/Calzetti UV slope corrections significantly underestimate total SFRs (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005, Papovich et al. 2007). Such studies have also found that differently selected populations may obey systematically different net dust attenuation relations depending on the properties of the galaxies (Buat et al. 2012, Penner et al. 2012).',\n",
       "  'Therefore, we must remain cautious about SFRs derived from UV data alone, even when estimates of UV reddening are available. Current evidence suggests that these may work well on average for UV-bright LBGs with relatively low reddening but may fail for other galaxies including the most IR-luminous objects that dominate the most rapidly star-forming galaxy population. Star formation that is obscured by too much dust, e.g., in compact starburst regions, will be unrecorded by UV observations and can be measured directly only with deep IR, submillimeter, or radio measurements.',\n",
       "  'Star formation also produces nebular line emission from excited and ionized gas in Hii regions. Recombination lines of hydrogen such as Hα and Lyα are often used to measure SFRs, because they have a close relation to photoionization rates that are mainly due to intense UV radiation from OB stars. Hence, they trace massive star formation quite directly, although the presence of AGN can also contribute to these lines. Other lines from heavier elements such as [Oii] 3,727 Å or [Oiii] 5,007 Å have been used, but they tend to have more complex dependence on ISM conditions such as metallicity or excitation. Emission lines are also subject to absorption by dust in the star-forming regions. This is particularly true for Lyα, which is a resonance line, scattered by encounters with neutral hydrogen atoms. Such encounters can greatly increase the path length of travel for Lyα and hence increase the likelihood that it may encounter a dust grain and be absorbed. Overall, Hα is regarded as the most reliable among the easily accessible nebular SFR tracers (e.g., Moustakas et al. 2006). Weaker but less extinguished hydrogen lines in the NIR, such as Paschen α, can be very useful for measuring SFRs in dusty galaxies, but they are generally accessible only at very low redshift, although the JWST will open the possibility for measuring these for significant numbers of galaxies at cosmological distances.',\n",
       "  'Radio emission is also correlated with star formation, as SN-accelerated electrons emit nonthermal radiation at centimeter wavelengths; thermal (free-free) emission from electrons in Hii regions can also contribute, particularly at higher frequencies (>5 GHz). The physics is somewhat complicated and not entirely understood, but a remarkably tight correlation is observed between radio emission and FIR emission in local galaxies spanning many orders of magnitude in luminosity (e.g., Condon 1992, Yun et al. 2001). Radio emission is free from dust extinction and thus offers a relatively unbiased tracer of star formation. However, it is difficult to obtain radio observations deep enough to detect ordinary star-forming galaxies at high redshift, although recent upgrades to the Karl G. Jansky VLA have significantly improved its sensitivity. AGN can also contribute to radio emission, occasionally dominating for radio-loud AGN (which are a minority population). Radio emission should also be suppressed at earlier cosmic epochs, as electrons should lose energy by inverse Compton scattering off microwave background photons whose energy density increases at high redshift. Recent studies have found little evidence for redshift evolution in the FIR to radio correlation (Appleton et al. 2004; Ivison et al. 2010a,b; Sargent et al. 2010a,b; Mao et al. 2011).',\n",
       "  'Even X-rays have been used to trace SFRs. X-rays are typically regarded as a quintessential signature of AGN activity in galaxies, but they are also produced by young stellar populations, notably by X-ray binaries. In the absence of an AGN, X-ray emission may be measured from individual star-forming galaxies out to z≈1 in the deepest Chandra fields, and stacking measurements have been used to reach fainter fluxes in studies of UV-selected galaxies, with detections at 1<z<4 and upper limits at higher redshifts (Reddy & Steidel 2004; Laird et al. 2005, 2006; Lehmer et al. 2005; Basu-Zych et al. 2013). However, the proportionality between X-ray luminosity and SFR may vary with stellar population age and other parameters that could affect the mix of low- and high-mass X-ray binaries present in a galaxy; various calibrations that differ significantly have been published (e.g., Ranalli et al. 2003, Persic et al. 2004). Overall, because most of the cosmic X-ray background arises from AGN (for a review, see Brandt & Hasinger 2005), the value of using X-rays to measure the cosmic SFH seems limited (we do not discuss this method further).',\n",
       "  'Whereas hot young stars emit most of their energy at UV wavelengths, the cooler low-mass stars that dominate the stellar mass of a galaxy emit most of their light at red optical and NIR wavelengths. If we examine the SED of an evolving SSP from ages older than 109 years, the bulk of the luminosity (in λf\\nλ energy units) is emitted in a broad plateau between 0.4 and 2.5 μm, peaking at ∼1 μm for ages >2 Gyr. (In f\\nν flux density or AB magnitude units, the SED peak is at approximately 1.6 μm, where there is a minimum in the H− opacity of cool stellar atmospheres.) The effects of dust extinction are also greatly reduced at NIR wavelengths: For Calzetti attenuation, the extinction (in magnitudes) A in the K-band is 10 times smaller than that in the V-band and 25 times smaller than that at 1,600 Å.',\n",
       "  'The luminosity, and hence the mass-to-light ratio, of a stellar population evolves very steeply with time at UV and blue wavelengths: Young stars evolve quickly off the main sequence but more slowly at red and NIR wavelengths. Therefore, observations in the NIR rest frame more closely trace the integrated stellar mass of a galaxy, but we cannot neglect the effects of evolution: The flux at 1 μm still changes by more than an order of magnitude as a stellar population ages from 0.1 to 10 Gyr (see, e.g., figure 9 from Bruzual & Charlot 2003). Therefore, we need to do more than simply measure the NIR luminosity to infer a stellar mass.',\n",
       "  \"In effect, astronomers use the colors or SED of a galaxy to infer the expected mass-to-light ratio at some wavelength (preferably in the red or NIR) and then multiply the observed luminosity by M/L to estimate the stellar mass (M∗). The most common method is to fit spectral templates generated by stellar population synthesis models to broadband photometry in whatever bands are available that span rest-frame UV to NIR wavelengths, where stellar photospheric emission dominates the galaxy light. Generally speaking, researchers generate a large suite of models that span a wide range of stellar population parameters, including the past SFH, age, metallicity, and dust attenuation. The IMF is typically fixed, because there is almost no photometric signature that can usefully constrain it. The suite of models is redshifted to match a galaxy of interest. The models are then convolved by the filter bandpasses to generate synthetic broadband fluxes that are fit to the photometry, allowing the luminosity normalization to vary and minimizing χ\\n2 or some other likelihood parameter. The unnormalized models have a specified unit mass; therefore, normalization of the best-fitting model provides the best estimate of the galaxy's stellar mass, given the range of input parameters that were allowed.\",\n",
       "  \"In principle, this method can be used to constrain other stellar population parameters such as the galaxy's age, SFR, or the degree of extinction that is present. In practice, the fitting results for various parameters are often quite degenerate. For example, age, extinction, and metallicity all affect the integrated colors of a galaxy. As a result, the derived values of these parameters tend to be highly covariant: A galaxy may be red because it is old, dusty, or very metal rich. With very good photometry, particularly spanning a large range of wavelength and with many bandpasses that can more accurately sample the detailed spectral shape (e.g., measuring relatively sharp age-sensitive features such as the Balmer or 4,000-Å breaks), these constraints can be improved, but it is hard to avoid significant degeneracies. Careful practitioners may consider joint probability distributions for models that fit with acceptable likelihood. The stellar mass tends to be the best-constrained parameter, largely because the degeneracies in other parameters all tend to affect the net M/L of the model in similar ways. Redder colors from age, dust, or metallicity all tend to affect M/L to a similar (but not identical) degree. Whereas parameters such as age or reddening may be individually uncertain, the net M/L of acceptable models does not vary so much. Thus, the total mass is well constrained. Many papers have discussed stellar population modeling uncertainties in estimating galaxy masses; these are thoroughly reviewed by Conroy (2013).\",\n",
       "  \"Other than the choice of the IMF, the largest uncertainty that affects the derived stellar mass is usually the necessarily imperfect knowledge of the galaxy's past SFH. Fundamentally, more recently formed stars can easily outshine older stars and dominate the observed light, even at red wavelengths. The observed photometry may be dominated by the younger starlight, even though the actual galaxy mass may be dominated by older stars that are lost in the glare of the younger stars (“outshining,” e.g., Papovich et al. 2001, Maraston et al. 2010) and thus have little impact on the choice of the best-fitting models. Therefore, the model fitting often underestimates the age of the galaxy or the potential contribution of older stars to the mass, and it may also underestimate the mass. If the actual SFH were well known (which is almost never the case in practice), this might not be a problem. For example, the models used to fit the photometry are often assumed to have smoothly varying SFRs, but the actual SFHs of real galaxies can be complex and nonmonotonic, fluctuating with time and perhaps punctuated by short-duration bursts. Even if very large suites of models with complex SFHs are considered, outshining tends to ensure that recently formed stars drive the model fitting, whereas the mass in older stars is poorly constrained. This effect generally leads to underestimation of galaxy stellar masses (Pforr et al. 2012). Realistically constraining the distribution of allowable past SFHs for real galaxies, especially at high redshift, remains a basic limitation when deriving stellar masses.\",\n",
       "  'In practice, these SFH degeneracies are largest for galaxies with recent star formation. For galaxies that have not formed stars in a long while (say >1 Gyr) or for which the current SFR is small compared with the stellar mass (often quantified by the sSFR), the outshining is small and, thus, so is the resulting systematic uncertainty on M/L. Therefore, stellar masses for present-day elliptical galaxies, which are old with little or no ongoing star formation, or for ordinary spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way tend to be reasonably well-constrained, whereas those for very actively star-forming galaxies are less certain. As an example, Papovich et al. (2001) fit models to HST WFPC2 and NICMOS photometry for faint LBGs at z≈2.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDF-N). When using models with smoothly varying SFHs, they found stellar mass uncertainties to be σ(logM∗)<0.5 dex, with typical uncertainties of 0.25 dex, i.e., less than a factor of 2. However, if they considered “maximal M/L” models, which allowed for as much older stellar mass as possible within the χ\\n2 fitting constraints formed at z=∞, the masses could in principle be as much as 3 to 8 times larger. In practice, such extreme models seem unlikely. Moreover, the early work of Papovich et al. (2001) used photometry only out to the K-band or rest-frame wavelengths ∼6,000 Å at z = 2.5. Today, deep Spitzer IRAC photometry routinely measures fluxes for high-z galaxies at redder rest-frame wavelengths and can significantly improve stellar mass constraints. Nevertheless, even with the best data from Spitzer (or the JWST in the future), the effects of outshining fundamentally limit our certainty about stellar mass estimates for individual objects. These effects can be reduced only if reasonable prior assumptions can more tightly constrain the range of allowable SFHs.',\n",
       "  'Interestingly, at very high redshifts some of these SFH uncertainties are reduced, simply because the Universe is much younger. At z>6, the Universe is less than 1 Gyr old, and the oldest stars in the galaxies must be younger than that; this sets a cap on M/L for a hypothetical unseen old population and thus on its possible contribution to the total stellar mass. Curtis-Lake et al. (2013) provided a recent and detailed discussion of stellar population modeling uncertainties for galaxies at z ∼ 6.',\n",
       "  'Additionally, the practitioners who create stellar population models have not reached complete consensus: Questions regarding evolutionary tracks, the contributions of certain stellar subpopulations, and the behavior of stellar populations at low and high metallicities remain topics of debate or are poorly calibrated by observations. One widely recognized example of such uncertainties was highlighted by Maraston (2005), whose models featured significantly greater contributions of emission from thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stars to the red and NIR rest-frame light at SSP ages between a few hundred million years and ∼2 Gyr. The enhanced red luminosity led to lower M/L at these wavelengths and redder colors, with potentially quite significant effects (factors of 2 or more) in derived stellar masses for galaxies dominated by stars in this age range. Although such populations may not dominate in most present-day galaxies, at z≈2−4 when the Universe was only a few billion years old their role must be accurately modeled to ensure proper estimates of stellar masses. Maraston et al. (2006) found that this could reduce derived stellar masses by ∼60% on average for K-band-selected star-forming galaxies at z≈2 compared with results computed using the popular models of Bruzual & Charlot (2003). Although Bruzual et al. (2013) released new models in 2007 that featured enhanced TP-AGB emission, they have argued in recent conference presentations for weaker TP-AGB emission more similar to that in the older models. Given the lack of a completely satisfactory way to compute this contribution on theoretical principles, a lot hangs on the sparseness of data available to empirically calibrate the emission and evolution of TP-AGB stars.',\n",

Much of the observational work has been carried out in deep survey fields that have accumulated outstanding multiwavelength data for this purpose and cover different angular scales to different depths (\\nFigure 6\\n). We do not attempt a comprehensive review of this literature. Instead, we highlight key data sets and analyses from roughly the first decade of cosmic SFR measurements (1996–2006) and then focus on the most important or extensive recent measurements that we use in our analysis in Section 5. Hopkins (2004) and Hopkins & Beacom (2006) provided an extensive compilation of SFRD measurements up to 2006, whereas Wilkins et al. (2008a) summarized SMD derivations through 2007.

One should thus be cautious compiling results from many different studies: Although the analyses are independent, the data used and the actual galaxies measured may not be different. For example, the SFHs of GOODS-South and COSMOS are particularly well studied, but true cosmic variance due to clustering in those fields will not cancel out from one analysis to another.',\n",
       "  'The largest number of analyses of the cosmic SFRD have used rest-frame UV continuum measurements, largely because the method is quite sensitive (see \\nFigure 1\\n) and can be applied over a very broad range of redshifts. Rest-frame FUV (1,500 Å) SFRs at 1.4<z<6 can be measured using optical photometry that is (relatively) easily obtained with ground-based or HST imaging. The heavy use of photometric redshifts in recent years has led to much work based on imaging data alone, with little or no spectroscopy. However, in popular deep survey fields such as GOODS or COSMOS, the photo-z values are typically well calibrated thanks to the widespread availability of thousands of spectroscopic measurements. At z<1, rest-frame UV measurements ideally require space-based telescopes such as GALEX or HST to reach rest-frame wavelengths near 1,500 Å, but several studies have used blue or U-band imaging to sample mid-UV wavelengths (e.g., 2,800 Å) at z<1 instead.',\n",
       "  'The modern era of SFRD measurements arguably began with the analysis of Lilly et al. (1996), who were the first to combine a large and deep (for its time) spectroscopic redshift survey with multiwavelength photometry and to derive LFs and luminosity densities at several different rest-frame wavelengths, including the rest-frame UV. The Canada-France Redshift Survey (CFRS) was carried out using the 4-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and mainly surveyed the Universe out to z<1. The available BVIK-band photometry permitted direct measurement of 2,800-Å rest-frame luminosities at z>0.5 and down to z≈0.3 with modest spectral extrapolation. Lilly et al. (1996) found that the 2,800-Å luminosity density declined by approximately one order of magnitude from z = 1 to the present, which they interpreted as a steep decline in the SFRD.',\n",
       "  '\\nMadau et al. (1996) used the then-new HDF observations to extend this analysis to much higher redshift. They employed color-selected LBG samples at 〈z〉=2.75 and 4. The deep HST WFPC2 photometry allowed luminosities to be measured at 1,500 Å in the rest frame, reaching fainter than contemporaneous ground-based LBG data at z≈3 from Steidel et al. (1996) and thus integrating further down the LF. Madau et al. (1996) quoted only lower limits for the SFRD, without extrapolation to fainter luminosities (relatively small, given the depth of the HDF imaging) and without correction for dust absorption (significant, but at the time little known). Later analyses (e.g., Sawicki et al. 1997, Madau et al. 1998b, Steidel et al. 1999) fit Schechter LFs to the photometric samples to extrapolate to total UV luminosity densities. Connolly et al. (1997) and Pascarelle et al. (1998) combined the optical HST imaging of the HDF with ground-based NIR data to improve photometric redshift analyses in the redshift “desert” at 11 and the CFRS measurements at z<1 suggested a general “rise and fall” picture of a UV luminosity density and, by inference, the cosmic SFH that peaked somewhere between z≈1 and 2.',\n",
       "  'Various surveys subsequently extended this finding using other data sets or different analyses. Several groups reanalyzed the HDF (and later the HDF-South) data in various ways or made use of deeper spectroscopic surveys with the Keck telescope. Cowie et al. (1999) and Wilson et al. (2002) combined Keck spectroscopy in several fields with deep U-band imaging to measure shorter rest-frame UV wavelengths (2,000–2,500 Å) at z<1 than were probed in the CFRS analysis of Lilly et al. (1996) and derived a shallower rate of decline in the SFRD. Wolf et al. (2005) used 17-filter intermediate and broadband imaging to obtain high-quality photometric redshifts at z<1.25 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and analyzed the 2,800-Å luminosity density evolution.',\n",

In early work, Treyer et al. (1998) and Sullivan et al. (2000) used the FOCA balloon-borne UV telescope to measure 2,000-Å luminosity densities at z≈0.15. GALEX has since provided vastly more FUV data, including both wide-area and deeper surveys. Wyder et al. (2005) combined GALEX all-sky imaging survey data with distances from the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) over 56 deg2 to measure local (z≈0.055) LFs at 1,500 Å and 2,300 Å. Budavári et al.

This remains the most direct and frequently cited GALEX study of FUV luminosity densities at z<1, which is somewhat surprising, as there are many more deep GALEX observations in fields with extensive spectroscopy (COSMOS, AEGIS, GOODS, etc.). Yet, to our knowledge, there have been no other published LFs. The Arnouts/Schiminovich analysis is admirable, but it used only ∼1,000 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts over the whole range Δz=1 in a single field covering 0.5 deg2. Hence, it may be subject to cosmic variance issues. This area is ripe for further exploitation of existing archival data.',\n",

Until recently, only one 50-arcmin2 field in GOODS-South had been surveyed to interesting depths to study distant galaxies (Hathi et al. 2010, Oesch et al. 2010). At z<1.4, where these data measure FUV rest-frame emission, the survey volume and counting statistics are poor. These data have also been used for Lyman break color selection at z≈1.5–2. The analyses generally support relatively steep UVLFs with α<−1.5 with large uncertainties. Expanded WFC3 UVIS observations in the HUDF and GOODS-North field have been recently completed and should improve the existing measurements. A recent WFC3 UVIS survey of gravitationally lensed galaxies behind the massive cluster Abell 1689 (Alavi et al. 2013) has been used for Lyman break color selection to unprecedentedly faint FUV luminosities at z≈2 to MAB\\n≈−13, or ∼1,000 times fainter than L∗ at that redshift.

They demonstrated consistency with the GALEX luminosity densities from Schiminovich et al. (2005) but did not make direct use of the GALEX data. Although the largest and deepest spectroscopic sample used to derive UVLFs at 0 < z < 2, it is based on only one sightline and requires SED extrapolation to rest frame 1,500 Å at lower redshifts. Tresse et al. (2007) presented a similar, earlier analysis using shallower spectroscopy in two VVDS fields.',\n",

Their survey covers many widely spread sightlines and provides excellent control over cosmic variance. Among several LF analyses from these data, the most recent and definitive are those of Reddy et al. (2008) and Reddy & Steidel (2009). These still rely on deep photometric color-selected samples to probe the faint end of the LF, but with a degree of spectroscopic confirmation and calibration for brighter galaxies that is unmatched by any other survey. The use of UV rest-frame selection means that any LBG-based study will miss heavily dust-obscured star formation at these redshifts, but as a measure of the evolving UV luminosity density, the LBG surveys have provided the most robust method to date.',\n",

The Subaru telescope and its SuPrime Cam imager have been particularly important in this respect, although deep IR imaging from UKIRT and the VLT has also been used. Notable examples (not an exhaustive list) include Ouchi et al. (2004), Yoshida et al. (2006), Iwata et al. (2007), and McLure et al. (2009) at z = 4 to 6 and Ouchi et al. (2009), Castellano et al.

       "  'The installation of the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) enabled substantially more efficient optical HST imaging that covers fields much wider than the original HDF. ACS also offered significant gains in sensitivity at the reddest wavelengths, making Lyman break selection practical out to z≈6. Two major ACS surveys led to new derivations of the cosmic SFRD. GOODS (Giavalisco et al. 2004b) observed two independent fields with combined area >60 times larger than the HDF through four filters. This provided a sample of several thousand Lyman break candidates at z≈4 and of order 1,000 at z≈5, reaching significantly fainter than L∗ and permitting robust characterization of the luminosity density. LBG selection at z≈6 was less secure from GOODS ACS data alone, as it was based on a single color (i−z) and could sample only relatively bright galaxies. The HUDF (Beckwith et al. 2006) observed a single ACS pointing (∼11 arcmin2) located within the GOODS-South region with very long exposure times and reaching fainter than the original HDF and with better sensitivity at higher redshifts. Both GOODS and the HUDF have been repeatedly revisited with new observations from HST over the years to add deeper optical imaging as well as NIR data, first from NICMOS (Thompson et al. 2006, Conselice et al. 2011) and later with WFC3 in the HUDF09 and HUDF12 programs (Bouwens et al. 2011b, Ellis et al. 2013) and the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) of several premier deep survey fields including GOODS (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011). These IR observations make Lyman break selection at z≈6 far more robust and extend the method out to z≈8, with a handful of unconfirmed candidates identified out to z≈12.',\n",
       "  'Early analyses of the GOODS data (Giavalisco et al. 2004a) found evidence for relatively mild evolution of the UV luminosity density from 2 < z < 5 and clear evidence that there were fewer high-luminosity galaxies at z≈6 (Stanway et al. 2003, Dickinson et al. 2004). Subsequent studies have repeatedly mined the combined GOODS+HUDF observations, using deeper data and more rigorous analyses. At least 20 papers about high-redshift LFs using WFC3 data in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS have been published since 2010, augmenting at least a dozen others pre-WFC3. We cannot attempt to review them all here, but they have convincingly demonstrated that the UVLF evolves significantly at z>4. The current consensus is that this is primarily luminosity evolution, at least at 4 < z < 7, with L∗ brightening over time (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2007, 2012b; Grazian et al. 2011). As a result, the number density of bright LBGs increases rapidly with time, more quickly than does the integrated luminosity density. Analyses using the CANDELS and HUDF09+12 NIR imaging point to continued evolution out to z = 8 and perhaps beyond (Oesch et al. 2012, Yan et al. 2012, Lorenzoni et al. 2013, Schenker et al. 2013), although it would be prudent to recall that only a handful of galaxies at z≈7 have reasonably secure spectroscopic confirmation and none at z>7.5. There is broad agreement that UV spectral slopes for LBGs are bluer at z>4 than at lower redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013), which has implications for their dust extinction and total SFRD. Most of these studies have examined the faint-end slope of the LF, measuring very steep values, in some cases approaching or exceeding the divergent value α=−2 (Bouwens et al. 2012b, McLure et al. 2013). Several studies have also extended SFRD analyses to 9 < z < 12, using data from the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011a, Ellis et al. 2013) or from lensing cluster studies (Coe et al. 2013). Although still in flux as better data accumulate, these measurements have considerable significance for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and for the reionization of the IGM (e.g., Robertson et al. 2013), but relatively little impact on the global star-formation budget of the Universe. According to current estimates, only ∼1% of the cosmic SMD present today was formed at z>6.',\n",
       "  'IRAS enabled the first measurements of the local far-infrared luminosity function (FIRLF) (Lawrence et al. 1986, Soifer et al. 1987, Saunders et al. 1990, Sanders et al. 2003). These were typically measured either at 60-μm observed wavelength or using FIR luminosities integrated over a broader wavelength range. They were also generally extrapolated from the measured IRAS fluxes using fitting formulas. Although various representations of FIR luminosity have been adopted, here we consider L\\nIR as the luminosity integrated over the range 8–1,000 μm, which encompasses most of the bolometric luminosity of dust emission from nearly all sources of interest. The longest wavelength IRAS band was at 100 μm, but AKARI extended all-sky FIR measurements out to 160 μm to provide more reliable measurements of the bolometric luminosity and reduced bias against galaxies with cold dust temperatures. Goto et al. (2011a,b) reanalyzed the local IRLF incorporating AKARI data. Despite differences in detail, the results are largely consistent with previous IRAS measurements in the luminosity range of overlap. LFs have also been measured for IRAS samples selected at 12 and 25 μm (Rush et al. 1993, Shupe et al. 1998). LFs at longer IR wavelengths were measured for (rather small) local samples with ISO [90 μm (Serjeant et al. 2004); 170 μm (Takeuchi et al. 2006)], Herschel (250–500 μm) (Dey et al. 2010, Vaccari et al. 2010), and with ground-based (sub)millimeter observations generally for IRAS-selected samples [1.2 mm (Franceschini et al. 1998); 850 μm (Dunne et al. 2000)]. New, large-area measurements using the largest Herschel surveys (e.g., H-ATLAS, covering 550 deg2 with observations from 100 to 500 μm) have not yet appeared in the literature.',\n",
       "  'Nearly all studies found that the bright end of the IRLF cuts off less sharply than does the exponential used in the Schechter function. This has typically been modeled either as a double power law (e.g., Lawrence et al. 1986, Sanders et al. 2003) or as a combined log-normal and power law (e.g., Saunders et al. 1990). Locally, the bright end of the IRLF is dominated by galaxies with warmer dust temperatures, which tend to be starburst galaxies and dusty AGN (Saunders et al. 1990). Several studies have measured a steep faint-end slope α (dN/dL∝L\\nα), e.g., α=−1.6 (Sanders et al. 2003), α=−1.8 (Goto et al. 2011a), and α=−1.99 (Goto et al. 2011b). However, other studies have found flatter distributions, e.g., α=−1.2 to −1.0 (Saunders et al. 1990, Takeuchi et al. 2003, Vaccari et al. 2010). In practice, the faint end has not been well sampled locally except in a few of the IRAS surveys. Future analysis of the widest Herschel surveys may help resolve this.',\n",
       "  'In local, relatively quiescent spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, more than half of the FIR luminosity is believed to arise, not from dust in active star-forming regions, but from dust in the general ISM that is heated by ambient starlight from intermediate- and older-age stellar populations (Lonsdale Persson & Helou 1987, Sodriski et al. 1997). The luminosity of the Milky Way is typical (L\\nIR≈1010L⊙) (Sodriski et al. 1997) compared with the knee of the local IRLF at \\n\\n (Sanders et al. 2003). This implies that a significant fraction of the local IR luminosity density is not the direct result of young star formation. Thus, it may not be a good measure of the global SFR today. At higher redshift when the specific SFR of typical galaxies was much larger and the net dust extinction to star-forming regions was, on average, larger (see Section 5.1), we may expect the IRLF and its integral to more reliably trace the total SFRD. However, Salim et al. (2009) suggested that, even at higher redshift (z≈0.7), intermediate-age stars may significantly contribute to MIR dust emission observed by Spitzer at 24 μm.',\n",

Analyses of these generally agreed that the emission from dusty star formation increased steeply with redshift, although statistics were generally too poor to construct redshift-dependent LFs. Chary & Elbaz (2001) used measurements from ISO and SCUBA as well as constraints from the FIR background as measured by the COBE satellite to constrain a model for the evolution of the cosmic SFH. Their model exhibited a sharp decline in the SFRD by a factor of 10 or more from z≈0.8 to the present, with a plateau of nearly constant star formation at 0.8 < z < 2. At higher redshifts, the SFRD was more poorly constrained. Submillimeter sources placed a rough lower bound, whereas the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) set an upper limit. Acceptable solutions ranged from flat evolution to an increase by a factor of ∼10 from z = 4.5 to 2.',\n",
       "  \"\\nSpitzer greatly enhanced the sensitivity and mapping efficiency for deep IR observations, particularly at 24 μm where the beam size (FWHM ≈ 5.7 arcsec) was small enough to enable relatively straightforward association with optical counterparts. Spitzer also observed in an era when very large spectroscopic redshift surveys were available or under way and when photometric redshift techniques were well established. Le Floc'h et al. (2005) produced an early, seminal analysis of 24-μm sources at 0.3 < z < 1.2 in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South. Integrating over derived IRLFs, they inferred an evolution of the IR luminosity density proportional to (1+z)3.9±0.4, significantly steeper than the evolving UV luminosity density, ρFUV∝(1+z)2.5 (Schiminovich et al. 2005). With strong luminosity evolution, the fraction of the IR luminosity density produced by LIGs and ULIGs evolved even more steeply: Le Floc'h et al. (2005) found that galaxies with L\\nIR>1011L⊙ produced 70% ± 15% of the IR luminosity density at z≈1, compared with ∼5–15% today, depending on the adopted local LF.

(2010) at 24 μm and Patel et al. (2013) at 70 μm and 160 μm. The work by Rujopakarn et al. (2010) is particularly notable for its combination of (relatively) wide area (9 deg2), extensive spectroscopic redshifts (4,047 galaxies with z⩽0.65), and 24-μm sensitivity (0.27 mJy, sufficient to reach ∼L∗ out to z = 0.65), making it arguably the best bridge study to date between local (IRAS and AKARI) measurements and deep-field studies at z⩾1.\",\n",

At the faint end, the available data rarely constrain the slope of the LF at high redshift. Indeed, as noted above, there are significant differences in the faint-end slopes that have been measured at z≈0. Data with a limiting 24-μm flux density of 80 μJy (as found for most of the earlier Spitzer studies described above) reach only a factor of a few fainter than typical estimates of \\n\\n at z≈1, and they barely reach \\n\\n at z≈2. Thus, most analyses are forced to assume a faint-end slope based on measurements at lower redshifts, making them subject to large (typically >100%) and uncertain extrapolations to total IR luminosity densities.',\n",

Indeed, we expect such variations among real galaxies. Compared with several other studies, Pérez-González et al. (2005) found many more galaxies with L\\nIR>1012L⊙ at z≈2, in part owing to different assumptions about these bolometric corrections. Also, different procedures to account for AGN emission (which can be particularly strong in the MIR) as well as heavy reliance on photometric redshifts may contribute to systematic issues in the IRLF, particularly at the bright end.',\n",

This suggested that true FIR measurements were needed to reliably determine luminosities and SFRs at high redshift. Huynh et al.

(2009) found that the average FIR over MIR flux ratios closely matched predictions from the template library of Chary & Elbaz (2001). They also measured LFs that were similar to previous measurements, but that extended to fainter luminosities significantly below the bend in the IRLF at z≈1 and with better statistics. At z>1.3, however, Magnelli et al. (2011) confirmed previous suggestions that the average 70-μm to 24-μm flux ratios deviated systematically from the predictions of standard local SED templates. They extrapolated from the averaged 70-μm fluxes to the bolometric IRLF and found only a mild increase in L∗ and the luminosity contribution of ULIRGs from z≈1 to 2. At lower redshifts, the faint-end slope was consistent with α=−1.6 as measured for local IRAS galaxies by Sanders et al. (2003). By z = 2, the data reach only slightly fainter than the IRLF knee, and the slope is not constrained. However, extrapolating with a fixed slope α=−1.6, Magnelli et al. (2011) found that the faint IRLF at z = 2 would be quite similar to that predicted by Reddy et al. (2008) on the basis of UV-selected galaxies and the dust absorption predicted from their UV spectral slopes.',\n",
       "  'The Herschel Space Observatory significantly improved sensitivity and reduced the beam size for FIR (70–500 μm) observations, and several large programs were dedicated to surveys of the most important multiwavelength-deep fields. Even the deepest Herschel surveys do not detect as many sources per square arcminute as are found in the deepest Spitzer 24-μm observations, but direct access to FIR wavelengths is invaluable for reliably estimating bolometric luminosities and SFRs at high redshift. Several analyses presented preliminary LFs out to z = 2 to 3 using data sets obtained early in the Herschel mission (Eales et al. 2010, Gruppioni et al. 2010, Lapi et al. 2011).',\n",
       "  'More extensive analyses of larger Herschel data sets have recently appeared in the literature. Gruppioni et al. (2013) used sources selected in Herschel PACS observations at 70, 100, and 160 μm in the two GOODS fields as well as shallower but wider observations of the Extended Chandra Deep Field South and COSMOS. They fit customized IR SED templates to photometry from both the PACS and SPIRE (250–500 μm) instruments and computed IR luminosities based on spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. They derived LFs out to z<4.2. However, at the highest redshifts (3 < z < 4.2), the data are sensitive only to the rarest hyperluminous sources. Limiting their analysis to z<2.3, Magnelli et al. (2013) restricted their study to the deepest 70–160-μm data available in the GOODS fields and extracted FIR fluxes to still-fainter limits at positions of 24-μm-detected sources. Note that, as is often the case, the fields analyzed and the data used in these studies overlap considerably; even if the methods of analysis are different, they cannot be considered to be fully independent. That said, in their range of overlap, the two analyses are generally consistent: They find somewhat stronger luminosity evolution at z>1 than in the Spitzer analysis of Magnelli et al. (2011) and, hence, demonstrate a larger contribution of ULIRGs to the total IR luminosity density at z≈2 [but not as large as in some earlier Spitzer studies, e.g., by Pérez-González et al. (2005)]. Magnelli et al. (2011) concluded that this difference (compared with their own very similar Spitzer analysis) is mainly due to better determination of the total IR luminosities of galaxies using the improved Herschel FIR measurements. Gruppioni et al. (2013) found that the characteristic luminosity \\n\\n continued to brighten at z>2, albeit at a slower rate. Neither survey reliably measured the faint-end slope of the IRLF at high redshift, and both fixed it to values derived locally. Each study adopted distinct values: Magnelli et al. (2011) used α=−1.6, whereas Gruppioni et al. (2013) used α = −1.2. Given these different slopes, it is striking and perhaps surprising that these two analyses derive similar values for the total IR luminosity density at redshifts 0<z<2. Broadly speaking, both studies find evolution by a factor of ∼6 between z = 1.1 and today and comparatively flat evolution at higher redshift to 〈z〉=2.05 (Magnelli et al. 2011) and 〈z〉=2.75 (Gruppioni et al. 2013), albeit with an increasing range of values allowed within the measurement uncertainties.',\n",

       "  'Before Spitzer and Herschel, ground-based submillimeter bolometer arrays, especially SCUBA at JCMT, provided an essential glimpse at dusty star formation at very high redshifts. As is frequently noted, the negative K correction at submillimeter wavelengths approximately cancels luminosity distance dimming at z>1. The flux limits of most submillimeter surveys constrain individual source detections to ultra- and hyperluminous galaxies, so that only the tip of the IRLF is sampled. In practice, the greatest limitation for deriving LFs or SFRD is identifying galaxy counterparts to submillimeter sources and measuring their redshifts. This limitation is due mainly to the large beam size of single-dish submillimeter observations, but it is also due to the fact that the optical counterparts are often very faint and sometimes invisible. Another consequence of the negative K correction is that substantial redshift uncertainties translate to only relatively small uncertainties in the bolometric luminosity. Hence, using radio-identified counterparts and very rough radio-millimetric redshift estimates, Barger et al. (2000) were able to make plausible estimates of the SFRD from submillimeter sources in broad redshift bins. Barger et al. (2012) recently updated their findings using a complete submillimeter galaxy (SMG) sample with accurate interferometric positions from the submillimeter array (SMA) and with more extensive redshift information, made possible in part thanks to recent advances in millimetric CO spectroscopy. Chapman et al. (2005) measured optical spectroscopic redshifts for a sample of radio-identified SMGs and derived the first SMG LFs at 〈z〉=0.9 and 〈z〉=2.5. These estimates were recently updated by Wardlow et al. (2011) using (mainly) photometric redshifts for another well-defined SMG sample. These analyses demonstrated a significant contribution of dusty SMGs to the cosmic SFRD at high redshift, mainly limited to z≲4. However, recent discoveries of substantial numbers of SMGs out to z = 6.3 (e.g., Riechers et al. 2013) suggest that the dusty ultraluminous population may be important even in the first few billion years of the cosmic SFH.',\n",
       "  'Although direct FIR detection of individual sources at z≫2 is limited to the most extremely luminous objects (\\nFigure 1\\n), the CIRB provides additional constraints on dusty star formation at the highest redshifts (Pei et al. 1999, Gispert et al. 2000). FIR source counts and the CIRB were reviewed by Lagache et al. (2005) and recent results from Herschel are reviewed by Lutz (2014) in this volume, so we only briefly discuss this topic here. Sources directly detected by Herschel in the deepest observations resolve ∼75% of the CIRB at 100 and 160 μm (Berta et al. 2011, Magnelli et al. 2013), albeit with significant uncertainties at 100 μm. Stacking Herschel data at the position of sources detected by Spitzer at 24 μm detects an even larger fraction that, with modest extrapolation, can account for the entire CIRB at these wavelengths. At 250 to 500 μm, where confusion is more severe in Herschel SPIRE data, the directly resolved fractions are smaller (from 15% to 5% at 250 to 500 μm), whereas stacking detects 73% to 55%. Again, an extrapolation is consistent with resolving the entire background (Béthermin et al. 2012). Because the deepest Herschel observations were carried out in fields such as GOODS and COSMOS with exceptional ancillary data, it is possible to stack in bins of photometric redshift to constrain the redshift distribution of the CIRB emission. At higher redshifts, the peak of dust emission from galaxies shifts to longer FIR and submillimeter wavelengths, and the fractional contribution of more-distant galaxies increases with the wavelength of the bandpass analyzed. Combining data from Spitzer through Herschel to ground-based submillimeter observations, Béthermin et al. (2012) estimated that 4.7 ± 2.0 nW m−2 sr−1, or 17+11\\n−9% of the integrated CIRB, is produced by galaxies at z>2. Although the fraction is small, it still allows for a significant amount of dusty star formation to take place at z>2, beyond what is seen in directly detected sources. However, the 24-μm sources used for these stacking analyses are also subject to strong k-correction dimming at z>2. Thus, a larger fraction of the high-redshift CIRB may have been missed.',\n",
       "  'Among the nebular emission lines that have been most frequently used to quantify SFRs at high redshift, Hα is arguably the most useful (see Section 3.1.4). Lines from other elements, most commonly [Oii] 3,727 Å, have also been used to measure the cosmic SFR (e.g., Hogg et al. 1998), but their more complex dependence on metallicity and ISM conditions as well as their larger extinction make them problematic. Narrow-band Lyα surveys are popular at high redshift, but Lyα is so strongly subject to resonant scattering and extinction that it must always be regarded as setting only a lower limit on the true SFR.',\n",
       "  'Hα is accessible with optical observations only at z<0.5, and NIR observations are needed to follow it out to higher redshifts (z≲2.5). Recent technological developments in IR instrumentation have significantly increased the potential for such measurements. A new generation of wide-field imagers using mosaics of IR arrays is now operating on 4-m- and 8-m-class telescopes (e.g., UKIRT WFCAM, CFHT WIRCAM, NOAO NEWFIRM, VISTA VIRCAM, VLT HAWK-I), thereby significantly increasing the comoving volumes accessible for deep narrow-band imaging. NIR multiobject spectrographs are now becoming mature and efficient (e.g., Subaru MOIRCS and FMOS, Keck MOSFIRE, VLT KMOS, LBT LUCI). Slitless grism spectroscopy with WFC3 on the HST can measure faint Hα lines out to z<1.5 for all objects within its field of view. Each method has advantages and disadvantages. Narrow-band imaging surveys are tuned to specific, narrow redshift ranges and are strongly subject to density variations due to line-of-sight clustering effects. Flux calibration for objects whose redshifts place emission lines in the wings of the narrow bandpasses can also be problematic. Only statistical corrections can be made for the flux contribution from [Nii] or for stellar absorption. Multislit spectroscopy is subject to slit losses that complicate measurements of integrated line fluxes, and atmospheric absorption and emission significantly limit the accessible redshifts and can introduce complicated selection effects. (The new VLT KMOS spectrograph uses multiple deployable integral field units, thus eliminating slit-loss concerns, and may prove to be a valuable tool for Hα surveys.) HST WFC3 slitless spectroscopy avoids concerns about the atmosphere and slit losses, but deep observations covering adequately large solid angles are time intensive. As of this writing, results on Hα LFs from the largest ongoing programs [WISPS (Atek et al. 2010) and 3D-HST (Brammer et al. 2012)] have not appeared in the literature to supersede earlier HST NICMOS results (Yan et al. 1999, Hopkins et al. 2000, Shim et al. 2009). With all methods, reliable extinction corrections depend on the measurement of the Balmer decrement (the ratio of Hα to Hβ line fluxes). This is rarely available for narrow-band surveys, but it is sometimes available for spectroscopic samples. However, in such cases, the sample selection is often limited by the weaker Hβ line. Hence, statistical corrections are often adopted. AGN and LINERs can also contribute significantly to the samples of emission line galaxies and can be reliably taken into account only using high-quality spectroscopic data to measure line-excitation diagnostics. Most careful studies of the local galaxy population using spectroscopy from SDSS or GAMA (see below) have done this, but it is rarely possible at higher redshifts. Thus, most studies have resorted to statistical corrections or none at all.',\n",
       "  'Much literature discusses LF and SFRD measurements from Hα, [Oii] and [Oiii], and we note only selected works here. Gunawardhana et al. (2013) included a thorough and up-to-date compilation of these measurements at low and high redshifts. Using objective prism photographic data, Gallego et al. (1995) presented an important early study of the local Hα LF. Subsequently, the SDSS provided a vast number of spectroscopic redshifts and line-flux measurements, although the small aperture size of the spectroscopic fibers requires careful and inevitably uncertain corrections to the total emission line flux for each galaxy. SDSS spectroscopy covers both Hα and Hβ and can provide a measurement of extinction via the Balmer decrement, although care is needed to account for stellar absorption, flux limits, and selection effects. Brinchmann et al. (2004) conducted a widely cited study of local star formation from SDSS optical spectroscopy and photometry. They used a full analysis of the emission and absorption line spectroscopy. Thus, their study was not strictly based on Hα alone, although the Balmer lines carry significant weight in the SFR determinations. As noted above, Salim et al. (2007) carried out an independent SDSS analysis based mainly on photometry including GALEX UV measurements but with extensive cross comparison to the Hα data. By using photometry, the Salim analysis bypasses uncertainties inherent in the spectroscopic Hα aperture corrections. The local SFRDs (normalized to z = 0.1) from the studies by Brinchmann et al. (2004) and Salim et al. (2007) agree extremely well. Most recently, Gunawardhana et al. (2013) combined data from the SDSS with significantly deeper (but also much smaller) fiber spectroscopy from the GAMA survey to probe fainter down the LF and extend the analysis to higher redshifts (z<0.35).',\n",
       "  'Optical spectroscopic surveys have measured Hα SFRDs typically out to z<0.4 (e.g., Tresse & Maddox 1998, Sullivan et al. 2000, Westra et al. 2010, Gunawardhana et al. 2013). Until recently, NIR spectroscopy was measured only for small samples, object by object, typically at 0.5<z<1.1 (Glazebrook et al. 1999, Tresse et al. 2002, Doherty et al. 2006). In general, nebular line extinction is not directly measured and can only be assumed. The same is true for corrections for stellar absorption. Larger-scale and deeper spectroscopic surveys from a new generation of multiobject IR spectrographs on 8–10-m telescopes should be forthcoming.',\n",
       "  'Several studies have exploited slitless grism spectroscopy of Hα at 0.7<z<1.9 from the HST NICMOS instrument (Yan et al. 1999, Hopkins et al. 2000, Shim et al. 2009). These studies are of small but relatively unbiased samples that are observed with relatively uniform sensitivity over a broad redshift range and without concerns for flux losses due to a finite spectrograph slit size. Once again, direct measurements of extinction are generally unavailable, and the low-resolution slitless spectroscopy inextricably blends Hα with [Nii], thus requiring purely statistical corrections. New, more sensitive grism surveys with HST WFC3 that cover larger solid angles are under way.',\n",
       "  'The largest number of high-redshift measurements has come from narrow-band imaging surveys using wide-field CCD cameras out to z≈0.4 and with IR arrays at higher redshifts. These are generally carried out using filters that fit into spectral windows relatively unaffected by atmospheric absorption or emission and that correspond to specific redshifts (z = 0.24, 0.40, 0.84, 1.47, and 2.23 are all common). Using a new generation of wide-field imagers, the current state-of-the-art Hα surveys include those of Ly et al. (2007, 2011), Hayes et al. (2010), and Sobral et al. (2013). The latter survey (HiZELS) combines data from Subaru Suprime-Cam (z = 0.40) and UKIRT WFCAM (z = 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23): It covers ∼2 deg2 in two survey fields, with deeper but narrower (0.03 deg2) observations at z = 2.23 from the VLT and its HAWK-I imager. Between 500 and 1750 Hα emitters are detected in each redshift window, thereby providing good statistics. These authors measured a steady increase in the characteristic luminosity L∗(Hα) with redshift and a faint-end slope α≈1.6 that is constant with redshift and is also similar to that found in most of the UV continuum surveys.',\n",
       "  'Centimeter-wavelength radio continuum emission from star-forming galaxies arises from a combination of flat-spectrum free-free emission, which is prominent at high frequencies, and steep spectrum synchrotron emission, which dominates at lower frequencies. Although the free-free emission should be a direct tracer of star-formation rates, it has been impractical to observe this at high redshift. However, the improved high-frequency sensitivity of the Jansky VLA should open this capability in the future. The lower-frequency emission arises mainly as a consequence of SNe. As such, it is also related to the SFR. In practice, its calibration as an SFR measurement is primarily empirical, e.g., based on the tight correlation observed between radio and far-IR emission for IRAS-selected galaxies in the local Universe (e.g., Yun et al. 2001). This correlation together with insensitivity to dust extinction makes radio emission an attractive wavelength for studying star formation.',\n",
       "  'Problematically, AGN can also produce powerful radio emission. Locally, radio sources with L\\nν(1.4GHz)>1023 W Hz−1 are predominantly AGN. This radio luminosity corresponds to an SFR >94M⊙ year−1, using the conversion factor from Murphy et al. (2011) scaled to a Salpeter IMF. Such galaxies are extremely rare locally, so very powerful radio sources are commonly excluded as likely AGN. However, at z>1, galaxies with these SFRs (corresponding to ULIRGs in terms of their IR luminosities) are common, even “normal” (see Section 3.1.2). Thus, it is problematic to disregard them simply on the basis of their radio emission. Other considerations are needed to distinguish AGN from star-forming radio sources, such as radio spectral index, radio morphology, or radio/IR flux ratios, but these are all more difficult to measure, especially for very faint sources.',\n",
       "  'The local radio LF has been used to estimate the current SFRD in many studies (for recent examples, see Machalski & Godlowski 2000, Condon et al. 2002, Sadler et al. 2002, Serjeant et al. 2002, Mauch & Sadler 2007). In these studies, the authors carefully employed various criteria to separate AGN from star-forming galaxies. Data were often compared with IRAS IR measurements and excluded objects with a radio excess relative to their IR luminosities.',\n",
       "  'At z>1, even the deepest VLA surveys have been able to detect galaxies with SFRs only ≳100M⊙ year−1 (\\nFigure 1\\n) and ≳1, 000M⊙ year−1 at z>3, although the Jansky VLA is now pushing to fainter sensitivities. Haarsma et al. (2000) were among the first to combine very deep VLA observations with spectroscopic and photometric redshift information to derive radio LFs and the cosmic SFRD at high redshift, primarily at 0.3<z<0.8. However, they also considered one very broad bin from 1<z<4.4. Based on individually detected radio sources, this work was updated in later studies that took advantage of more extensive multiwavelength data to distinguish AGN from star-forming galaxies. Seymour et al. (2008) identified AGN based on radio spectral indexes, radio morphology, and radio to NIR and MIR flux ratios. Smolčić et al. (2009) used optical SED criteria to identify star-forming galaxies detected in VLA 1.4 GHz data for COSMOS at more modest redshifts z<1.3. Seymour et al. (2008) assumed pure luminosity evolution for the LF, consistent with the measurements by Smolčić et al. (2009) (and earlier by Haarsma et al. 2000). All these studies found broad agreement between the radio SFRD evolution and optical and IR surveys, noting a steep decline from z = 1 to 0; Seymour et al. (2008) measured a peak SFRD at z≈1.5, albeit with large uncertainties.',\n",
       "  'Other studies have used radio stacking to probe to fainter luminosities below the detection limits for individual sources—particularly, stacking for NIR samples that approximate stellar mass selection. Here, the assumption is that, as in the local Universe, radio sources at fainter luminosities will primarily trace star formation with relatively little AGN contribution. Dunne et al. (2009) stacked VLA 1.4 GHz and GMRT 610 MHz data for K-band-selected sources in bins of redshift and K-band luminosity. They found a linear (but redshift-dependent) relation between radio and NIR luminosity. Using a measurement of the evolving K-band LF from the same data set, they then used this radio/NIR ratio to extrapolate the observations to the total radio luminosity density and SFRD. Karim et al. (2011) used a large 1.4-GHz survey of COSMOS and a Spitzer 3.6-μm-selected sample to carry out the most extensive study of this sort to date. Stacking in bins of stellar mass and photometric redshift and converting the mean radio fluxes to SFRs, they extensively analyzed the SFR-M∗ correlation and used this and the evolving stellar mass function (SMF) (from Ilbert et al. 2010) to compute the integrated SFRD. Dunne et al. (2009) measured a steady increase in the SFRD from z≈0 to a peak at z≈1.5 that declined at higher redshift to z≈4. By contrast, Karim et al. (2011) found a monotonic decline in the SFRD from z = 3 to today.',\n",
       "  'As the technology of NIR detectors advanced, so did surveys that used NIR photometry to better sample galaxies by stellar mass at both low and high redshifts (e.g., Cowie et al. 1996, Gavazzi et al. 1996). However, it was not until the turn of the millennium that authors started to routinely use stellar population synthesis models to convert photometry and redshift information to stellar masses for large samples of galaxies, especially at high redshift. Before the era of large, modern redshift surveys such as the SDSS and the 2dFGRS, several authors made estimates of the local baryonic densities and SMDs (Persic & Salucci 1992; Fukugita et al. 1998; Salucci & Persic 1999). This effort accelerated, however, as new spectroscopic surveys mapped the local Universe. Cole et al. (2001) used 2dFGRS redshifts and NIR photometry from 2MASS to measure the local K-band LF more accurately than had previously been possible. Then, using stellar population modeling, they inferred stellar masses from the galaxy colors and luminosities and derived the local galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) and the local comoving SMD. Bell et al. (2003) did the same using SDSS and 2MASS. Many studies have subsequently derived the GSMF from incrementally improving SDSS data releases, using additional ancillary data and a variety of methods for stellar population modeling; mass-to-light ratios are sometimes derived from photometry and from the SDSS spectra (Panter et al. 2007, Baldry et al. 2008, Li & White 2009). Moustakas et al. (2013) incorporated photometry from the UV (GALEX) to the MIR (WISE) in their analysis of the SDSS GSMF. Baldry et al. (2012) analyzed a sample from GAMA, a wide-area spectroscopic survey extending significantly fainter than the SDSS, modeling M/L from optical SDSS photometry. As the samples have grown larger, more elaborate functional forms have been fit to the GSMF, including double and even triple Schechter functions, and there is some evidence that the GSMF slope at low masses (<109\\nM\\n⊙) may be steeper than was previously believed (e.g., α=−1.47) (Baldry et al. 2012). Other authors have modeled stellar populations for ensembles of galaxies rather than deriving individual galaxy stellar masses, e.g., by fitting the integrated local luminosity densities for the entire local volume from UV to NIR wavelengths (Baldry & Glazebrook 2003) or by modeling coadded SDSS spectra in bins of luminosity, velocity dispersion, and 4,000-Å break strength (Gallazzi et al. 2008).',\n",
       "  'At higher redshifts, Brinchmann & Ellis (2000) derived stellar masses for galaxies at z<1 in fields with both HST and NIR imaging. As expected given the declining cosmic SFRD at those redshifts, they found relatively little evolution in the integrated mass density at 0.4<z<0.9 but a marked evolution in the mass breakdown by morphological type. Cohen (2002) similarly found no significant evolution in the SMD at 0.25<z<1.05. Because the cosmic SFRD declines steeply with time at z<1, relatively little new stellar mass accumulates in the late stages of cosmic history. Moustakas et al. (2013) recently broke new ground with a low-resolution prism spectroscopic survey measuring ∼40,000 redshifts for galaxies at 0.2<z<1 in five fields with Spitzer IRAC photometry covering 5.5 deg2. Even with such outstanding data, the evolution in the overall SMF at 0<z<1 is nearly imperceptible, but the migration of galaxies from the star-forming to the quiescent population is confirmed with exquisite detail.',\n",

(2001) pioneered the use of stellar population models to derive stellar masses for LBGs at z ≈ 2–3. Giallongo et al. (1998) computed comoving SMDs out to z ≈ 4 for galaxies from a relatively bright, optically selected sample, and measured steep evolution, but did not attempt to correct for unobserved galaxies fainter than the limits of their data. Subsequently, Dickinson et al. (2003), Fontana et al. (2003), and Rudnick et al. (2003) used the deepest NIR imaging then available for the two HDFs, HST NICMOS (HDF-N) and VLT ISAAC (HDF-S), together with extensive photometric and spectroscopic redshifts to derive the comoving SMD in several redshift bins out to z≈3. Strong evolution was found over that longer redshift baseline; the SMD at z≈3 measured in the range 5% to 15% of its present-day value, although a somewhat broader range of values would be permitted if systematic assumptions about the galaxy SFHs or stellar metallicities were pushed well beyond the range of models used for standard analysis. The SMD reached half its present-day value somewhere between z = 2 and 1. Strong cosmic variance in these small fields was also evident: At z>2, red galaxies with high mass-to-light ratios were nearly absent in the HDF-N but were found in moderate abundance in the HDF-S. By contrast, the corresponding SMDs differed substantially. This indicated the importance of surveying larger fields and more sightlines, but obtaining IR imaging to satisfactory depth over these larger regions of sky has proven to be very challenging and has required another decade of effort.',\n",
       "  \"The launch of Spitzer and the impressive performance of its IRAC camera for imaging at 3.6 to 8 μm made it possible to measure rest-frame NIR photometry for galaxies at high redshift, and major public survey imaging campaigns such as GOODS, S-COSMOS, and SWIRE produced widely accessible and heavily used imaging data sets spanning a wide range of area-depth parameter space, ideal for deriving SMFs and densities at high redshift. Indeed, NIR imaging has struggled to catch up with IRAC in terms of comparable area-depth coverage. Despite the vast swaths of telescope time that have been invested in obtaining NIR data on popular fields such as GOODS and COSMOS, imaging at 1 to 2.5 μm still tends to fall short of Spitzer's sensitivity at 3.6 and 4.5 μm. At z>4.5, the ground-based K-band samples rest-frame UV wavelengths, and IRAC offers the only viable way to measure optical rest-frame light to constrain stellar masses.\",\n",

There are indications that the faint-end slope of the mass function may steepen at higher redshifts (e.g., Kajisawa et al. 2009, Santini et al. 2012). The integrated SMDs measured in the different analyses generally agreed within factors of 2 at most redshifts, and a consistent picture of mass build-up emerged.',\n",

Together with ever-growing spectroscopic surveys and increasingly excellent photometric redshifts, these have yielded the most statistically robust measurements of the SMFs at z<2.5.

For this reason, nearly all analyses of SMDs at z>4 have been carried out in GOODS and the HUDF [in a departure from the GOODS-dominated norm, McLure et al. (2009) stacked relatively shallow IRAC data for LBGs at z = 5 and 6 in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey to measure average SEDs and mass-to-light ratios and, hence, to estimate the SMD], and nearly all have studied UV-selected LBGs, for which there are abundant samples. Early analyses of small samples of galaxies at z = 5 and 6, including estimates of the integrated SMD, were presented by Yan et al. (2006), Eyles et al. (2007), Stark et al. (2007), Verma et al. (2007), and Yabe et al. (2009). These were followed by larger and more systematic analyses of LBG samples at 4⩾z⩾7 (Stark et al. 2009, González et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2012), all of which used similar procedures and found broadly similar results. In particular, the derived LBG SMFs have somewhat shallower low-mass slopes than do the UVLFs, because M/LUV\\n decreases at fainter UV luminosities, at least at z = 4 and 5 where this could be measured with some robustness from galaxies with individual IRAC detections (e.g., Lee et al. 2012). Using HST WFC3-selected samples in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS fields, Labbé et al. (2013) recently extended this analysis to z≈8.',\n",
       "  'Exceptionally, some studies have used IRAC selection to avoid the potential bias of UV selection against older or dustier galaxies. Caputi et al. (2011) analyzed an IRAC 4.5-μm-selected sample in the UKIDSS Ultradeep Survey, thereby computing SMDs at 3⩽z⩽5. The depth of their IRAC data limited direct detections to a stellar mass completeness limit ≳1010.4M⊙. Their extrapolated mass densities based on Schechter function fits fall somewhat below those from other LBG-based studies (e.g., González et al. 2011, Lee et al. 2012), but this is likely due to uncertainties in the large extrapolation required. Several other authors have analyzed partially or wholly IRAC-selected candidates for massive galaxies at z≳3.5 (Wiklind et al. 2008, Mancini et al. 2009, Marchesini et al. 2010, Caputi et al. 2012). In some cases, they have estimated comoving SMDs, although generally without fitting SMFs and often without rigorous analysis of sample completeness.',\n",
       "  'Several studies have suggested that LBGs at z≳4 have much stronger optical rest-frame nebular line emission (particularly Hα and [Oiii]) than do similar UV-selected galaxies at lower redshifts (Chary et al. 2005, Raiter et al. 2010, Shim et al. 2011, Labbé et al. 2013, Stark et al. 2013). In most cases, this has been inferred on the basis of Spitzer IRAC colors that would be unusual for pure stellar populations but that can be explained if strong line emission boosts the IRAC fluxes. This line emission, if not taken into account, can significantly affect derived stellar population parameters and generally leads to overestimated stellar masses. For LBG samples at z = 4 to 8, Stark et al. (2013) and Labbé et al. (2013) estimated that average stellar masses derived from models without nebular lines should be reduced by factors from 10% to 70%, with the effect increasing at higher redshifts. Although the photometric evidence for this strong nebular emission is compelling, it will be vitally important for JWST spectroscopy to confirm and quantify its effects.',\n",
       "  'Galaxy evolution surveys have amassed a remarkable wealth of new data in the past two decades. Newer, larger, and deeper surveys have supplanted earlier work and have provided more statistically robust measurements of the SFR and stellar mass densities at many different redshifts. Nevertheless, there are still shortcomings in even the best data or in our use of those data, which may significantly limit the accuracy or reliability of measurements of the cosmic SFH. Here we consider the strengths and weaknesses of the best measurements to date, from the local Universe out to the highest redshifts.',\n",
       "  \"To be statistically meaningful, measurements of the current SFR or SMD require surveys covering a large fraction of the sky. Salim et al. (2007) and Robotham & Driver (2011) used most or all of the GALEX Medium Imaging Survey data, covering ∼1,000 deg2 overlapping the SDSS and 2dFGRS spectroscopic surveys, and there is little prospect for improving the UV data in the near future. Only refinements in the analysis can be expected, e.g., incorporating improved photometric data at optical or NIR wavelengths, or further joint analysis with spectroscopic stellar population measurements. As discussed below (Section 5.1) (\\nFigure 8\\n), there is significant disagreement in the literature about the net FUV extinction correction at z≈0. Wide-area spectroscopic emission line surveys (e.g., from SDSS or GAMA) (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Gunawardhana et al. 2013) are limited by uncertain aperture corrections to line fluxes, whereas narrow-band imaging surveys have yet to cover enough galaxies over a wide enough area and are usually limited by the absence of direct measurements of extinction from the Balmer decrement, the [Nii] contribution to Hα measurements, or the contribution of AGN emission. There is still room for progress in combined narrow-band plus spectroscopic data for large local samples. The local FIRLF has not been drastically revised since the final IRAS analyses (Sanders et al. 2003, Takeuchi et al. 2003); additional AKARI data did not drastically change earlier results (Goto et al. 2011a,b; Sedgwick et al. 2011). The biggest remaining uncertainties pertain to the faint-end slope, where measurements vary significantly from α=−1.2 to −1.8 (or, somewhat implausibly, even −2.0) (e.g., Goto et al. 2011b). Analysis of the widest-area FIR surveys from Herschel, such as H-ATLAS (570 deg2) (Eales et al. 2010), may help with this. The present uncertainties lead to a difference of a factor of at least 2 to 3 in the local FIR luminosity density. Nevertheless, as previously noted, in today's relatively “dead” epoch of cosmic star formation, a significant fraction of the FIR emission from ordinary spiral galaxies may arise from dust heated by intermediate-age and older stellar populations, not newly formed OB stars. Hence, it is not necessarily the best measure of the SFR. At higher redshifts, when the cosmic-specific SFR was much larger, new star formation should dominate dust heating, making the IR emission a more robust global tracer.\\n\",\n",

There may still be concerns about missing light, surface brightness biases, etc., in the 2MASS data (e.g., Bell et al. 2003), and deeper very-wide-field NIR data would be helpful. All-sky MIR data from WISE may be valuable and have been used by Moustakas et al. (2013), but without extensive analysis specifically focused on this topic. Deeper NIR data covering a significant fraction of the sky, either from new wide-field ground-based NIR telescopes with large apertures or from space-based surveys with EUCLID or WFIRST, would make a valuable new contribution. Otherwise, as for UV SFRs, the most likely improvements will come from refined stellar population analyses, rather than from new data.',\n",
       "  'During the decline and fall of cosmic star formation, from z≈1 to 0, the greatest weakness of current measurements is that they have generally covered small sky areas and small comoving volumes over few independent sightlines. Hence, they may be subject to significant cosmic variance uncertainties. Fields such as GOODS, which have been analyzed many times, are too small to offer precision measurements in fine redshift bins at z<1. Even the 2 deg2 COSMOS field subtends less than 100 Mpc at z<1 and can be spanned by large-scale structure; as a single sightline, it is subject to density fluctuations. Although very good data for measuring the SFRD or SMD at z<1 exist in many fields, relatively little information has been analyzed thoroughly, in part because intensive effort on spectroscopic (or even photometric) redshifts has been applied to only the few, most famous fields. Sometimes, even fields such as AEGIS, which has outstanding spectroscopy and deep GALEX, Spitzer, and Herschel data, have not been fully exploited for this purpose.',\n",
       "  'For example, very deep GALEX data exist for several of the most famous survey fields, but the one widely cited analysis of the UV luminosity density at z<1 (Schiminovich et al. 2005) uses only ∼1,000 sources with redshifts in a single 0.5-deg2 field. Expanded analysis of comparably deep GALEX data in COSMOS, AEGIS, and several other survey fields with existing, extensive spectroscopy is long overdue. There are no opportunities to collect more GALEX data, but deep U-band imaging measuring somewhat longer rest-frame UV wavelengths may be quite adequate for many purposes. Such data exist or could be obtained with wide-field imagers, but the best analysis to date (Cucciati et al. 2012), using ∼11,000 spectroscopic redshifts, is limited to a single 0.6-deg2 sightline [indeed, the same field analyzed by Schiminovich et al. (2005) with GALEX]. Much more work can be done to improve this situation, with relatively limited new observational effort and often using data that already exist.',\n",
       "  'Similarly, most analyses of MIR and FIR data from Spitzer and Herschel data have used data from, at most, three independent sightlines (e.g., Magnelli et al. 2009, Rodighiero et al. 2010, Gruppioni et al. 2013), nearly always combining the two GOODS fields with one shallower but wider data set (e.g., COSMOS or the VVDS-SWIRE field). The widest-area analysis to date is that of Rujopakarn et al. (2010), which used 24-μm-selected sources at z<0.65 from the 9-deg2 Boötes survey. In practice, more data over more sightlines exist. Large consortium surveys such as the PEP and HerMES Herschel Guaranteed Time programs have mapped many fields, often with an elegant hierarchy of different areas and depths, but these have not yet been exploited and combined into a single, definitive analysis. Typically, this is because the ancillary imaging and spectroscopy needed to identify IR source counterparts and to determine their redshifts is available or adequate in only a few fields (hence, the repeated analyses of GOODS and COSMOS).',\n",
       "  'Many of these same comments apply to SMD estimates at z<1. In this case, the state of the art has recently been improved by Moustakas et al. (2013), who analyzed five independent fields with a combined solid angle of 5.5 deg2 with (relatively shallow) IRAC photometry and (low-resolution) spectroscopic redshifts. This is the best combination of area, depth, number of sightlines, and redshift quality for any study of the SMD at z<1 and is also superior to any data used to date for SFRD studies at similar redshifts. Deeper ground-based NIR data were used by Bielby et al. (2012), who analyzed four fields covering 2.1 deg2, and by several studies of the single 2-deg2 COSMOS field (e.g., Ilbert et al. 2013). New wide-area surveys such as VISTA VIDEO (Jarvis 2012) (ground-based NIR, three fields, 12 deg2) and SERVS (Mauduit et al. 2012) (Spitzer IRAC, five fields, 18 deg2, overlapping VIDEO) will provide excellent new data to improve mass function estimates, but only if adequate redshift information and supporting optical photometry are available.',\n",
       "  'At z>1, deep surveys are needed to probe typical (L∗ and fainter) luminosities and to directly detect the majority of cosmic star formations. In principle, many fields have suitable data. However, in practice, a few survey fields have been reanalyzed many times, in part because they have the best spectroscopic and photometric redshift measurements and in part because they have the richest multiwavelength data. As such, they are magnets for studies of all kinds. In the UV, the 1,500-Å rest frame is easily probed at z>1.5 using ground-based or HST optical imaging. At z≈2 and 3, the surveys of LBGs by Steidel and collaborators (e.g., Reddy & Steidel 2009) cover many independent sightlines. They offer excellent control of cosmic variance and have outstanding spectroscopic calibration. UV selection is biased against dusty star formation, but for pure measurements of the UVLF, their surveys are arguably definitive. The best direct measurements of dust emission from Spitzer and Herschel are limited to fewer fields, and still fewer have the very deep data needed to probe galaxies near L∗. As described above, most analysis has revolved around GOODS and COSMOS, and even in GOODS, the Herschel data only barely reach L∗ at z = 2. The faint-end slope of the IRLF is not directly constrained by individually detected sources at z>2, leading to potentially large uncertainties in any extrapolation to the bolometric IR luminosity density. With no more sensitive FIR space missions on the horizon, there is little prospect for wide-area surveys to fainter flux limits. ALMA can reach fainter submillimeter continuum limits and detect dust continuum from ordinary galaxies at very high redshifts, but only for very small solid angles. Mosaics of hundreds or even thousands of pointings would be needed to survey a field the size of GOODS. Well-designed observations targeting intelligently selected galaxy samples, rather than panoramic mapping, may be required.',\n",
       "  'Stellar masses below the characteristic mass M∗ can be probed using the best ground-based NIR data and using Spitzer IRAC even with modest integration times. Thus, more fields have been analyzed, although GOODS and COSMOS still tend to dominate the literature. The extended Spitzer warm mission generated a wealth of valuable data that has yet to be fully exploited. In practice, there is uncannily good agreement between most determinations of the SMF and density at 1<z<4, and it is not clear that new surveys are needed, rather than more sophisticated analysis of the existing data. However, the CANDELS HST WFC3 survey reaches fainter multiband NIR fluxes in fields that already have the deepest IRAC data and, hence, provides an important opportunity for measuring photometric redshifts and stellar masses for galaxies fainter than the limits of most studies to date. This should provide a better constraint on the slope of the SMF at low masses.',\n",
       "  'At z⩾4, the large majority of UV-based SFR and SMD measurements have been derived from HST data, mainly in the GOODS fields and the HUDF plus its deep parallel fields (also located in and around GOODS-South). Although ground-based imaging can select galaxies at z⩾4, in practice the HST surveys have gone deeper, especially at the very red optical wavelengths (I- and z-bands) and the NIR wavelengths needed to select galaxies at the highest redshifts; only with these data can LF measurements probe significantly fainter than L∗. GOODS also has the deepest Spitzer IRAC data, essential for deriving stellar masses at z>4, where even the K-band samples rest-frame UV wavelengths. Although the comoving volumes in the GOODS fields are significant at these large redshifts (nearly 106 comoving Mpc3 at z = 4 for the combined GOODS fields), one may still worry about clustering and cosmic variance, given only two sightlines. The CANDELS program (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011) is obtaining multiband optical and NIR HST imaging over five fields, each similar in size, including the two GOODS fields. This program is supplemented by very deep IRAC imaging from SEDS (Ashby et al. 2013) and S-CANDELS (G. Fazio, research in progress) and will help with cosmic variance control and improved statistics.',\n",
       "  'At 68, the HUDF (or lensing clusters) are needed to detect convincing candidates. Hence, nearly all the literature on the SFRD or stellar masses at these redshifts consists of serial and parallel analyses of the same HUDF data sets as well as recent work from CLASH (Zheng et al. 2012, Coe et al. 2013). Here, the new Hubble Frontier Fields should be important. This program, to be executed from 2013 to 2016, will obtain multiband optical and NIR HST imaging with near-HUDF depth along with ultradeep Spitzer IRAC data for six massive galaxy clusters. Its lensing potential will magnify the faintest high-redshift background galaxies. In addition, there will be six new “blank” parallel fields that will improve statistics for unlensed sources and provide cosmic variance control for analyses that now depend on the HUDF (and its satellites) alone.',\n",

Massive galaxies with huge SFRs that are detected at submillimeter wavelengths but invisible even out to the K-band have been detected. Redshifts z>4 have been confirmed from CO measurements (e.g., Daddi et al. 2009), but it is unknown how much they might contribute to the SFR or SMD. IRAC selection should, in principle, provide a less biased census (e.g., Mancini et al. 2009; Huang et al. 2011; Caputi et al. 2011, 2012), but spectroscopic confirmation or even photometric redshift estimates for this population may prove to be very difficult before the launch of the JWST.',\n",

For most of the data shown in \\nFigure 8\\n, the attenuation has been estimated from the UV spectral slopes of star-forming galaxies using the attenuation-reddening relations from Meurer et al. (1999) or Calzetti et al. (2000) or occasionally from stellar population model fitting to the full UV-optical SEDs of galaxies integrated over the observed population (e.g., Salim et al. 2007, Cucciati et al. 2012). Robotham & Driver (2011) used the empirical attenuation correction of Driver et al. (2008). We note that the estimates of UV attenuation in the local Universe span a broad range, suggesting that more work needs to be done to firmly pin down this quantity (and perhaps implying that we should be cautious about the estimates at higher redshift). Several studies of UV-selected galaxies at z⩾2 (Reddy & Steidel 2009, Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012b) have noted strong trends for less luminous galaxies as having bluer UV spectral slopes and, hence, lower inferred dust attenuation. Because the faint-end slope of the far-UV luminosity function (FUVLF) is so steep at high redshift, a large fraction of the reddened FUV luminosity density is emitted by galaxies much fainter than L∗; this extinction-luminosity trend also implies that the net extinction for the entire population will be a function of the faint integration limit for the sample.

The net attenuation for the brighter limit, which more closely represents the sample of galaxies actually observed in the study, is significantly larger than for the extrapolation—nearly two times larger for the Reddy & Steidel (2009) samples and by a lesser factor for the more distant objects from Bouwens et al.

(2012) and Herschel FIRLFs from Gruppioni et al. (2013). At z<2, these estimates agree reasonably well with the measurements inferred from the UV slope or from SED fitting. At z>2, the FIR/FUV estimates have large uncertainties owing to the similarly large uncertainties required to extrapolate the observed FIRLFs to a total luminosity density. The values are larger than those for the UV-selected surveys, particularly when compared with the UV values extrapolated to very faint luminosities. Although galaxies with lower SFRs may have reduced extinction, purely UV-selected samples at high redshift may also be biased against dusty star-forming galaxies. As we noted above, a robust census for star-forming galaxies at z≫2 selected on the basis of dust emission alone does not exist, owing to the sensitivity limits of past and present FIR and submillimeter observatories. Accordingly, the total amount of star formation that is missed from UV surveys at such high redshifts remains uncertain.',\n",

These should not be taken too literally, especially when there is significant difference in the faint-end slopes of LFs reported in different studies, which can lead to large differences in the integrated luminosity density. Uncertainties in the faint-end slope and the resulting extrapolations are not always fully taken into account in published error analyses, especially when LFs are fit at high redshift by fixing the slope to some value measured only at lower redshift.',\n",

Stellar mass completeness at any given redshift is rarely as well defined as luminosity completeness, given the broad range of M/L values that galaxies can exhibit. Unlike the LFs used for the SFRD calculations where we have tried to impose a consistent faint luminosity limit (relative to L∗) for integration, in most cases we have simply accepted whatever low-mass limits or integral values that the various authors reported. Many authors found that the characteristic mass M∗ appears to change little for 0<z<3 (e.g., Fontana et al. 2006, Ilbert et al. 2013) and is roughly 1011M⊙ (Salpeter). Therefore, a low-mass integration limit similar to that which we used for the LFs (L\\nmin=0.03L∗) would correspond to M\\nmin≈109.5M⊙ in that redshift range.

One can imagine several possible causes for this discrepancy; we consider several of them here.',\n",
       "  'SFRs may be overestimated, particularly at high redshift during the peak era of galaxy growth. For UV-based measurements, a likely culprit may be the luminosity-weighted dust corrections, which could be too large, although it is often asserted that UV data are likely to underestimate SFRs in very dusty, luminous galaxies. IR-based SFRs may be overestimated and indeed were overestimated for some high-redshift galaxies in earlier Spitzer studies, although this seems less likely now in the era of deep Herschel FIR measurements. It seems more plausible that the SFRs inferred for individual galaxies may be correct on average but that the LF extrapolations could be too large. Many authors adopt fairly steep (α⩾−1.6) faint-end slopes to both the UVLFs and IRLFs for distant galaxies. For the UVLFs, the best modern data constrain these slopes quite well, but in the IR current measurements are not deep enough to do so. However, although these extrapolations may be uncertain, the good agreement between the current best estimates of the UV- and IR-based SFRDs at 0<z<2.5 (\\nFigure 9\\n) does not clearly point to a problem in either one.',\n",
       "  'Instead, stellar masses or their integrated SMD may be systematically underestimated. This is not implausible, particularly for star-forming galaxies, where the problem of recent star formation “outshining” older high-M/L stars is well known (see Section 5.1). By analyzing mock catalogs of galaxies drawn from simulations with realistic (and complex) SFHs, Pforr et al. (2012) found that the simplifying assumptions that are typically made when modeling stellar masses for real surveys generally lead to systematically underestimated stellar masses at all redshifts. That said, other systematic effects can work in the opposite direction and lead to mass overestimates, e.g., the effects of TP-AGB stars on the red and NIR light if these are not correctly modeled (Maraston 2005). A steeper low-mass slope to the GSMF could also increase the total SMD. This has been suggested even at z = 0, where mass functions have been measured with seemingly great precision and dynamic range (e.g., Baldry et al. 2008). At high redshift, most studies to date have found relatively flat low-mass SMF slopes, but galaxy samples may be incomplete (and photometric redshift estimates poor) for very faint, red, high-M/L galaxies if they exist in significant numbers. Some recent SMF determinations using very deep HST WFC3 observations have found steeper SMF slopes at z>1.5 (e.g., Santini et al. 2012), and new measurements from extremely deep NIR surveys such as CANDELS are eagerly anticipated. That said, it seems unlikely that the SMF slope at low redshift has been underestimated enough to account for a difference of 0.2 dex in the SMD.',\n",

Therefore, following Stark et al. (2013), we have divided the SMD of González et al.

       "  'Alternatively, some authors have considered how changing the IMF may help reconcile SMD(z) with the time-integrated SFRD(z) (e.g., Wilkins et al. 2008b). Generally, a more top-heavy or bottom-light IMF will lead to larger luminosities per unit SFR, hence smaller SFR/L conversion factors K (Section 3.1). Mass-to-light ratios for older stellar populations will also tend to be smaller, but not necessarily by the same factor. Although we have used a Salpeter IMF for reference in this review, an IMF with a low-mass turnover (e.g., Chabrier or Kroupa) will yield a larger mass return fraction R and proportionately lower final stellar masses for a given integrated past SFH by the factor (1−R\\n1)/(1−R\\n2)=0.81, where R\\n1 and R\\n2=0.41 and 0.27 for the Chabrier and Salpeter IMFs, respectively (Section 2). The apparent offset between the SMD data and our integrated model ψ(z) can be reduced further to only ∼0.1 dex without invoking a particularly unusual IMF. Given the remaining potential for systemic uncertainties in the measurements of SFRDs and SMDs, it seems premature to tinker further with the IMF, although if discrepancies remain after further improvements in the measurements and modeling then this topic may be worth revisiting.',\n",
       "  'In concordance with estimates from the cosmic SFH, the measurements of the SMD discussed above imply that galaxies formed the bulk (≳75%) of their stellar mass at z<2. Stars formed in galaxies before 11.5 Gyr are predicted to contribute only 8% of the total stellar mass today. An important consistency check for all these determinations could come from studies of the past SFH of the Universe from its present contents. This “fossil cosmology” approach has benefited from large spectroscopic surveys in the local Universe such as the 2dFGRS (Colless et al. 2001) and the SDSS (York et al. 2000), which provide detailed spectral information for hundreds of thousands of galaxies. Using a sample of 1.7×105 galaxies drawn from the SDSS DR2 and comparing the spectrum of each galaxy to a library of templates by Bruzual & Charlot (2003) (the comparison was based on five spectral absorption features, namely D4,000, Hβ, and HδA+HγA as age-sensitive indexes and [Mg2Fe] and [MgFe]′ as metal-sensitive indexes), Gallazzi et al. (2008) have constructed a distribution of stellar mass as a function of age (for a similar analysis on the SDSS DR3 sample, see also Panter et al. 2007).

The SDSS distribution, however, appears to be skewed toward younger ages. This is partly caused by a bias toward younger populations in the SDSS “archaeological” approach, where individual galaxies are assigned only an average (weighted by mass or light) age that is closer to the last significant episode of star formation. Such bias appears to be reflected in \\nFigure 12\\n where the mass assembly history predicted by our model SFH is compared with that inferred by translating the characteristic age of the stellar populations measured by Gallazzi et al.

The agreement is generally good, although the SDSS distribution would predict later star formation and more rapid SMD growth at z<2 and correspondingly less stellar mass formed at z>2. The present-day total SMD derived by Gallazzi et al.

       "  'In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the sSFR (sSFR≡SFR/M∗) of galaxies with different masses at different times in the history of the Universe. The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M∗, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M∗ correlation. For the “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a “downsizing” picture first introduced by Cowie et al. (1996). Dwarf galaxies continue to undergo major episodes of activity. The tightness of this SFR-M∗ correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH. Starburst galaxies, whose SFRs are significantly elevated above the main-sequence correlation, contribute only a small fraction of the global SFRD at z⩽2 (Rodighiero et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2012). Instead, the evolution of the cosmic SFR is primarily due to the steadily evolving properties of main-sequence disk galaxies.',\n",

At z<2, the globally averaged sSFR (≡ψ/ρ∗) declines more steeply than does that for the star-forming population, as star formation is “quenched” for an increasingly large fraction of the galaxy population. These passive galaxies are represented in the global sSFR, but not in the sSFR of the star-forming “main sequence.” Previous derivations showed a nearly constant sSFR of ∼2 Gyr-1 for galaxies in the redshift range 2<z<7, suggesting relatively inefficient early star formation and exponential growth in SFRs and stellar masses with cosmic time. Recent estimates of reduced stellar masses were derived after correcting for nebular emission in broadband photometry and appear to require some evolution in the high-z sSFR (Stark et al. 2013, González et al. 2014). At these epochs, the global sSFR decreases with increasing cosmic time t as sSFR ∼4/t Gyr-1, a consequence of the power-law scaling of our SFRD, ψ(t)∝t\\n1.9.\\n',\n",

The damped Lyα absorption systems are detected in absorption (i.e., have no luminosity bias), and their large optical depths at the Lyman limit eliminate the need for uncertain ionization corrections to deduce metal abundances. Their metallicity is determined with the highest confidence from elements such as O, S, Si, Zn, and Fe and decreases with increasing redshift down to ≈1/600 solar to z∼5 (e.g., Rafelski et al. 2012). The enrichment of the circumgalactic medium, as probed in absorption by Ciii, Civ, Siiii, Siiv, Ovi, and other transitions, provides us with a record of past star formation and of the impact of galactic winds on their surroundings. \\nFigure 14\\n shows that the ionization-corrected metal abundances from Ovi absorption at z∼3 (Aguirre et al. 2008) and Civ absorption at z∼4 (Simcoe 2011) track well the predicted mean metallicity of the Universe, i.e., that these systems are an unbiased probe of the cosmic baryon cycle.',\n",

Here, we use recent surveys of high- and low-ionization intergalactic absorption to estimate the metallicity of the Universe at these extreme redshifts. According to Simcoe et al.

It is then relatively straightforward to link a given IGM metallicity to the minimum number of LyC photons that must have been produced up until that time. The close correspondence between the sources of metals and photons makes the conversion from one to the other largely independent of the details of the stellar IMF (Madau & Shull 1996).

An average energy of 22 eV per LyC photon together with our prediction of Zb\\n=7×10−4Z⊙ (assuming a solar yield) at redshift 6 implies that approximately 8 LyC photons per baryon were emitted by early galaxies prior to this epoch. Although at least one photon per baryon is needed for reionization to occur, this is a reasonable value because the effect of hydrogen recombinations in the IGM and within individual halos will likely boost the number of photons required. A global metallicity at z = 6 that was much lower than our predicted value would effectively create a deficit of UV radiation and leave the reionization of the IGM unexplained.

Delvecchio et al. (2014) have used deep Herschel and Spitzer survey data in GOODS-S and COSMOS to identify AGN by SED fitting. This is a potentially powerful method but depends on reliable decomposition of the IR emission from AGN and star formation.\\n',\n",

       "  'Fundamental to our understanding of how the Universe evolved to its present state is the epoch of “first light,” the first billion years after the Big Bang when the collapse of the earliest baryonic objects—the elementary building blocks for the more massive systems that formed later—determined the “initial conditions” of the cosmological structure formation process. The reionization in the all-pervading IGM—the transformation of neutral hydrogen into an ionized state—is a landmark event in the history of the early Universe. Studies of Lyα absorption in the spectra of distant quasars show that the IGM is highly photoionized out to redshift z≳6 (for a review, see Fan et al. 2006), whereas polarization data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe constrain the redshift of any sudden reionization event to be significantly higher, z = 10.5 ± 1.2 (Jarosik et al. 2011). It is generally thought that the IGM is kept ionized by the integrated UV emission from AGN and star-forming galaxies, but the relative contributions of these sources as a function of epoch are poorly known (e.g., Madau et al. 1999, Faucher-Giguère et al. 2008, Haardt & Madau 2012, Robertson et al. 2013).',\n",

Although the mechanisms regulating the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from galaxies and its dependence on cosmic time and luminosity are unknown, these leakage values are higher than typically inferred from observations of LBGs at z∼3 (e.g., Nestor et al. 2013, Vanzella et al. 2012, and references therein).',\n",

Second, the rest-frame UV continuum properties of very high redshift galaxies appear to show little evidence for the “exotic” stellar populations (e.g., extremely subsolar metallicities or top-heavy IMFs) that would significantly boost the LyC photon yield (e.g., Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013). Although improved knowledge of the SFRD beyond redshift 9 may help to better characterize this photon shortfall, the prospects of a direct observational determination of the escape fraction of ionizing photons leaking into the IGM at these early epochs look rather bleak, as the Universe becomes opaque to LyC radiation above redshift 4.',\n",
       "  \"The cosmic history of star formation is one of the most fundamental observables in astrophysical cosmology. We have reviewed the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that are allowing astronomers to map the transformation of gas into stars, the production of heavy elements, and the reionization of the Universe from the cosmic dark ages to the present epoch. Under the simple assumption of a universal IMF, there is reasonable agreement between the global SMD inferred at any particular time and the time integral of all the preceding instantaneous star-formation activity, although modest offsets may still point toward systematic uncertainties. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the SFRD peaked ∼3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang and dropped exponentially at z<1 with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. The Universe was a much more active place in the past: Stars formed at a peak rate approximately nine times higher than is seen today. Approximately 25% of the present-day SMD formed at z>2, before the peak of the SFRD, and another 25% formed since z = 0.7, i.e., roughly over the last half of the Universe's age. From the peak of the SFRD at z≈2 to the present day, and perhaps earlier as well, most stars formed in galaxies that obey a relatively tight SFR-M∗ correlation, and only a small fraction formed in starbursts with significantly elevated specific SFRs. The smooth evolution of this dominant main-sequence galaxy population suggests that the evolution of the cosmic SFH is primarily determined by a balance between gas accretion and feedback processes, both closely related to galaxy mass, and that stochastic events such as merger-driven starbursts play a relatively minor role. The growth histories of the stellar component of galaxies and their central black holes are similar in shape, suggesting broad coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to 0.001 solar by redshift six, 1 Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than 10 hydrogen LyC photons per baryon, indicating a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization. The SFRD at z≈7 was approximately the same as that of today, at z≈0, but only 1% of today's SMD was formed during the epoch of reionization.\",\n",
       "  'As far as the observations and data are concerned, there is still room for improvement in both SFRD and SMD measurements at virtually every redshift, from the local Universe to the epoch of reionization (Section 4.6). That said, it would be somewhat surprising if new measurements changed the picture dramatically at z<1; it is more likely that stellar population modeling, e.g., for deriving stellar masses or SFRs, could still change the details of the picture during the decline and fall of the cosmic SFH. Indeed, at all redshifts, limitations of our methods for interpreting light as mass may play a significant, even dominant, role in the error budget for the analyses described in this review. The peak era of cosmic star formation has been extensively mapped, and yet even with the current data (\\nFigure 9\\n), it is still hard to accurately pinpoint the redshift of maximum SFRD within a range Δz=1. Our fitting function (Equation 15) places this peak at z≈1.85, which is plausible but still uncertain. Uncertainties in the faint-end slope of the IRLF and in extinction corrections for the UVLF still dominate at this peak era of cosmic star formation. Although evidence seems to point clearly to a steady increase in the SFRD from z = 8 to z≈2, our direct knowledge of dust-obscured star formation at these redshifts is, for the most part, limited to the rarest and most ultraluminous galaxies, leaving considerable uncertainty about how much SFRD we may be missing in the UV census of that early phase of galaxy evolution. At z>4, our galaxy surveys have been strongly biased toward UV-bright galaxies and may underestimate both SFRDs and SMDs. Even for UV-selected galaxies, the measurements at z⩾8 are very new and likely uncertain, unsupported by spectroscopic confirmation to date. In addition to measuring redshifts, spectroscopy from the JWST will help clarify basic issues about nebular line emission and the degree to which it has affected the photometric analyses that have been carried out to date.',\n",
       "  'Painstaking though all this vast effort has been, it does miss a crucial point. It says little about the inner workings of galaxies, i.e., their “metabolism” and the basic process of ingestion (gas infall and cooling), digestion (star formation), and excretion (outflows). Ultimately, it also says little about the mapping from dark matter halos to their baryonic components. Its roots are in optical-IR astronomy, statistics, stellar populations, and phenomenology, rather than in the physics of the ISM, self-regulated accretion and star formation, stellar feedback, and SN-driven galactic winds. It provides a benchmark against which to compare semianalytic modeling and hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, but it offers little guidance in identifying the smaller-scale basic mechanisms that determine the rate of conversion of gas into stars and lead to the grandiose events in the history of the Universe described in this review.',\n",
       "  \"A variety of physical processes are thought to shape the observed distribution of galaxy properties, ranging from those responsible for galaxy growth (e.g., star formation and galaxy merging) to those that regulate such growth (e.g., energetic feedback from SNe, AGN, and the UV radiation background). However, many of these processes likely depend primarily on the mass of a galaxy's dark matter halo. Relating the stellar masses and SFRs of galaxies to the masses and assembly histories of their parent halos is a crucial piece of the galaxy formation and evolution puzzle. With the accumulation of data from large surveys and from cosmological numerical simulations, several statistical methods have been developed over the past decade to link the properties of galaxies to the underlying dark matter structures (e.g., Berlind & Weinberg 2002, Yang et al. 2003, Vale & Ostriker 2004). One of them, the “abundance matching” technique, assumes in its simplest form a unique and monotonic relation between galaxy light and halo mass, and it reproduces galaxy clustering as a function of luminosity over a wide range in redshift (e.g., Conroy et al. 2006, Guo et al. 2010, Moster et al. 2010). Modern versions of this approach (Behroozi et al. 2013, Moster et al. 2013) have shown that (a) halos of mass ∼1012M⊙ are the most efficient at forming stars at every epoch, with baryon conversion efficiencies of 20–40% that fall rapidly at both higher and lower masses; (b) in halos similar to that of the Milky Way, approximately half of the central stellar mass is assembled after redshift 0.7; and (c) in low-mass halos, the accretion of satellites contributes little to the assembly of their central galaxies, whereas in massive halos more than half of the central stellar mass is formed “ex situ.” These studies represent promising advances, albeit with serious potential shortcomings (e.g., Guo & White 2013, Zentner et al. 2013). The assumption of a monotonic relation between stellar mass and the mass of the host halo is likely incorrect in detail, and it predicts only numerically converged properties on scales that are well resolved in simulations. The matching procedure requires minimal assumptions and avoids an explicit treatment of the physics of galaxy formation. As such, it provides relatively little new insight into this physics. In the version of this technique by Behroozi et al. (2013), for example, the cosmic SFH is reproduced by construction.\",\n",
       "  'As of this writing, a solid interpretation of the cosmic SFH from first principles is still missing (for a recent review, see Mac Low 2013). Generically, one expects that star formation may be limited at early times by the build-up of dark matter halos and quenched at low redshift as densities decline from Hubble expansion to the point where gas cooling is inhibited. These two regimes could then lead to a peak in the SFH at intermediate redshifts (Hernquist & Springel 2003). A decade ago, hydrodynamical simulations predicted that the peak in star-formation activity should occur at a much higher redshift, z≳5, than is actually observed (Springel & Hernquist 2003, Nagamine et al. 2004). Theoretical modeling has been unable to correctly forecast the evolution of the SFRD because of the large range of galaxy masses that contribute significantly to cosmic star formation and the difficulty in following the feedback of energy into the ISM and circumgalactic medium from stellar radiation, SN explosions, and accreting massive black holes. Gas cooling in an expanding Universe is an intrinsically unstable process because cooling acts to increase the density of the gas, which in turn increases the cooling rate. Systems collapsing at low redshift have low mean densities and long cooling times, whereas systems collapsing at higher redshifts have higher mean densities and cool catastrophically. Without feedback processes that transfer energy to the ISM and reheat it, one is faced with the classical overcooling problem—the unphysical cooling of hot gas in the poorly resolved inner regions of galaxies—and with the consequent overproduction of stars at early times. And yet, a completely satisfactory treatment of feedback in hydrodynamical simulations that capture large cosmological volumes remains elusive, as these mechanisms operate on scales too small to be resolved and must therefore be incorporated via ad hoc recipes that are too simplistic to capture the complex subgrid physics involved (e.g., Schaye et al. 2009).',\n",
       "  'In-depth knowledge of the mechanisms responsible for suppressing star formation in small halos (e.g., Governato et al. 2010, Krumholz & Dekel 2012, Kuhlen et al. 2012), more powerful supercomputers, better algorithms, as well as more robust numerical implementations of stellar feedback (e.g., Agertz et al. 2013) all now appear as crucial prerequisites for predicting more realistic SFHs. Newer and deeper observations from the ground and space should improve our measurements of the galaxy population and its integrated properties, especially at and beyond the current redshift frontier where data remain sparse. It seems likely, however, that the most important contribution of new surveys and better modeling will be toward a detailed understanding of the physics of galaxy evolution, not simply its demographics.',\n",

The central question of this review is whether we can find evidence for these IMBHs. The corollary is whether, based on the mass distributions and environments of the black holes, we can determine how these IMBHs were formed.

Furthermore, ongoing and future time-domain surveys are detecting more and more tidal disruption events (TDEs).

The emergent spectrum of such sources is of interest not only for understanding accretion but also in thinking about the impact of mini-quasars on the formation of the first galaxies and the reionization of the Universe (e.g., Madau & Haardt 2015).

       " 'The growth of supermassive black hole seeds and the existence of IMBHs have both long been discussed in the literature, even before we were completely sure of the existence of astrophysical black holes (e.g., Eardley & Press 1975). Quickly thereafter, the community developed theoretical ideas about how one might form non-stellar-mass black holes; the famous diagram from Rees (1978) includes all the formation mechanisms we consider today, including gravitational runaway (Bahcall & Ostriker 1975, Begelman & Rees 1978, Quinlan & Shapiro 1990, Lee 1993), the collapse of Population III (Pop III) stars (e.g., Bond et al. 1984, Madau & Rees 2001), and the idea of a direct collapse into a black hole (e.g., Haehnelt & Rees 1993, Loeb & Rasio 1994, Koushiappas et al. 2004). There was also early interest in IMBHs as a possible explanation for dark matter (e.g., Lacey & Ostriker 1985, Carr 1994), although there are now many limits on black holes as dark matter (e.g., Tisserand et al. 2007, Ali-Haïmoud et al. 2017, Zumalacárregui & Seljak 2018).',\n",

Accordingly, theoretical work identified that local observations of black holes in dwarf galaxies, which suffer fewer mergers and less accretion, may provide an additional key to understanding seeding processes (e.g., Volonteri et al. 2008).',\n",
       " 'In parallel, the Einstein Telescope enabled the discovery of the first ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs; e.g., Long et al. 1981, Fabbiano 1989), whose luminosities are nominally above the Eddington limit for compact stellar objects. One natural explanation for the high X-ray luminosities of these sources is that they are powered by more massive compact objects, namely IMBHs (e.g., Kaaret et al. 2017, and references therein; Section 4). The ULXs show association with young star clusters and this spurred continuing interest in the formation of IMBHs in dense stellar clusters through gravitational runaway (e.g., Ebisuzaki et al. 2001, Miller & Hamilton 2002, Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002). Puzzling suggestions of abnormal numbers of young stars in the Galactic Center also sparked interest in a possible IMBH to carry in the stars (e.g., Ghez et al. 2003, Hansen & Milosavljević 2003).',\n",

Early dynamical searches for black holes in the nuclei of low-mass galaxies also reported nondetections (Gebhardt et al. 2001, Valluri et al. 2004). Comprehensive searches for AGN signatures in nearby galaxies likewise pointed to a low fraction of AGNs in late-type and low-mass galaxies (e.g., Ho et al. 1997, Kauffmann et al. 2003). These facts together led the community to conclude that black holes are rarely found in the nuclei of <1010 M⊙ galaxies (i.e., galaxies less massive than the Milky Way).

       " 'We know that black holes are made in the deaths of massive stars. This process happens at the present day, but at early times we expect theoretically that the first (so-called Pop III) stars were quite massive, due to the inability of molecular hydrogen gas to cool (Bromm & Larson 2004, Karlsson et al. 2013, and references therein). Such massive stars would likely end their lives as black holes with M\\nBH ∼ 100 M⊙ (e.g., Fryer et al. 2001), excepting first stars in the mass range of 140–260 M⊙ that would explode as pair-instability supernovae and leave no remnant (Heger et al. 2003). As shown by Madau & Rees (2001), if these first massive stars are rare, such that only about one is made in each high-density peak at very high redshift, then the number density of black holes would be well matched to the number of supermassive black holes today. However, growing from ∼100 M⊙ to a billion Suns in a fraction of a gigayear requires dramatic fueling (Haiman & Loeb 2001). Specifically, for a typical e-folding time of 45 million years, 14 such e-foldings are available at z = 7, but 17 are needed if the black hole grows at the Eddington limit (Madau et al. 2014, and references therein). Arranging this uninterrupted growth seems challenging even for these rare quasars (e.g., Johnson & Bromm 2007, Milosavljević et al. 2009). However, a few episodes of super-Eddington accretion could largely alleviate the tension, and super-Eddington accretion now appears to arise naturally in numerical experiments (e.g., Jiang et al. 2019).',\n",
       " 'A different channel, with no local analogs, is that of collapsing gas clouds forming a massive seed black hole without passing through all the phases of stellar evolution. These direct-collapse models form seed black holes with M\\nBH ∼ 104–106 M⊙ (e.g., Loeb & Rasio 1994, Bromm & Loeb 2003, Begelman et al. 2006, Lodato & Natarajan 2006), which perhaps pass through a quasi-star phase (e.g., Begelman 2010). This channel can only operate at very high redshift, because pristine gas is required to suppress cooling and fragmentation. Recent literature discusses in detail how rare the conditions may be to ensure that the gas does not cool and fragment into smaller units (e.g., Visbal et al. 2014, Habouzit et al. 2016), typically assuming that an elevated Lyman–Werner background is needed (e.g., Omukai 2001). Some works instead argue that additional photons from star formation in nearby halos (e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2008, Visbal et al. 2014), additional gas heating through mergers (Yoshida et al. 2003, Wise et al. 2019), or even star formation within individual halos (Dunn et al. 2018), may provide sufficient heating or ionizing photons to make this channel viable. We emphasize that the number density of halos that suffer direct collapse is very uncertain, with predictions differing on the halo gas accretion rates as a function of mass, the required elevation of the ionizing background, and the possible sources of ionizing photons. See the comprehensive review by Inayoshi et al. (2020, in this volume).',\n",
       " 'A final class of models generates ∼103–104 M⊙ black holes in a gravitational runaway event within a dense stellar cluster. Modern discussion divides globular cluster IMBH formation scenarios into slow and fast versions, depending on whether the formation occurs over ∼100 Myr to 1 Gyr or less than around a few million years, respectively. Here, we focus specifically on the formation of the seed at the centers of dense clusters. In any scenario in which an IMBH does form, the present-day mass may well be higher due to accretion of gas and/or stars (e.g., Rosswog et al. 2009, MacLeod et al. 2016a, Sakurai et al. 2017; Section 9). We also note that though normal single stars are not expected to produce black holes >100 M⊙, it is plausible that repeated mergers in star clusters could occasionally produce IMBHs larger than 100 M⊙ by this channel (Rodriguez et al. 2019).',\n",
       " 'The modern incarnation of the slow scenario (Miller & Hamilton 2002) envisions a black hole of mass \\n\\n50 M⊙ forming as the remnant of a massive star, then growing through mergers of mass-segregated black holes, and leading to ∼103M⊙ IMBHs in a few \\n\\n of massive globular clusters. In this scenario, the occupation fraction is set by considering the central densities observed in Galactic globular clusters. Lower-mass (∼10–20M⊙) black hole seeds will not lead to a runaway because early stellar interactions tend to eject these lighter black holes from the cluster. A governing uncertainty in this scenario is whether even 50-M⊙ seeds can form, as such remnants might be rare or absent in single-star evolution (Woosley 2017).',\n",
       " 'The fast scenario was reintroduced in a contemporary form by Portegies Zwart & McMillan (2002), who used a combination of simulations and analytic calculations to argue that sufficiently dense star clusters undergo a collisional runaway of massive stars, the product of which could eventually lead to the formation of an IMBH. Such supermassive stars could potentially also produce enough ejected material with unusual abundances to explain the multiple stellar populations seen in globular clusters (Gieles et al. 2018b). Both this scenario and the direct-collapse scenario may be sensitive to metallicity: at high metallicity, stellar winds may remove so much mass that collapse to a black hole is uncertain (e.g., Mapelli 2016). In the context of very low metallicity and very high redshift, some models predict that very dense and massive clusters may form black holes at their centers (e.g., Devecchi & Volonteri 2009, Katz et al. 2015, Sakurai et al. 2017). Although clusters this dense are not found at lower redshift, hypothetical Pop III star clusters could optimistically be detectable with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).',\n",
       " 'Currently it is challenging to compare predictions of local demographics based on the seeding mechanism. To that end, we gather approximate predicted number densities and mass distributions of present-day IMBH populations as a function of channel and modeling approach. Even with perfect knowledge of the number density and halo locations of black hole seeds at early times, there are many unknown factors at play as the seeds evolve toward the present day (e.g., Volonteri et al. 2008, Volonteri 2010, Mezcua 2017, Buchner et al. 2019, Mezcua et al. 2019). We outline some of these uncertainties and then compare the predictions from different types of models.',\n",
       " 'When galaxies merge, the central black holes may also merge, and any differences in the mass and angular momentum of the two black holes can translate into anisotropic gravitational wave emission during the merger, which in turn can impart a linear momentum kick to the merged remnant (e.g., Redmount & Rees 1989). A major uncertainty in going from initial seed models to local observations of black holes in galaxy nuclei comes from the unknown fraction of black holes that are ejected via gravitational recoil. These kicks may be more than sufficient to exceed the escape velocity of low-mass halos (e.g., Haiman 2004, Campanelli et al. 2007), but the most common mergers with much lower-mass black hole secondaries likely never lead to recoil (Volonteri & Rees 2006). In practice, the distribution of kick velocities depends on the mass ratios and relative spins of the incoming black holes, for which we do not have complete models. There are other dynamical uncertainties to consider. Such low-mass black holes in such shallow potentials may never settle at the centers of their galaxies (Bellovary et al. 2019). Away from the center of the potential, the black holes may not grow efficiently, and would likely be missed with current searches (although see Barrows et al. 2019, Reines et al. 2019).',\n",
       " 'Finally, tracking accretion in a physically motivated way requires prohibitively high spatial resolution for cosmological simulations. In particular, if super-Eddington accretion is possible, then the differences between the Pop III channel and the direct-collapse channel may be washed out at early times (e.g., Volonteri & Gnedin 2009, Alexander & Natarajan 2014). Thus, it is possible that the high-redshift luminosity function and number of gravitational wave detections from growing black holes may be more sensitive to seeding (e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Tanaka & Haiman 2009). Furthermore, late-time growth contributes in an unconstrained way to the present-day black hole mass distribution. Nuclear star clusters, the hosts of at least some candidate IMBHs (Section 3), experience multiple bursts of star formation (e.g., Walcher et al. 2006, Carson et al. 2015, Kacharov et al. 2018). Such bursts may well feed the black hole, and additional accretion via stellar interactions may also occur (e.g., Alexander & Bar-Or 2017, Stone et al. 2017).',\n",

As described above, the direct-collapse scenario requires finely tuned conditions.

Two approaches have been taken to predict the observable signatures of seeding mechanisms on the black hole population today, semianalytic modeling and hydrodynamic simulations.',\n",
       " 'Semianalytic modeling (Volonteri et al. 2008) can quickly track the evolution of black holes using merger trees and explore the dependence on all the uncertain accretion and merging prescriptions (see also Volonteri & Natarajan 2009, van Wassenhove et al. 2010). Most of the semianalytic models in the literature that compare Pop III stars and heavy seeds adopt the heavy seeding model of Lodato & Natarajan (2006), which predicts a high number density of heavy seeds ∼0.1 Mpc−3 (Volonteri 2010), as compared to ∼10−4 Mpc−3 quoted by Inayoshi et al. (2020, in this volume). Thus, these are optimistic scenarios for heavy seeds and likely depend in detail on the assumed ionizing background (e.g., Valiante et al. 2016). Recently, Bellovary et al. (2019) also used zoom-in hydrodynamical simulations to track seeds to the present day as formed in high redshift via a direct-collapse scenario (Dunn et al. 2018). We take the recent work by Ricarte & Natarajan (2018) as representative of the semianalytic approach, because they consider a range of fueling mechanisms. The two have comparable predicted occupation fractions in the context of direct collapse. However, Ricarte & Natarajan find a very wide range of acceptable occupation fractions for the Pop III channel (see also Section 9). We note that according to predictions from both models, the occupation fraction starts to change dramatically below galaxy host masses of 109 M⊙, a regime that is not yet empirically constrained.',\n",
       " 'We translate these occupation fractions into number densities for the two channels (\\nTable 1\\n). To convert the occupation fractions into number-density predictions, we take a galaxy stellar-mass function (Wright et al. 2017) and integrate from 107–1010 M⊙, incorporating the range of occupation fractions presented in \\nTable 1\\n. Note that we have observational constraints only down to 109 M⊙, and so these predictions represent a significant extrapolation but are consistent with existing observations in all cases. These numbers are also roughly consistent with the numbers quoted by Volonteri (2010), which again rely on the optimistic direct-collapse channel from Lodato & Natarajan (2006). Although mass distributions may differ between the two, the full range of predicted occupation fractions for the direct-collapse and Pop III channels are quite similar. We emphasize that the accretion history will be tracked eventually with active galaxy luminosity functions (e.g., Civano et al. 2019), which should provide additional constraints on the fueling models and may allow us to distinguish between seeding models more effectively (see Section 10).',\n",

       " 'Recent work has revisited the slow-formation scenario described in Section 2.1 in the context of dynamical formation of black hole–black hole binaries observable as gravitational wave mergers (e.g., Rodriguez et al. 2018). Indeed, there is some prospect for useful observational constraints for this channel using gravitational wave observations from the current generation of detectors (Kovetz et al. 2018). The predictions for the slow scenario depend in essential ways on whether the dynamics of close encounters are treated in a relativistic manner. Although there is no simple expression for the gravitational recoil velocity as a function of the black hole masses, mergers with more extreme-mass ratios tend to have lower velocities. The predictions also depend strongly on the unknown initial spins of black holes, which can lead to enormous velocities that will eject nearly all systems from clusters (Campanelli et al. 2007). Even if the initial spins are low, postmerger products will have higher spins, suggesting that successive mergers are more likely to eject black holes. Holley-Bockelmann et al. (2008) found that in most cases the IMBH is ejected over a wide range of seed masses, unless all the encounters have mass ratios \\n\\n. To ensure that this condition is met would require that the initial seed be \\n\\n500 M⊙ and that it is surrounded by a subcluster of \\n\\n25M⊙ stellar-mass black holes.

Some other studies (e.g., Giersz et al. 2015) that advocate for slow IMBH formation in star clusters sometimes miss the crucial contribution of recoil in the dynamics of IMBH formation through this channel. Although the occupation fraction from the slow channel is uncertain, current simulations are consistent with a low or negligible value for typical globular clusters.',\n",
       " 'For the fast channel, Portegies Zwart & McMillan (2002) argue that fast runaway only applies to clusters with short initial relaxation times. A short relaxation time excludes most typical globular clusters, unless perhaps they are born with primordial mass segregation. Gürkan et al. (2004) find that runaway collisions should be common in dense clusters, but the final product of the runaway is uncertain, because a supermassive star formed by collisions will evolve on a timescale comparable with the collision rate (Freitag et al. 2006). The metallicity of the stars and the possible presence of gas in the core add additional complications. Hence, it is difficult to predict whether a supermassive star will form at all, its expected mass if it does form, and whether it would eventually collapse to an IMBH or instead destroy itself entirely as a pair-instability supernova (Spera & Mapelli 2017).',\n",

If so, then most of these clusters will preferentially migrate to galaxy centers. However, there is voluminous evidence that most globular clusters of all metallicities formed in the same way that massive clusters still form today, rather than in a unique channel only operating in the early Universe (e.g., Brodie & Strader 2006, El-Badry et al. 2019).',\n",
       " '\\nMiller & Davies (2012) argue that all clusters above a central velocity dispersion of ∼40 km s−1 necessarily form an IMBH through some mechanism, because neither primordial nor dynamically formed binaries of stars or stellar remnants can prevent core collapse for these velocity dispersions. This analytic argument rests on efficient ejection of stellar-mass black holes. Breen & Heggie (2013) argue that black hole ejection is expected to be rather inefficient for typical globular clusters, and hence core collapse will usually occur only after many relaxation times. This result is generally borne out by numerical simulations (e.g., Kremer et al. 2019), though few simulations of \\n\\n106-M⊙ clusters have yet been published.',\n",
       " 'Overall, there is little theoretical support for the idea that IMBH formation is favored in typical globular clusters.

To date, no such trustworthy sources have been found (although see Section 5 for some candidates). One way out of this constraint is to note that few sensitive optical, radio, or X-ray surveys for massive black holes are currently possible outside of the Milky Way, which itself has scarcely any young massive clusters (see Section 5). Another way out is that the channel may require low metallicities (Mapelli 2016), and then we would not expect it to operate in the local Universe. However, metal-poor and metal-rich clusters have no observed substantial structural or dynamical differences, so if IMBHs form commonly but only in low-metallicity clusters, they have not yet been found to affect the clusters in any noticeable way.',\n",
       " 'To translate these predictions into number densities, we first consider galaxy nuclei, and then the cluster population. If gravitational runaway happens, one would think that nuclear star clusters, the most massive and densest clusters, may be the most likely to form and retain IMBHs. However, not all nuclear star clusters may successfully form massive black holes by gravitational collapse (Breen & Heggie 2013; Section 5). We therefore assume that under this channel, there will be a wide range of occupation fractions in galaxy nuclei, between 10% and 100%. Adopting a measured range of nucleation fractions as a function of stellar mass from Sánchez-Janssen et al. (2019; see also Neumayer et al. 2020) we find a final number density of 0.02–0.25 Mpc−3 (\\nTable 1\\n). This number could be higher than that for early collapse models.

Such clusters should be detectable as resolved stars in future wide-field surveys such as that to be conducted on the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), because current observations are already discovering very low-mass globular clusters in the outer halo (e.g., HSC-1, with ∼250 stars; Homma et al. 2019). Follow-up spectroscopy of even a few stars in such objects could reveal their provenance via an unexpectedly large velocity dispersion. Closer to the Sun, remnant recoil clusters containing only a handful of stars could be identified using Gaia data as a population in a small patch of sky (less than about a few ×10 arcsec) with a net proper motion and a substantial dispersion around that value. These IMBHs could also pass through molecular clouds in the disk, sparking into detectability from the additional fuel as a faint radio source with high proper motion (Fender et al. 2013).',\n",

A related pathway comes from very early accretion of satellites. Mergers between satellites could have led to ejections of black holes that might still be wandering around the Milky Way.

With the number of such clusters calculated in the prior paragraph, we then expect somewhere between zero and two ultracompact dwarfs for the Milky Way (e.g., M54 and perhaps ω Cen), and somewhere between 75 and 150 in a cluster like Virgo, as observed (Liu et al. 2015).

Likewise it is unclear whether Pop III seeds can grow efficiently in low-mass halos at early times (e.g., Pelupessy et al. 2007, Alvarez et al. 2009).

       " 'Dynamical modeling of supermassive black holes has a long history and has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995, Kormendy & Ho 2013). The kinematics can be measured from either stars or gas in the vicinity of the black hole. For stellar-dynamical modeling, state-of-the-art codes use Schwarzschild modeling (Schwarzschild 1979) to jointly model the mass density of the central black hole, stars, and dark matter by orbit superposition (e.g., Rix et al. 1997, Gebhardt et al. 2003). The stellar-mass profile is modeled from the light, which is then converted to a mass profile by solving for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and if needed a dark matter halo component is also independently fitted (e.g., Gebhardt & Thomas 2009). The orbit families are weighted to match the spatially resolved stellar kinematical measurements. A major issue for all dynamical models is distinguishing between orbital anisotropy and mass (e.g., a black hole). This mass–anisotropy degeneracy is well known (e.g., Binney & Mamon 1982). Other (related) issues include: (a) degeneracy between the stellar M/L and the black hole mass, (b) incomplete stellar orbit libraries, and (c) the assumption of axisymmetry (van den Bosch & de Zeeuw 2010). The systematic uncertainties for black hole masses from gas dynamics are qualitatively different than they are for stellar dynamics, but given the large systematics for both kinds of analysis, we use them interchangeably in our discussion (although see a more complete discussion in Walsh et al. 2013).',\n",

To detect a black hole, the region within which the gravity of the black hole dominates the stellar motions must be resolved. This gravitational sphere of influence, roughly where the mass enclosed in stars equals that of the black hole, is given by: SOI (pc) ≈ 0.0043 (M\\nBH/M⊙) (σ/kms−1)−2.

Another challenge is M/L determinations, which are more complicated in low-mass galaxies due to ongoing star formation and dust. A third is nonaxisymmetric structures such as disks and bars, and other irregular star-forming features (e.g., Kormendy & Kennicutt 2004). A fourth is that individual bright stars can dominate the total light output, biasing the measured stellar dispersion (e.g., Lützgendorf et al. 2015). In galaxies with ongoing star formation, this issue is particularly important. In the Milky Way, Feldmeier et al.

For instance, center determinations for the LMC have an uncertainty that is greater than a square degree (van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014). For more distant galaxies, the astronomical community has avoided issues of determining galactic centers by focusing on galaxies with known nuclear star clusters, which encompasses nearly all galaxies with M\\n\\\\* ∼ 109–1010 M⊙ (Georgiev & Böker 2014, Sánchez-Janssen et al. 2019). At lower galaxy masses, as the nucleation fraction drops and galaxies appear more irregular, we will be fundamentally limited by centroid determinations.',\n",
       " 'Finally, one of the most challenging limitations to dynamical masses for <104-M⊙ black holes in dense stellar systems is confusion between a putative IMBH and a central cluster of stellar-mass remnants. As dense stellar clusters evolve, the compact remnants sink to the center of the cluster and segregate in mass. Thus, the detailed assumptions made about the presence of stellar remnants (especially stellar-mass black holes) have a crucial impact on the relative evidence for an IMBH (e.g., Mann et al. 2019, and references therein). A related issue is that because of mass segregation and the desire to constrain IMBHs of modest mass, there may be very few luminous stars within the sphere of influence to provide dynamical constraints (see Section 3.2). Studies that do not carefully consider a range of predictions for stellar remnants will not reach robust conclusions about IMBHs. Observations in galaxy nuclei are already approaching this limit for the nearest sources (Nguyen et al. 2019b).',\n",
       " 'When possible, stellar dynamics can be more precisely measured through proper motions of individual stars, which can break the mass–anisotropy degeneracy (e.g., Zocchi et al. 2017). Nevertheless, there are still challenges with these measurements, which generally are used to look for less massive black holes as well.',\n",
       " 'As a test case, consider the well-studied globular cluster 47 Tuc. The sphere of influence of an ∼1,000-M⊙ black hole in 47 Tuc would only be ∼1 arcsec, and few stars will be observable within this radius. For example, studies of the central 1 arcsec with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) have only produced precise proper motions for 11–12 stars (McLaughlin et al. 2006, Mann et al. 2019) down to a main-sequence mass of ∼0.65M⊙. Because the central mass function is relatively depleted of low-mass stars due to mass segregation, the total number of stars observable in the sphere of influence of such an IMBH, even down to the hydrogen-burning limit with next-generation extremely large telescopes, might still only be \\n\\n50 stars. With this modest sample, it is not clear that the advantages in breaking the mass–anisotropy degeneracy gained from proper motions will be definitive in proving the presence of ∼1,000-M⊙ IMBHs. By contrast, an ∼3,000–4,000-M⊙ IMBH would have a factor of ∼10–15 more stars within the sphere of influence and hence be considerably easier to detect than a 1,000-M⊙ IMBH.',\n",
       " 'The concerns about a misleading population of dense stellar remnants still apply to proper motion measurements. The current state of the art is to use N-body codes to model the possible signal from such a cluster of stellar-mass compact remnants (e.g., Baumgardt 2017), which still leaves ambiguous cases. A possible way to alleviate this degeneracy is to determine indirect tests of the presence of stellar-mass compact objects such as expected numbers of pulsars or X-ray binaries. Perhaps more promising is the finding by MacLeod et al. (2016a) that IMBHs should typically acquire companions with orbital periods of years, corresponding to semimajor axes of ∼5–10 mas for typical globular cluster distances and ∼1,000-M⊙ IMBHs. In the models, the companions undergo frequent exchanges, but about half of the time these companions would be main-sequence stars or giants, most of which should be observable in data of sufficient depth with extremely large telescopes. The proper motion due to the orbit should be very high compared to other cluster members (more than about a few milliarcseconds per year), making such stars readily identifiable even in short-baseline observations, and distinguishable from foreground stars by their precise central location. The theoretical predictions by MacLeod et al. (2016a) cover a small range of parameter space, and it would be worthwhile to see extensions to a wider set of IMBH masses and core densities. This method could not prove the absence of an IMBH in any particular cluster, because a visible companion cannot be guaranteed. However, if a few hundred-M⊙ black holes are common in clusters, companion studies could push down to lower masses than any other method. The timing of millisecond pulsars in even wider orbits could also reveal the presence of an IMBH, though the interpretation of these timing observations is not necessarily straightforward. We revisit some of these issues in Section 3.5.',\n",

Because the LMC is so close to the Milky Way, we have high spatial resolution and thus sensitivity to even lower-mass black holes. However, the increased resolution is debilitating. No measurement of the center of the LMC is in good agreement with any other (van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014); thus it is very challenging to know where to search for a putative massive black hole.

In the case of Sagittarius, the nucleus is the globular cluster also known as M54. Because the galaxy is actively being disrupted, indirect means are needed to estimate the original mass of the galaxy. Summing of the light in the tidal features (Niederste-Ostholt et al. 2010) and modeling of the stream (Laporte et al. 2018) and stellar abundances and abundance ratios (de Boer et al. 2014) all suggest that the galaxy was one of the more massive satellites, comparable with the Small Magellanic Cloud, with a stellar mass of a few ×108 M⊙.

The major caveat here, also noted by the authors, is that the initial location of the black hole in the galaxy is unconstrained (e.g., Bellovary et al. 2019). To find any 103–104-M⊙ black holes that may be lurking in Local Group dwarfs will likely require proper motions with an extremely large telescope (e.g., Greene et al. 2019).',\n",

In terms of mass and size, we do not see obvious biases in the nuclear star cluster properties in this sample relative to Georgiev & Böker (2014), nor is there evidence for differences between red and blue galaxies (see also Foord et al. 2017).

The Milky Way may host a population of leftover IMBHs from past accretion of dwarf galaxies (e.g., Rashkov & Madau 2014, and Section 2.1).

Rather strict constraints exist from the small residual proper motion of Sgr A\\\\* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy: No dark object larger than 104 M⊙ is permitted within 103–105 AU from Sgr A\\\\* (Reid & Brunthaler 2004).',\n",

The inward migration of an IMBH can also account for the origin of the kinematic distribution of these young stars (Yu et al. 2007). To this end, the bright IR source IRS 13E, at a projected distance of only 0.13 pc from Sgr A\\\\*, has been the subject of intense scrutiny. High spatial resolution observations by Maillard et al. (2004) resolve the source into a compact group of several comoving massive stars, prompting speculation that it constitutes the disrupted core of a young massive cluster in which an IMBH has coalesced by runaway growth (e.g., Portegies Zwart & McMillan 2002). The proper motion measurements by Schödel et al. (2005) would require a large black hole mass of >104 M⊙, which is difficult to reconcile with the absence of clear nonthermal radio and X-ray emission.

The spectrum of its associated millimeter continuum and IR source, however, is more consistent with that of a protostellar disk instead of a scaled-down version of Sgr A\\\\* (Ravi et al. 2018), and its detailed kinematics are more consistent with cloud–cloud collisions (Tanaka 2018) or supernova-driven interactions (Yalinewich & Beniamini 2018).

However, the velocity dispersion signature of an IMBH is not found in the proper motions of central stars (van der Marel & Anderson 2010), and no resolution of this observational issue has been given in the literature. On the modeling side, anisotropy and the presence of dark remnants could account for most or all of the IMBH signature found in other studies (e.g., Zocchi et al. 2017, 2019; Baumgardt et al. 2019). Some papers have highlighted the need for more sophisticated modeling of the velocities and proper motions of individual stars (see Section 3.2) rather than a binned dispersion profile in the context of ω Cen and other clusters (Lützgendorf et al. 2012, Baumgardt et al. 2019, Mann et al. 2019).

Multiple studies working with similar data sets have found tentative evidence for an ∼104-M⊙ IMBH in M54, with the same interpretation caveats as that for ω Cen, and the additional complication that the cluster is embedded in the remnants of the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy (Ibata et al. 2009, Baumgardt 2017). There is no accretion evidence for an IMBH in any of these clusters (Tremou et al. 2018; Section 5).

G1 was notable not solely for the contested interpretation of the central kinematics (Gebhardt et al. 2002, 2005; Baumgardt et al. 2003), which have the same issues already discussed, but also for the unique addition of X-ray and radio accretion evidence for a possible IMBH (Pooley & Rappaport 2006, Ulvestad et al. 2007, and Section 4). Unfortunately, this radio emission was not confirmed in deeper observations, and the multiwavelength data are consistent with a standard low-mass X-ray binary (Miller-Jones et al. 2012).

Subsequent analyses of similar pulsar data sets did not reproduce this result: They found no evidence for an IMBH, with a formal 99% upper limit of <4,000 M⊙ (Freire et al. 2017, Abbate et al. 2018). This nondetection is consistent with the results of several studies that modeled the detailed proper motions of individual stars in the core of 47 Tuc (McLaughlin et al. 2006, Mann et al. 2019), or a combination of stars and pulsars (Hénault-Brunet et al. 2020), and found 1σ upper limits in the range of \\n\\n1,000–1,500 M⊙.

Typically, the microlensing effects discussed are photometric, resulting in magnification of the background source by the lens. However, the optical depth for photometric microlensing by IMBHs is very low (Safonova & Stalin 2010), and detections are unlikely for reasonable monitoring campaigns of Galactic globular clusters. Kains et al. (2016) instead suggest the possibility of using astrometric microlensing, which is much less sensitive to the angular separation of the source and lens than standard microlensing. The detectability of this astrometric microlensing signal is maximized for clusters close to the Sun that also have high background densities. This methodology was used to search for evidence of a central IMBH in M22 with HST by Kains et al. (2018).

In light of the apparent rarity of AGNs in late-type hosts (Ho et al. 1997, Ho 2008), large spectroscopic surveys are needed to tease out any significant statistical sample. Greene & Ho (2004) performed the first systematic search for AGNs powered by low-mass black holes using SDSS DR1 (Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 1), producing 19 low-redshift (z < 0.35) broad-line AGNs with estimated black hole masses \\n\\n106 M⊙, which was subsequently boosted to a sample of ∼200 using SDSS DR4 (Greene & Ho 2007b,c).

This mass is consistent, within the considerable tolerance of the uncertainties, with the direct dynamical estimate of \\n\\n M⊙ by den Brok et al. (2015). Woo et al. (2019) recently advocated a markedly lower value of M\\nBH ≈ 9,100 M⊙, based on a short, 80-min lag detected from a narrow-band Hα reverberation-mapping campaign with rapid sampling. The published mass adopts a virial constant f\\nvir = 4.5. Using a value calibrated to lower-mass spiral galaxies (f\\nvir = 3.2; Ho & Kim 2014), the mass formally drops to M\\nBH ≈ 6,500 M⊙. The difference in black hole mass between Woo et al. and Peterson et al. is mainly due to differences between the line width of Civ and Hα, though the two works recover consistent lags. Very few studies have done intercomparisons of multiple lines in the context of reverberation mapping, and certainly not in this mass and luminosity range (e.g., Park et al. 2017).',\n",

The published lag for SDSS J114008.71+030711.4 (i.e., the object named GH08 in Greene & Ho 2004) of \\n\\n days is short and highly uncertain (Rafter et al. 2011), but it is likely less than 6 days, in which case M\\nBH < 3.9 × 105 M⊙. Finally, we mention three Seyfert 1 nuclei with well-measured Hβ lags hosted in late-type spiral galaxies, as summarized by Ho & Kim (2014): NGC 4051 with τ = 2.5 ± 0.1 days and log (M\\nBH/M⊙) = 6.11 ± 0.04, NGC 4253 (Mrk 766) with \\n\\n days and log (M\\nBH/M⊙) = 5.98 ± 0.29, and Mrk 202 with τ = 3.5 ± 0.1 days and log (M\\nBH/M⊙) = 5.98 ± 0.06.',\n",
       " 'Reverberation mapping also provides a relationship (the so-called radius–luminosity relation) between the AGN luminosity and the typical size of the broad-line region (e.g., Bentz et al. 2013). Using the virial constant and the radius–luminosity relation, we can calculate single-epoch virial black hole masses for broad-line AGNs. It is hard to know what the systematic uncertainties are on these masses, particularly at low black hole mass where the radius–luminosity relation is not directly measured.',\n",
       " 'Searching for concrete evidence of AGNs in low-mass galaxies poses a set of unique challenges. One of the major complications in applying the traditional optical BPT diagrams is that the AGNs become hopelessly intermingled with star-forming galaxies at low metallicity (Groves et al. 2006, Stasińska et al. 2006, Cann et al. 2019). Along with a BPT selection, Sartori et al. (2015) selected additional samples using both an Heii λ4686 diagnostic diagram and mid-IR color cuts that have proved effective in selecting luminous AGNs (Jarrett et al. 2011, Stern et al. 2012). Distressingly, almost none of the samples identified by the three methods overlap. Why?',\n",
       " 'As Hainline et al. (2016) emphasize, young starbursts in the low-metallicity environment of dwarf galaxies have red mid-IR colors that closely mimic those of AGNs. This, unfortunately, calls into question the usage of mid-IR color to select AGNs in late-type, low-mass galaxies (Satyapal et al. 2014, Marleau et al. 2017, Kaviraj et al. 2019). The lower metallicity environment of dwarf galaxies is characterized by higher electron temperatures and higher levels of excitation for the ISM. In theory, there may also be a more top-heavy stellar initial mass function (e.g., Bromm et al. 2002). The preponderance of massive stars profoundly affects the heating and ionization of the gas. High-mass X-ray binaries may be responsible for the ionizing photons for Heii λ4686 (Schaerer et al. 2019). If so, Heii ceases to be a useful AGN indicator in dwarf galaxies (Sartori et al. 2015, Bär et al. 2017). Massive O stars and Wolf-Rayet stars can generate sufficient extreme UV radiation to excite high-ionization lines such as [Oiv] 25.89 μm (Lutz et al. 1998, Schaerer & Stasińska 1999), which renders moot any attempt to use this line to select low-mass AGNs (Georgakakis et al. 2011). [Nev] 14.32 μm, normally considered a robust AGN indicator because of its high-ionization potential of 97.12 eV (Satyapal et al. 2007, 2008, 2009; Goulding et al. 2010), is not immune either, as it can be excited by fast-shocks produced by stellar winds from massive stars and supernovae (Contini 1997, Izotov et al. 2012).',\n",
       " 'As a case in point, we draw attention to the local spheroidal NGC 185, whose nuclear optical line emission, though feeble, technically qualifies it as a Seyfert 2 galaxy (Ho et al. 1997). However, the recent detailed spatially resolved optical and X-ray analyses of this object by Vučetić et al. (2019) clearly show that the excitation of the central nebula is due to supernova remnants. NGC 185 is a fake AGN. This caveat may well impact larger samples of AGNs selected based on narrow emission lines.',\n",
       " 'Even broad emission lines are not sacrosanct. Although the presence of broad Hα lines is typically regarded as ironclad evidence of an AGN, high-velocity gas can also be of stellar origin. Wolf-Rayet galaxies, for example, often exhibit broad wings to the Hα line (Méndez & Esteban 1997), and the optical spectra of some type II supernovae bear an uncanny resemblance to Seyfert 1 nuclei (Filippenko 1989). Baldassare et al. (2016) obtained multiple-epoch observations of the type 1 sources from Reines et al. (2013) with evidence of star formation in their narrow-line spectra and discovered that in most of them the broad Hα line is transient over a baseline of several years, suggesting a supernova origin. Even when broad Hα is persistent and too strong to be explained easily by supernovae, as is the case in some blue compact dwarfs (Izotov & Thuan 2008, Izotov et al. 2010), no compelling, independent evidence for AGNs has yet surfaced. Follow-up Chandra observations of the metal-poor AGN candidates of Izotov & Thuan (2008) reveal that their X-ray emission is far weaker compared to their optical or mid-IR emission than expected for active galaxies (Simmonds et al. 2016). Even sensitive X-ray and radio observations do not find compelling evidence for AGNs in blue compact dwarfs (Latimer et al. 2019). There is also the converse problem, that broadened lines with ∼200–400 km s−1 may arise from the narrow-line region of an obscured AGN, with the width reflecting nonvirial motions associated with the AGN. In such cases, the line width may not have any relation to the black hole mass. Studies that push to ambitiously low line width may suffer this contamination (Chilingarian et al. 2018).',\n",
       " 'Several of the AGN candidates in late-type galaxies originally identified through detection of [Oiv] 25.89 μm or [Nev] 14.32 μm have since been followed up in X-rays (Gliozzi et al. 2009, Georgakakis et al. 2011, McAlpine et al. 2011, Secrest et al. 2012, Hebbar et al. 2019), and in general the X-rays are found to be weaker than expected. Diffuse, thermal emission is occasionally detected when the data are of sufficient quality. Certainly one can appeal to absorption to explain the deficit of hard X-rays, but we cannot rule out the possibility that these galaxies actually lack AGNs.',\n",
       " 'Given the observation of central black holes in the Local Group with very low Eddington ratios (including Sgr A⋆ and M31⋆), the minority population of highly accreting black holes identified by optical spectroscopy must be the tip of the iceberg. In addition to being faint, AGNs of low accretion rate have systematically lower ionization parameters (Ho 2009), and they may lack broad emission lines altogether (Elitzur & Ho 2009). X-ray observations provide a clean tool to overcome these problems in a wide range of circumstances. Black hole accretion invariably generates X-ray emission (Brandt & Alexander 2015), and low accretion rates have the virtue of producing proportionately even more hard X-rays (Ho 2008). The resolving power of Chandra and the low background of its ACIS (Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility CCD Imaging Spectrometer) instrument offer the ideal combination for detecting faint compact sources in nearby galaxies, even with short exposures, and the excellent astrometric accuracy of the satellite can align the optical or near-IR nucleus of the galaxy to within 1 arcsec or better. The main source of confusion comes from X-ray binaries, but the degree of contamination can be estimated once the stellar mass and star-formation rate are known (e.g., Miller et al. 2015).',\n",
       " 'A number of studies have exploited this opportunity to evaluate the incidence of AGNs in nearby late-type galaxies, succeeding in identifying X-ray nuclei in star-forming (Ghosh et al. 2008, Zhang et al. 2009, Grier et al. 2011, She et al. 2017a), dwarf irregular (Lemons et al. 2015), and local Lyman-break analog (Jiang et al. 2011) galaxies. Desroches & Ho (2009) analyzed Chandra images of 64 Scd-Sm spirals within 30 Mpc and discovered an X-ray core in 17 of them (\\n\\n). The Sc-Sm spirals in the sample of Zhang et al. (2009) yield a consistent result (\\n\\n). She et al. (2017b) extended this effort to a more comprehensive census of more than 700 galaxies within 50 Mpc; among late-type, bulgeless spirals, the detection rate of X-ray cores is \\n\\n. Unlike the optically selected sources, these X-ray-selected nuclei are all highly sub-Eddington, with median L/L\\nbol ≈ 10−4. Archival work searching for X-rays in ultracompact dwarfs has been far less conclusive (Pandya et al. 2016).',\n",
       " 'The above efforts, largely based on archival data, have been complemented by a series of experiments aimed at characterizing the incidence of X-ray nuclei using dedicated Chandra surveys of nearby, lower-mass early-type galaxies focused on the Virgo cluster (Ghosh et al. 2008, Gallo et al. 2010), on the Fornax cluster (Lee et al. 2019), and in the field (Miller et al. 2012, Gallo & Sesana 2019). Among the ∼200 early-type galaxies within 30 Mpc uniformly observed to date, Miller et al. (2015) conclude that \\n\\n in galaxies with stellar mass M\\n\\\\* < 1010 M⊙. Their observations in this stellar-mass range are sensitive to L/L\\nbol ≈ 10−4, but in more massive galaxies, the same depths probe much lower L/L\\nbol. By assuming that the Eddington ratio distribution can be modeled as a smooth function of M\\n\\\\*, Miller et al. bracket the occupation fraction to fall between 30% and 100% at 1σ (see also Gallo & Sesana 2019). Work by Aird et al. (2013) supports the idea that the Eddington ratio distribution varies only very mildly as a function of stellar mass. Finally, it is very encouraging that the active fractions uncovered from X-rays in both star-forming and quiescent low-mass galaxies are comparable. These X-ray results, combined with the dynamical ones above (Section 3), strongly suggest a high (>50%) occupation fraction in M\\n\\\\* = 109–1010 M⊙ galaxies.',\n",
       " 'Recently Reines et al. (2019) used deep and high-resolution radio imaging with the Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to follow up on 111 dwarf galaxies (3 × 107 < M\\n\\\\*/M⊙ < 3 × 109) with prior radio detections in FIRST data. Of these, 13 are likely to be powered by AGNs, owing to their point-like natures and luminosities relative to their star-formation rates. Only 1 of these 13 was also identified by optical spectroscopy. These data cannot be used to measure the AGN fraction in a straightforward way because of the sample selection, but they do highlight the promise of even existing radio telescopes to unveil lower-luminosity AGN populations. Intriguingly, many of the sources are found offset from their galaxy nucleus, which is perhaps consistent with predictions (Bellovary et al. 2019, Pfister et al. 2019) that in low-mass galaxies the seed black holes may never settle at galaxy centers (Section 2.1). Another possible origin for some of these sources may be fueling of wandering black holes (see also Section 5).',\n",
       " 'Combining radio emission with X-rays could be even more effective at probing AGNs with very low Eddington ratios. Merloni et al. (2003) and Falcke et al. (2004) found that both supermassive and stellar-mass black holes show fundamental similarities in their accretion flows in the radiatively inefficient low/hard state. Observationally, the X-ray luminosity (L\\nX; a product of the accretion rate and radiative efficiency) and the radio continuum luminosity (L\\nR; a measure of the jet power) scale with the mass of the black hole in a simple manner, such that a combination of these three quantities forms a tolerably clean two-dimensional sequence (the fundamental plane) in three-dimensional space.',\n",
       " 'A physical explanation for this fundamental plane is not necessarily straightforward, because the spectral energy distributions of accretion flows are expected to change systematically with black hole mass. There are no clear conclusions about whether most or all of the radio and X-ray emission is associated with a jet or whether the X-ray emission might instead come from a corona that is separate from the jet while still presumably being linked to the accretion flow (see, e.g., the discussion in Plotkin et al. 2012).',\n",
       " 'A major challenge in using the fundamental plane comes from the large scatter. This considerable scatter must be at least partially intrinsic, based on a number of arguments. One is that among X-ray binaries, L\\nR/L\\nX can vary by a factor of at least a few at fixed L\\nX (e.g., Jonker et al. 2012). Another is that even in the newest modeling of the fundamental plane—with careful restriction to objects with high-quality dynamical masses and radio and X-ray data, and consideration of the measurement uncertainties—the scatter for determining black hole masses is still large at ∼1 dex. The best-fit plane from Gültekin et al. (2019) is log (M/108M⊙) = (1.09 ± 0.10) log (L\\nR/1038 erg s−1) (−0.59 ± 0.16) log (L\\nX/1040 erg s−1) + (0.55 ± 0.22). We note that the use of previous fits based on careful sample selection and fitting (e.g., Plotkin et al. 2012) would give similar results within the uncertainties in most cases. Despite these uncertainties, many works have moved forward in an observational spirit to use the fundamental plane to constrain black hole masses in circumstances in which more direct measurements are prohibitively difficult or impossible.',\n",
       " 'Soon after the discovery of the fundamental plane, Maccarone (2004) pointed out that this would be a powerful tool to search for IMBHs in globular clusters (Section 5). The first high-profile use of the fundamental plane to show evidence for a modest-mass nuclear black hole was in the starburst galaxy Henize 2-10 (Reines et al. 2011). Reines et al. used the radio and X-ray data to argue for the presence of a log M/M⊙ = 6.3 ± 1.1 supermassive black hole. Follow-up very long-baseline interferometry observations constrained the radio source size to be <3 × 1 pc and confirmed a nonthermal origin (Reines & Deller 2012). Higher-resolution data revealed multiple components to the central X-ray source, moving the fundamental plane mass estimate up to log M/M⊙ ∼ 7 (Reines et al. 2016). Subsequent work showed that the X-ray spectrum of the nuclear source is more consistent with a supernova remnant than an AGN (Hebbar et al. 2019), although the possible presence of hour-scale variability would not favor this scenario (Reines et al. 2016, Hebbar et al. 2019). There is also no evidence for AGN ionization in the galaxy center (Cresci et al. 2017). In the end, given the stellar mass of 1010 M⊙ (Nguyen et al. 2014), the detection of a black hole may be of limited relevance for IMBH studies, but it does show that use of the fundamental plane is challenging in star-forming galaxies.',\n",
       " 'Another use of the fundamental plane to find evidence for a low-mass central black hole is in the low-mass galaxy NGC 404, where the plane yielded a mass estimate of log M/M⊙ = 6.4 ± 1.1 (Nyland et al. 2012). Newer observations may support an AGN interpretation of this system, although the evidence is not yet conclusive (Nyland et al. 2017). In contrast, dynamical studies of NGC 404 give a 3σ upper limit of M\\nBH < 1.5 × 105M⊙ (Nguyen et al. 2017). These measurements are formally consistent given the large scatter in the fundamental plane but cannot be taken as a vote of confidence for the success of the fundamental plane near the IMBH regime.',\n",
       " 'Going forward, for most reasonable central black hole mass functions, volume-limited fundamental plane surveys are almost certainly needed to effectively address the question of whether IMBHs exist, due to the usual Malmquist bias that a flux-limited survey is much more likely to detect massive black holes at larger distances. If IMBHs are less common than central black holes of higher masses (see Section 9), then this bias would be exacerbated by the scatter in the fundamental plane, producing an Eddington-like bias in the IMBH candidate sample.',\n",
       " 'Consider the use of the fundamental plane to find candidate IMBHs well suited for dynamical follow-up in a nearly fixed distance sample, e.g., the Chandra survey of Virgo galaxies by Gallo et al. (2008). This survey found a large number of central X-ray sources with luminosities near their detection limit of ∼4 × 1038 erg s−1. If a subset of these sources hosted IMBHs with masses in the range of 104–105M⊙ and they obeyed the fundamental plane, the 5-GHz radio continuum flux densities would typically be only a few microjanskys. Such sensitivities are achievable with very long (10–20 h) integrations on the Jansky VLA, but the time investment for such a fishing expedition would be challenging for more than a few galaxies. However, next-generation facilities such as the Next Generation VLA (ngVLA), which has a factor of 10 higher sensitivity than the Jansky VLA, could carry out a survey of ∼100 galaxies with a reasonable time investment and, with a resolution of <0.1 arcsec, could pinpoint the location of any radio emission. Cross-matching with existing high-resolution HST images could weed out possible nonnuclear contaminants such as star-forming regions, supernova remnants, or background galaxies.',\n",
       " 'All AGNs vary, and this has been used as a successful selection tool (e.g., Sarajedini et al. 2006, MacLeod et al. 2011). In the near future, a number of upcoming surveys will make variability selection very powerful for IMBH searches.',\n",
       " 'Optical variability has been used to select low-mass black holes specifically (Morokuma et al. 2016), but the promise of this technique has not been fully explored yet. Heinis et al.

(2018, 2019) use optical variability to find AGN candidates in galaxies with M\\n\\\\* spanning 107–1010 M⊙, a large fraction of which are not uncovered through optical emission-line selection. With upcoming surveys like LSST, this discovery space should grow.',\n",
       " 'AGNs also vary at radio wavelengths, for diverse reasons both intrinsic (variations in the accretion rate, shocks in the relativistic jet) and extrinsic (scattering and/or magnification caused by interstellar plasma). Synoptic radio surveys have successfully used radio variability to select AGNs (e.g., Mooley et al. 2016). Current and future radio continuum surveys such as the VLA Sky Survey and those with the Square Kilometer Array could identify candidate IMBHs as variable radio sources associated with low-mass galaxies.',\n",
       " 'IMBHs should also leave distinct signatures in their X-ray variability signals. Specifically, because the X-ray emission region is very compact compared to more massive black holes with AGNs, the variability timescales should be short. This is clearly seen with NGC 4395 (Moran et al. 2005). Kamizasa et al. (2012) leveraged this idea to search the XMM-Newton archive for low-mass black hole candidates. Those they found have a median black hole mass of ∼106 M⊙ (Ho & Kim 2016), but in principle surveys like eROSITA may further such a search. The X-ray excess variance, while promising as a search tool, may not track black hole mass anymore below \\n\\n106 M⊙, where the variance–mass relation seems to flatten (Ludlam et al. 2015, Pan et al. 2015).',\n",
       " 'In addition to pushing to deeper limits for local samples, we could gain orthogonal demographic constraints by looking at high-luminosity sources over much larger volumes; this work is in its infancy. So far, the effort to search for accreting black holes in dwarf galaxies beyond the local Universe has focused on deep X-ray observations of well-studied extragalactic fields, finding candidates from z < 0.5 (Schramm et al. 2013, Pardo et al. 2016, Aird et al. 2018) out to z ≈ 2.4 (Mezcua et al. 2016, 2018a). We emphasize that these objects should be considered as candidates. In the case of the Mezcua objects in particular, many of the faint sources are proximate to more luminous objects, making the matching particularly challenging. The use of photometric redshifts with active galaxies also adds additional ambiguity. Finally, in these very high-redshift sources, the implied Eddington ratios are substantially super-Eddington. Additional follow-up is needed. As high-redshift spectroscopic samples continue to grow (e.g., Takada et al. 2014), we will continue to build reliable luminosity functions for lower-mass black holes at intermediate and high redshifts.',\n",

In the future, along with next-generation X-ray missions, deep spectroscopic surveys with JWST and WFIRST will provide complementary samples of optically selected AGNs at moderate redshift.',\n",

       " 'Usually ULX samples are constructed from objects for which the Eddington limit is exceeded for a typical stellar-mass black hole of ∼10M⊙ (although the mass of the compact object may vary). ULXs were initially interpreted as strong candidates for IMBHs, largely from the simple argument that inferred isotropic luminosities \\n\\n1040 erg s−1 imply accretors above ∼100M⊙ (e.g., Colbert & Mushotzky 1999). By definition, ULXs are nonnuclear, to rule out quiescent or low/hard emission from central supermassive black holes.',\n",
       " 'Early surveys for ULXs were primarily statistical, because contamination from background AGNs can dominate candidate ULX samples (Zolotukhin et al. 2016). ULXs are overabundant in star-forming galaxies and indeed are primarily found near regions of recent star formation themselves (Swartz et al. 2009), which is consistent with ULXs being associated with young massive stars rather than old globular clusters or Pop III remnants. ULXs are also much more common among metal-poor stellar populations than those of solar metallicity (per unit of star formation; Prestwich et al. 2013).',\n",
       " 'X-ray spectra of ULXs show substantial variety, but overall are not congruent with the states observed for Galactic stellar-mass black holes scaled to the IMBH mass regime. Instead, some ULXs show distinct spectral states that can be physically interpreted as ultraluminous states consistent with super-Eddington accretion onto stellar-mass black holes (see discussion in Kaaret et al. 2017).',\n",
       " 'Another breakthrough in the interpretation of ULXs was the observation of X-ray pulsations in some ULXs (Bachetti et al. 2014, Fürst et al. 2016, Israel et al. 2017), proving that the accretors in these systems are neutron stars, likely with highly anisotropic accretion due to strong magnetic fields. Some ULXs mooted as IMBHs (e.g., M51 X-7; Earnshaw et al. 2016) have proved to be neutron star ULXs (Rodríguez Castillo et al. 2019).',\n",

The clearest example is HLX-1 (a so-called hyperluminous X-ray source), located in the disk galaxy ESO 243-49 (D ∼ 95 Mpc) at a projected distance ∼4 kpc from the galaxy's center (Farrell et al. 2009).\",\n",

Radio emission associated with the state changes gives similar mass estimates, in the range of M\\nBH ∼ 104–105M⊙ (Webb et al. 2012). The fundamental plane of X-ray/radio emission allows a mass as high as ∼3 × 106M⊙ (Cseh et al. 2015) and hence is of limited utility.',\n",
       " 'An intriguing puzzle in HLX-1 is the nature of the X-ray luminosity variations and state changes. Because X-ray monitoring of the source began in 2008, the state changes appeared nearly periodic at intervals of ∼1 year, leading to the idea that they were associated with the orbital period of a tidally captured companion star on an eccentric orbit (Lasota et al. 2011). Challenging this simple scenario, only a few years later the state change interval began elongating unpredictably; this was perhaps consistent with the unstable, tidally affected orbit of a compact donor such as a white dwarf (Godet et al. 2014). Other models, in which the luminosity variations do not directly reflect the orbital period of a donor star, have also been proposed (e.g., Soria et al. 2017). Future state changes, or a lack thereof, can provide additional constraints on these models.',\n",
       " 'Observations of the surrounding stellar population give additional insight into HLX-1. Although the modeling of the data is not conclusive owing to optical emission associated with HLX-1 itself, the photometry is most consistent with a relatively massive (about a few ×106 M⊙) star cluster dominated by an intermediate to old stellar population (Soria et al. 2017). No compelling evidence for a recent major merger has been observed around the galaxy (Webb et al. 2017), but nevertheless a self-consistent scenario is that HLX-1 represents a central massive black hole on the low-mass end of the mass distribution of nucleated ∼109–1010\\nM\\n\\\\* galaxies whose parent galaxy was accreted and tidally stripped, leaving only the bare nuclear star cluster (e.g., Mapelli et al. 2013). Star formation, perhaps due to the merger, could have increased the capture rate for a central black hole to acquire a companion star on which it is currently feeding. In this scenario, HLX-1 does not represent a unique formation channel for IMBHs, but it is one of the best candidates we have for a (previously central) ∼104-M⊙ black hole.

Brightman et al. (2016) model X-ray data of the source over a wide range of energies and prefer a model of super-Eddington accretion onto a stellar-mass black hole, although depending on the spin, the black hole mass might be as high as ∼100M⊙. The interpretation of these data is not settled, and may require future X-ray missions; confusion with the bright ULX pulsar M82 X-2 is a challenge for low-resolution observations. M82 is a starburst dwarf only ∼3.5 Mpc distant, and a confirmation of a luminous IMBH at such a distance would suggest a high space density of IMBHs.',\n",
       " 'Another source of recent interest is an off-nuclear ULX in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 5252 at ∼100 Mpc (Kim et al. 2015). This ULX has an associated optical and radio source that has been studied at high resolution with the HST and very long baseline interferometry. Overall, these data are consistent with a massive black hole in the ∼105–106-M⊙ regime whose stars have been stripped, though a somewhat lower mass in the IMBH range cannot be excluded (Mezcua et al. 2018b).',\n",
       " \"An even less settled case is that of NGC 2276-3c, an L\\nX = 2 × 1040 erg s−1 ULX in a face-on starburst spiral at ∼33 Mpc. The source was associated with a large (hundreds of parsecs) radio nebula in VLA radio imaging (Mezcua et al. 2013). Follow-up quasi-simultaneous X-ray and very long baseline radio data were used to find unresolved hard X-ray emission and detect a compact parsec-scale radio jet at modest significance (Mezcua et al. 2015). A compact, steady jet is consistent with an AGN in the low/hard state, and the fundamental plane was then used to estimate a mass of ∼5× 104 M⊙ (all such mass estimates have uncertainties of at least 1 dex). However, Yang et al. (2017) independently reduced the radio data and did not confirm the high-resolution radio detection. Furthermore, there is no claimed optical counterpart to the ULX, which might be expected in a scenario in which the IMBH is associated with a star cluster or stripped nucleus. The large number of ULXs found in NGC 2276 (Wolter et al. 2015) suggests that NGC 2276-3c is truly associated with the galaxy. Nonetheless, given the galaxy's high star-formation rate, the lack of an optical counterpart, and uncertain compact jet detection, it seems more likely that NGC 2276-3c is a super-Eddington stellar-mass black hole or a neutron star ULX rather than an IMBH. In this scenario, the extended radio emission might well be associated with NGC 2276-3c, as radio nebulae due to ULXs are not uncommon (see the discussion in Urquhart et al. 2018).\",\n",
       " 'Accretion constraints on the presence of IMBHs in globular clusters rest on the assumption that, in a manner analogous to that of low-luminosity AGNs, such IMBHs will accrete a fraction of the gas within their sphere of influence, resulting in detectable radio or X-ray emission from the accretion flow or jet (Maccarone 2004). To convert a measurement or upper limit in radio or X-ray luminosity to a corresponding IMBH mass or limit requires assumptions about the accretion rate and radiative efficiency of the accretion process.',\n",
       " 'In a globular cluster, the winds of evolved stars represent a source of low-velocity gas that is continually replenished: No long-term accumulation of gas is needed to produce an observable level of accretion. Assuming that the gas is ionized, the expected electron density is n\\n\\ne\\n ∼ 0.05–0.5 cm−3(Pfahl & Rappaport 2001). The predicted level of ionized gas was first observed in the core of the globular cluster 47 Tuc by Freire et al. (2001), using the radial distribution of the dispersion measure of millisecond pulsars. This single observation has had little follow-up in subsequent years, because the method requires (a) a large population of millisecond pulsars and (b) a low foreground of ionized material. This combination is, at present, still only satisfied for 47 Tuc. Nonetheless, Abbate et al. (2018) revisit the measurement for this well-studied cluster with updated pulsar parameters, finding an even larger gas density than that in the original paper (n\\n\\ne\\n = 0.23 ± 0.05 cm−3, compared to ∼0.07 cm−3). This measurement is consistent with theory and supports the basic underpinning of the accretion-based mass constraints: Globular clusters should have some amount of gas that is available to be accreted by an IMBH. Other routes to fueling at higher rates are also available, such as winds or tidally stripped material from binary companion stars acquired dynamically (MacLeod et al. 2016b).',\n",

X-ray sources are observed at this L\\nX but are identified as individual X-ray binaries rather than IMBHs.

Assuming radiatively inefficient accretion and the sub-Bondi accretion rates observed for nearby low-luminosity AGNs (e.g., Pellegrini 2005), many papers have used the fundamental plane and radio upper limits to set stringent constraints on the presence of accreting IMBHs in globular clusters (Maccarone et al. 2005, Maccarone & Servillat 2008, Cseh et al. 2010, Lu & Kong 2011, Strader et al. 2012).',\n",

No emission consistent with an IMBH was observed for any cluster or for a cluster stack, including clusters with dynamical IMBH claims, such as ω Cen, M54, and NGC 6388 (see above). For the clusters with more sensitive VLA data, using the assumed formalism, the median 3σ upper limit to an IMBH is \\n\\n1,100 M⊙, which corresponds to very low accretion rate upper limits of less than about a few ×10−11M⊙ year−1.',\n",
       " 'There are plausible mechanisms that could temporarily remove all gas from the immediate vicinity of the IMBH, rendering it invisible in radio continuum emission. Hence, the lack of radio emission alone does not definitively prove the absence of an IMBH in a particular cluster. However, scatter in the accretion rate and efficiency is expected in both directions, so if IMBHs were common, at least some obvious sources would be observed. They are not.',\n",

(2018), their nondetections set a 3σ upper limit of 10–15% on the fraction of such massive globular clusters that could host ∼1,000-M⊙ black holes just based on Poisson statistics. The modest size of the Galactic globular cluster system overall makes it challenging to substantially improve this limit on the occupation fraction with future data, except to push to fainter emission levels and hence lower (or more conservative) mass limits. Deep X-ray observations can also provide complementary constraints if the observing times are sufficiently long (Grindlay et al. 2001, Haggard et al. 2013).',\n",

       " 'TDEs are the electromagnetic signature that may result if a star passes within its tidal radius of a black hole (e.g., Rees 1988). TDEs are powered by accretion onto massive black holes, but their rates and environments provide an independent probe of the space density of IMBHs, because the rates depend on stellar (rather than gas) dynamics. In principle it is possible to derive M\\nBH from modeling of the TDE light curve itself (Lodato et al. 2009, Guillochon & Ramirez-Ruiz 2013, Mockler et al. 2019), as the emission from these events depends on both the mass and radius of the star and the mass of the black hole (e.g., Law-Smith et al. 2017). The TDE literature merits its own review; we focus here only on aspects that may bear directly on IMBH demographics.',\n",

We also note an X-ray-detected transient that is a likely TDE with an M\\nBH–σ\\\\*-based mass estimate of 1.3–6.3 × 105 M⊙ (Maksym et al. 2013). If the M\\nBH–σ\\\\* relation can be extrapolated below σ\\\\*∼100 km s−1 (we provide direct support for this in Section 8), then it is very likely some <106-M⊙ black holes have already produced detectable TDEs.',\n",
       " '\\nVan Velzen (2018) goes a step further and claims that a constant black hole occupation fraction from stellar masses M\\n\\\\* ≈ 5 × 109 M⊙ to 3 × 1010 M⊙ is required to reproduce the observed TDE rate as a function of mass. This result highlights the promise of TDE observations to independently constrain the occupation fraction and is consistent with our inferences from dynamics (Section 3) and X-ray observations of local galaxies (Section 4) above. That said, to fully utilize the promise of TDEs, some key assumptions need to be explicitly checked. We do not know how TDE rates in low-mass galaxies may depend on star-formation rate or galaxy structure, although we know that TDE rates in more massive galaxies are a function of galaxy properties (e.g., Arcavi et al. 2014). Another open question is whether the TDE emission properties depend systematically on M\\nBH in a way that biases the mass distributions of samples as a function of their selection (e.g., Strubbe & Quataert 2009). Finally, for white dwarf disruptions, there is interesting literature comparing the emission signatures to those of type Ia supernovae (Rosswog et al. 2009, MacLeod et al. 2016a, Anninos et al. 2018). These events are particularly exciting because they could be accompanied by the gravitational wave signature of an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (Section 6.2).',\n",
       " 'TDE rates are so uncertain that in theory, all AGN activity in low-mass galaxies may be powered by TDEs, and most black hole mass density at low mass may be built up through tidal capture and TDEs (Milosavljević et al. 2006, MacLeod et al. 2016a, Stone et al. 2017, Zubovas 2019). Zubovas in particular claims that the AGN fraction matches TDE expectations at low mass by assuming (a) rates from Stone & Metzger (2016) and (b) unity occupation fraction. It should be possible to use multiepoch observations of active nuclei in low-mass galaxies to test whether they fade, as would be expected for TDEs, but at present our time baselines of ∼10 years are too short to be discriminating (e.g., Baldassare et al. 2016, 2018). On the positive side, Jonker et al. (2019) present some hopeful evidence for persistent (5–10 years) X-ray emission from optically identified TDEs, suggesting that eROSITA may find as many as thousands of TDEs powered by low-mass black holes.',\n",
       " \"In theory there may be numerous off-nuclear IMBHs living in globular clusters or wandering with only a small number of tightly bound stars (O'Leary & Loeb 2012, Fragione et al. 2018), which may give rise to off-nuclear TDEs observed as peculiar transients. For instance, there is a class of rapid blue transients (e.g., Drout et al. 2014, Vinkó et al. 2015, Tanaka et al. 2016, Pursiainen et al. 2018, Perley et al. 2019) that are not easily explained as standard classes of supernovae. These do not occur in galaxy centers nor do they quite look like TDEs. Various groups have suggested that the object presented by Vinkó et al. (2015) may be powered by the tidal disruption of a white dwarf (e.g., Law-Smith et al. 2017). By contrast, Margutti et al. (2019) argue that AT2018cow (Perley et al. 2019) has too much circumstellar material to be explained by an IMBH TDE (although see also Kuin et al. 2019).\",\n",
       " 'Another class of TDE candidate is associated with off-nuclear sources that show transient X-ray emission, often ascribed to a large temporary increase in the accretion rate of the putative IMBH associated with a TDE. Perhaps the most compelling of these is 3XMM J215022.4–055108, which is an X-ray source associated with a z ∼ 0.06 lenticular galaxy (Lin et al. 2018). This source shows a TDE-like X-ray light curve measured over 10 years, with a luminosity of at least 1043 erg s−1. The X-ray source matches the position of a compact star cluster (possibly a stripped nucleus) with an old stellar population and a mass of ∼107M⊙. Fitting the X-ray spectra suggests a black hole mass of 5 × 104–105M⊙, depending on the unknown spin of the black hole. The position of the source on a diagram of luminosity and temperature for a standard thin accretion disk is very similar to that of HLX-1, suggesting a similar mass.',\n",
       " 'Other similar sources have been discovered (e.g., Lin et al. 2016, 2017), although the evidence for a TDE-like decay (rather than typical AGN activity) is less compelling owing to a smaller number of deep observations over time, and generally the masses of the associated black holes are more in the regime of normal low-mass central black holes (masses 105–106 M⊙) rather than in the IMBH regime. If TDEs associated with low-mass central black holes in stripped nuclei are as common as suggested by these recent works, then future sensitive X-ray missions such as the Athena X-Ray Observatory should confirm such sources in substantial quantities, with possible rates of up to ∼100 year−1 (Cassano et al. 2018, Lin et al. 2018).',\n",

One of the clusters appears to be a typical massive globular cluster, whereas the other has properties consistent with being a stripped nucleus. These X-ray sources show properties most similar to flares from young pulsars with strong magnetic fields—sources not expected to exist in old stellar populations. If the flares are Eddington-limited, then they could represent accretion onto IMBHs with masses of ∼100–1,000 M⊙. So far, these results are only suggestive, and other evidence (such as radio emission from the sources in their lower state) would be necessary to provide stronger evidence for an IMBH classification.',\n",

These measurements will provide insight into the seeding mechanisms and fueling rates (e.g., Sesana et al. 2011). However, in detail the rates will depend not only on the seeding mechanism(s) at play but also on the accretion history and the dynamics driving the mergers of the black holes (e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Klein et al. 2016). In practice it will not be trivial to disentangle these effects. Observations in the X-ray and optical/IR with missions like JWST and the Lynx X-ray Observatory that should detect the actively accreting 105–106 M⊙ black holes at similar epochs would be very complementary (e.g., Haiman et al. 2019; see Section 10).',\n",

In addition, an IMBH embedded in a star cluster (nuclear or otherwise) could merge with a stellar-mass black hole in an extreme-mass-ratio inspiral with even lower-mass ratios (e.g., Gair et al. 2010). Again, the rates of both events are heavily dependent on a number of unknown factors, including the spin of the black hole, the dynamics of the surrounding stellar cluster, and the number density of IMBHs (e.g., Amaro-Seoane et al. 2015, Fragione et al. 2018, Berry et al. 2019), which hopefully can be partially determined through complementary electromagnetic observations.',\n",

Current limits on the merger of ∼100-M⊙ black holes are not yet constraining (Abbate et al. 2018) but should become so as LIGO progresses. The one caveat relates to the possible subset of runaway processes involving stars (as opposed to black holes) that may require low metallicity.

We have already hit a confusion floor with X-ray observations because going deeper than ∼1038 erg s−1 simply yields large samples of low-mass X-ray binaries. In principle, incorporating radio observations could help. However, in nearly all accreting objects the X-ray and radio emission are linked in some manner, leading the fundamental plane to return a seemingly reasonable mass even in cases in which its use turns out later to have been not justified. For example, early discussions of ULXs argued that the fundamental plane might support their identification as IMBHs (e.g., Miller 2005, Kaaret et al. 2009), though at least some of these sources turned out to be pulsars.

There has been considerable literature on the scatter in scaling relations as a function of galaxy properties (Hopkins et al. 2007, Kormendy & Ho 2013, Saglia et al. 2016). We do not attempt to address these issues, because the measurement uncertainties are still very large in the low-mass systems that concern us here. Finally, because we need it for our black hole mass function determinations below, we also split the sample into early- (elliptical and S0) and late-type (spiral) galaxies, using the Hubble types from Saglia et al.

       " 'As for Kormendy & Ho (2013), we measure K-band magnitudes and B–V colors for the new galaxies. We use this single color and the fitting functions from Bell et al. (2003) to calculate M\\n\\\\* for all samples, so that all M\\n\\\\* estimates share a common initial mass function and stellar population assumptions. The one exception is the low-mass galaxies (M\\n\\\\* < 1010 M⊙), where we use the stellar masses from the dynamical papers. Nguyen et al. (2019b) gives a more detailed comparison of different color–M/L relations. All black hole mass measurements and stellar masses used in this fit are tabulated in \\nSupplemental Tables 2–4\\n.',\n",
       " 'In \\nFigure 3\\n (see also \\nSupplemental Table 5\\n), we present the updated M\\nBH–M\\n\\\\* scaling relation. One thing that is immediately apparent is that, when plotted against M\\n\\\\*, the dearth of dynamical black hole mass measurements for M\\n\\\\* < 3 × 1010 M⊙ is striking. A high priority for understanding black hole demographics at low M\\n\\\\* is studying the supermassive black hole demographics in Milky Way–mass galaxies (Krajnović et al. 2018, Nguyen et al. 2019a).',\n",
       " 'Focusing on the IMBH regime, again we find that without upper limits, the fit to late-type galaxies returns a very shallow relation, because the measured M\\nBH values are biased high. When we include the limits, however, the slope of the relation becomes consistent between the red and blue populations. By contrast, the overall normalization for the late-type galaxies is considerably lower than that for the early-type galaxies (in agreement with Greene et al. 2010, 2016; Reines & Volonteri 2015; Läsker et al. 2016). This difference has been interpreted to mean that black hole mass does not correlate with disk mass (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995), although the different trends have also been used to constrain the relationship between star formation and black hole growth (Caplar et al. 2015). We note that our fit to the full sample including limits has a lower normalization and slightly steeper slope than the Reines & Volonteri fit, whereas it is very similar to that presented recently by Gallo & Sesana (2019). We do not discuss the physical origins of the scaling relations, but see the sidebar titled Feedback.',\n",
       " 'FEEDBACKOne plausible explanation of black hole–galaxy scaling relations more generally is that there is a feedback loop between black hole growth and star formation, such that black holes are able to remove or heat gas in galaxies when they reach a critical mass relative to the galaxy potential (e.g., Silk & Rees 1998). For low-mass galaxies in particular, AGN feedback has largely been ignored. However, recent theoretical interest and observational evidence have brought the possibility of AGN feedback in dwarf galaxies to the fore.',\n",
       " '\\nSilk (2017) argues on theoretical grounds that AGN feedback in low-mass galaxies may be important to solve small-scale challenges for ΛCDM (see also Dashyan et al. 2018). Penny et al. (2018) present evidence for AGN activity in 10% of LMC-mass quenched galaxies. They interpret misaligned kinematics as signs of AGN-driven feedback. Manzano-King et al. (2019) also present some evidence that AGN outflows in dwarfs may be suppressing star formation. Dickey et al. (2019) examine 20 of the rare M\\n\\\\* ≈ 109-M⊙ galaxies that are both isolated and non-star-forming and find evidence for AGN activity in 16 of them (see also Bradford et al. 2018). Dickey et al. conclude that AGN activity can self-quench even relatively isolated low-mass galaxies that otherwise are blue (Geha et al. 2012). Nyland et al. (2017) also identify possible evidence for feedback in the jet in NGC 404. In short, there is now intriguing evidence that even dwarf galaxies with low-mass black holes may suffer the impacts of AGN feedback. We do not yet know whether these episodes are crucial in setting scaling relations in this regime.',\n",
       " 'We overplot the sample of low-mass AGNs from Xiao et al. (2011) in the M\\nBH–σ\\\\* plane (\\nFigure 3\\n; excluding those with uncertain broad lines). We adjust the single-epoch virial masses to an f\\nvir calibrated with late-type galaxies, as advocated by Ho & Kim (2014). By construction, the AGNs align with the late-type galaxy fit. We again see no evidence in the AGN sample for any flattening or offset at low mass, given the caveat that we do not know the absolute black hole masses of these objects. Given the large uncertainty in the single-epoch masses, we cannot make any additional statements about scatter from this sample.',\n",
       " 'More generally, we would urge extreme caution in using AGN signatures to infer scaling relations, particularly in this low-mass regime. Even the nearby AGN NGC 4395 (D ≈ 4 Mpc) has published reverberation-mapping masses that differ by more than an order of magnitude (Peterson et al. 2005, Edri et al. 2012, Woo et al. 2019). We do not yet know how to fully interpret reverberation-based masses. One problem is the f\\nvir uncertainty. Beyond that, in the case of NGC 4395, the disagreement in black hole mass is mostly attributable to different line widths between the UV resonance line Civ and the optical recombination line Hα. Much more work is needed to effectively harness reverberation mapping for AGNs with low-mass black holes.',\n",
       " 'In addition to scaling relations between galaxy properties and black hole mass, we consider possible scaling relations between the central black hole and the surrounding nuclear star cluster. We observe a high incidence of black holes in nuclear star clusters. As we argue below (Section 9), a fraction >50% of 109–1010-M⊙ galaxies harbor black holes, and nearly all such galaxies harbor nuclear star clusters. Nuclear star clusters do not seem to replace black holes as the central compact object (Ferrarese et al. 2006). Rather the two appear to coexist often at low galaxy mass (Seth et al. 2008). In contrast, most higher-mass galaxies contain supermassive black holes (Gültekin et al. 2011) but show a very low incidence of nuclear star clusters (e.g., Graham & Spitler 2009). Likely the growing black hole contributes to the demise of the nuclear star cluster (Antonini et al. 2019).',\n",
       " 'It is not obvious what (if any) causal relationship exists between black holes and nuclear star clusters. We have already discussed the possibility that black holes form via gravitational runaway processes in stellar clusters (Section 2) and the dearth of concrete observational evidence to date for black holes with M\\nBH > 1,000 M⊙ in globular clusters (Tremou et al. 2018, Section 5). Nuclear star clusters are different from globular clusters in four key ways: They have higher stellar densities (and thus higher interaction rates), they have longer relaxation times, they have deeper potential wells (and hence higher escape velocities), and they have well-documented multiage populations (e.g., Kacharov et al. 2018). Although some theoretical work postulated a higher likelihood of gravitational runaway in clusters with the highest σ\\\\* (Miller & Davies 2012), more recent work suggests that massive black holes likely can only form via rapid processes in nuclear star clusters (Breen & Heggie 2013, Stone et al. 2017).',\n",
       " 'Instead, the high coincidence of black holes and nuclear star clusters may suggest that globular clusters with IMBHs are more successful at surviving and migrating to a galaxy center, where through continued gas accretion they can become a nuclear star cluster. Or, the black hole may form early via other means (Section 2) and then grow along with the present-day nuclear star cluster.',\n",
       " 'Going beyond occupation fractions, the mass fraction of the cluster bound up in the black hole may constrain models. We extend the work by Seth et al. (2008), Zasov & Cherepashchuk (2013), Georgiev et al. (2016), and Nguyen et al. (2018) based on the increased number of dynamical black hole masses available now in the literature (\\nFigure 4\\n and \\nSupplemental Table 6\\n). Our full sample includes upper limits on M\\nBH in globular clusters from Tremou et al. (2018), ultracompact dwarfs with dynamical black hole mass measurements or upper limits (Seth et al. 2014; Ahn et al. 2017, 2018; Afanasiev et al. 2018), and dynamical black holes in low-mass galaxies (Section 3), drawing nuclear star cluster masses from those papers. For the black hole masses and limits of Krajnović et al. (2018) and Pechetti et al. (2017), we calculate the nuclear star cluster masses using color and luminosity information from Côté et al. (2006) and the relations of Bell et al. (2003). Finally, we include NGC 1023 and NGC 3384, two early-type galaxies that Lauer et al. (2005) identify as containing stellar nuclei, with the caveat that in some cases it can be challenging to determine whether these point sources are stellar or nonthermal in nature (e.g., Ravindranath et al. 2001).\\n',\n",

       " 'Roughly ∼0.1% mass fractions are predicted from gravitational runaway scenarios (Section 2). The observed mass fractions in nuclear star clusters far exceed these limits. We see from \\nFigure 4\\n that in most cases M\\nBH comprises a much higher fraction of the nuclear star cluster mass: The median value of M\\nBH/M\\nNSC for the objects with black hole detections is ∼0.3, with more than a factor of two scatter. There is even more scatter when the limits are considered. This scatter likely reflects both a lack of black holes in some clusters and intrinsic scatter in the growth histories of both constituents. Interestingly, the largest outliers with low ratios of black hole–to–nuclear star cluster mass are found in the low-mass and late-type spiral galaxies.',\n",
       " 'Given the wide range of M\\nBH/M\\nNSC that we observe, it seems possible that stochastic late-time fueling and/or merging plays a substantial role in the growth of each component (e.g., Naiman et al. 2015). Ultracompact dwarfs provide an interesting testing ground for how much black hole growth occurs via later-time accretion versus initial formation. Because ultracompact dwarfs were stripped, likely quite early in some cases (Pfeffer et al. 2014), we would expect less late-time growth, leaving their M\\nBH/M\\nNSC ratios closer to their value at formation, whereas there may be more scatter in the population due to different stripping times. So far, the ultracompact dwarfs do not obviously segregate in this plane, but the constraint will be more interesting as their number with M\\nBH constraints continues to grow.',\n",
       " 'After Gebhardt et al. (2001) published an upper limit of <1,500 M⊙ on any putative black hole in the nuclear star cluster in M33, the community assumed that massive black holes were rare in low-mass, late-type galaxies with little or no bulge component. In fact, black holes do not appear to be rare, at least in galaxies with 109 < M\\n\\\\*/M⊙ < 1010.',\n",

From the dynamical measurements, we infer an occupation fraction >50% (\\nFigure 5\\n).

Miller et al. argue for a likely occupation fraction of ∼70% based on jointly modeling the L\\nX/M\\n\\\\* relation and the occupation fraction. Taking ∼20% as the lower limit, we find that sensitive X-ray surveys of local galaxies already point toward relatively high occupation fractions, which is in agreement with the dynamics (\\nFigure 5\\n).',\n",

As yet, we see no concrete evidence for differences in mass distribution between red and blue low-mass galaxies in this stellar-mass regime, which also appears to hold for the X-ray detection fractions described above Section 4. Given the small numbers involved, we cannot test for a difference yet. Because blue galaxies are far more common than red galaxies at these masses, any difference could have significant ramifications for the black hole mass density.',\n",
       " 'The growing field of tidal disruptions will soon start to put competitive constraints on the occupation fraction if we can understand the rates (Section 6). Van Velzen (2018) makes a first attempt. He finds that the observed luminosity function of TDEs can only be explained if the occupation fraction is basically flat from LMC- to Milky Way–mass galaxies. Although this result is hard to turn into an exact occupation fraction, it certainly argues that a high fraction of galaxies in this mass range host an IMBH.',\n",
       " 'As a point of comparison, we also plot the fraction of Virgo galaxies with M\\n\\\\* < 109 M⊙ containing nuclear star clusters (Sánchez-Janssen et al. 2019). It is interesting to see that if most nuclear star clusters host a central black hole, then the black hole occupation fraction would be within the limits derived by other methods (see also Seth et al. 2008, Foord et al. 2017). Below, when we calculate limits on the black hole mass function, we use the measured nuclear star cluster fraction as one estimate of the black hole occupation fraction for illustrative purposes. We also show predictions from recent models for the occupation fraction (\\nFigure 5\\n). The Ricarte & Natarajan (2018) models with Pop III seeds span nearly all possible occupation fractions, depending on their fueling model (\\nFigure 5\\n), whereas the direct-collapse models lie in between, consistent with (Bellovary et al. 2019).

However, there are few observational constraints on the M\\nBH mass function below ∼106 M⊙ (e.g., Marconi et al. 2004, Greene & Ho 2007c). We now have the ingredients needed to calculate a range of possible black hole mass functions down to ∼104 M⊙, albeit with significant uncertainty.',\n",

The mass function of Wright et al. (2017) extends to M\\n\\\\*≈ 106 M⊙ and thus allows us to explore the ramifications of a nonzero occupation fraction to very low stellar mass. The galaxy stellar mass is converted into black hole mass density using the M\\nBH–M\\n\\\\* relation that we fitted in Section 8, including intrinsic scatter. We consider the red and blue galaxies separately, because they have different scaling zero points (see also Shankar et al. 2016), and for this we take guidance from the red- and blue-galaxy luminosity functions presented by Blanton & Moustakas (2009).

As a pessimistic case, we assume that the occupation fraction drops linearly from unity at 1010 to 0 at 3 × 107 M⊙. As an optimistic limit, we take the fraction of galaxies with nuclear star clusters and assume that every nuclear star cluster harbors a massive black hole (derived in Virgo by Sánchez-Janssen et al. 2019). In the default mass function, there are only nuclear black holes and a single power-law relation between stellar and black hole masses.

These black holes may reveal themselves in our own Galaxy through dynamical signatures, and they may be the sites of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals or white dwarf TDEs as well. We tie the number of wandering black holes to the number of ultracompact dwarfs, as described in Section 2.1. In short, we take the number of ultracompact dwarfs as a proxy for the number of disrupted satellites and then assume a 10–50% occupation fraction for them. We are not adopting a cosmologically motivated mass spectrum of satellites, nor do we have an empirical way to assign black hole masses to this population. The ultracompact dwarfs with known black holes orbit more massive hosts and likely had more massive progenitors than those we consider here (Seth et al. 2014, Voggel et al. 2019). Thus, we simply take a typical black hole mass of 3 × 103 M⊙, chosen to fall below current detection limits, and a log-normal width of 0.5 dex. These are arbitrary, but they at least qualitatively demonstrate how much higher the black hole mass density might be for relatively conservative estimates on wandering populations.',\n",

Furthermore, we do not know the functional form of the occupation fraction with stellar mass. Because the stellar-mass function rises steeply, even a small occupation fraction in low-mass galaxies dramatically changes the black hole mass density at low mass.

We must use all the tools at our disposal, from astrometry with Gaia to gas kinematics, to determine centers for Local Group dwarfs (van der Marel & Kallivayalil 2014). Moving out to larger radii, a complete sample of nuclear star clusters within 5 Mpc would be immensely useful in planning for next-generation dynamical searches. Likewise a survey of the molecular gas content of <109-M⊙ galaxies in the south to identify good ALMA targets is needed.

Because red and blue galaxies have very different number densities at low mass, it is important to know if there are differences in their occupation fractions.',\n",

We urgently need theoretical predictions for the spectral energy distributions and presence or absence of broad lines in 103–105-M⊙ black holes (e.g., Cann et al. 2019) to search effectively for them with upcoming sensitive instruments like JWST and/or Lynx. Standard AGN search techniques have identified targets with inferred masses pushing toward 104 M⊙ (e.g., Baldassare et al. 2015), but we may be unable to identify the majority of sources at this black hole mass because their accretion signatures do not match our expectations (Cann et al. 2019).

Such objects are also highly variable (Kamizasa et al. 2012). Along with this, the ratio of optical–to–X-ray emission also shows interesting behavior among the low-mass black holes (e.g., Dong et al. 2012a, Plotkin et al. 2016), but these changes may be tied more closely to the high Eddington ratios rather than low masses of this sample.
