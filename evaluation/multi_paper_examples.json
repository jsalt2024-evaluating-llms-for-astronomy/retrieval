            "paragraph": "In this review, we adopt a constant FUV conversion factor \n\n year\u22121 erg\u22121 s Hz (we typically leave out the units) as a compromise value based on the evolutionary scenario from \nFigure 3\n. The widely used value from Kennicutt (1998) (and based on the calibration by Madau et al. 1998b), \n\n, is 20% larger than our calibration. Other recent analyses based on the GALAXEV libraries have also found lower mean conversion factors, for both low- and high-redshift galaxy populations (e.g., Salim et al. 2007, Haardt & Madau 2012). The FUV conversion tabulated in Kennicutt & Evans (2012) (from Murphy et al. 2011), if rescaled from the Kroupa to Salpeter IMF, is very close to the z = 0 solar metallicity value of \n\n in \nFigure 3\n, but our somewhat smaller value should be more representative for the peak era of cosmic star formation at high redshift. Some authors express FUV luminosity as L\nFUV=\u03bdL\n\u03bd in solar units. In that case, \n\n at 1,500 \u00c5, and the conversion factor will depend on the wavelength.",

            "question": " How do the infrared spectral energy distributions of galaxies at high redshift compare to local templates, and what are the implications for deriving star formation rates from mid-infrared observations?",
            "paragraph": "In practice, observations of IR-luminous galaxies detected at high redshift with both Spitzer and Herschel have demonstrated that the IR SEDs for many galaxies are well behaved and that variations can be understood at least in part. Several pre-Herschel studies (Daddi et al. 2007; Papovich et al. 2007; Magnelli et al. 2009, 2011) compared 24-\u03bcm observations of distant galaxies with those of other SFR tracers, including Spitzer FIR measurements (either individual detections or stacked averages) and radio emission. On average, the MIR to FIR flux ratios for galaxies at z\u22721.3 match those predicted by local IR SED templates such as those of Chary & Elbaz (2001), implying that 24-\u03bcm-derived SFRs should be reliable. However, at higher redshift, 1.31011\nL\n\u2299 and >1012\nL\n\u2299, respectively) are merger-driven starbursts, but at z\u22482 where the SFRs and sSFRs of galaxies are globally much larger, the majority of LIRGs and ULIRGs are \u201cnormal\u201d main-sequence galaxies. Their IR SEDs are more similar to those of ordinary, local star-forming spiral galaxies and have smaller bolometric corrections from observed 24-\u03bcm data (rest frame \u03bb \u22488 \u03bcm) than those predicted by SED templates designed to match local LIRGs and ULIRGs. Elbaz et al. (2011) constructed a \u201cuniversal\u201d main-sequence SED from the ensemble of high-z Spitzer and Herschel photometry for galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) fields at 0.3<z<2.5. This SED leads to consistent total IR luminosities for the large majority of galaxies over that redshift range. Although no single template can be used to accurately derive L\nIR or SFR from MIR observations for all galaxies, we now have a better understanding of how this can be done on average, which may be sufficient for deriving the global redshift evolution of the IR luminosity density or its corresponding SFRD. Rodighiero et al. (2011) (see also Sargent et al. 2012) showed that starbursts (whose IR SEDs deviate significantly from those of the main-sequence population) account for only 10% of the global SFRD at z\u22482. With the data now available from Herschel and Spitzer, a broad understanding of the evolving IRLF and IR luminosity density, at least at 0<z<2.5, seems within reach.",

            "question": " How does dust attenuation in high-redshift galaxies compare to local galaxies, and what are the limitations of using the UV spectral slope to estimate extinction?",
            "paragraph": "Attempts to measure and correct for dust extinction in high-z galaxies have generally used the UV spectral slope (designated \u03b2) as a measure of UV reddening and have adopted empirical correlations between UV reddening and UV extinction. Calzetti et al. (1994, 2000) used ultraviolet and optical spectroscopy to derive an empirical, average dust attenuation curve for a sample of local UV-bright star-forming galaxies. Meurer et al. (1999) (later updated by Overzier et al. 2011) used UV and FIR data for a similar local sample to empirically calibrate the relation between UV reddening (\u03b2) and UV extinction (IRX\u2261L\nIR/L\nFUV, which can be directly related to A\nFUV). The reasonably tight IRX-\u03b2 relation obeyed by the local UV-bright galaxies is broadly consistent with the Calzetti attenuation law, hence reinforcing its popularity. However, other local studies showed clearly that some galaxies deviate from these relations. Goldader et al. (2002) found that nearby ULIRGs deviate strongly from the Meurer IRX-\u03b2 relation; these ULIRGs have very large values of IRX but often with relatively blue UV spectral index \u03b2. This was interpreted to mean that the observed UV light from local ULIRGs is relatively unreddened star formation in the host galaxy that is unrelated to the bolometrically dominant star formation, which is entirely obscured from view at UV-optical wavelengths and detected only in the FIR. Instead, observations of ordinary spiral galaxies (Kong et al. 2004, Buat et al. 2005) measured redder values of \u03b2 for a given IRX. This is generally taken as evidence that light from older and less massive stars contributes significantly to the near-UV emission, leading to redder UV colors for reasons unrelated to extinction. In general, different relative distributions of stars and dust can lead to different net attenuation properties. Extinction can easily be patchy: Winds from star-forming regions can blow away dust on certain timescales, whereas other regions that are younger or more deeply embedded in the galaxy's ISM remain more heavily obscured. Dust heating also depends on geometry, leading to different distributions of dust temperatures and different emission spectra at IR and submillimeter wavelengths.",
