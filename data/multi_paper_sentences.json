    "text": "Energy deposition.\n\nA large amount of extra energy can be deposited deep in a massive star's envelope by a number of suggested mechanisms, including unsteady burning (the pulsational pair instability (PPI , 2007other explosive shell burning instabilities (, wave-driven mass loss ( and stellar collisions or mergers in a binary system ( ). [Soker and collaborators discussed a model to power the luminosity in LBV eruptions using accretion onto a companion star (but this invokes an eruption to provide the mass that is then accreted it does not explain what initiates the mass loss from the primary in the first place.] Although any of these provide a plausible result, the main criticism for explaining LBV eruptions is that the mechanisms that are related to late nuclear burning instabilities are expected to occur only in the few years preceding core collapse.",
