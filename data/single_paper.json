        "question": "What is the average metallicity of RR Lyrae stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud, according to recent spectroscopic measurements?",
        "introduction": "RR~Lyrae stars are old \n($t \\ga 10^{10}$ yr), \nmetal-poor \n($-2.5< \\mathrm{[Fe/H]}<-0.5$)\npulsating variables.\nThey are one of the most important steps in the distance ladder, and are\nalso one of the best tracers of the primordial populations of the Milky Way.\nTheir characteristic light curves make them easy to find in large microlensing\nsurveys like the MACHO Project.\n\n\n\nStudies of the LMC kinematics (Alves \\& Nelson 2000, Graff et al. 2000,\nGyuk et al. 2000, Hardy et al. 2001, van der Marel et al. 2002)\nsuggest that if they lie in a disk, like\nthe globular clusters, the RR Lyrae stars would show fairly rapid\nsystemic rotation (about $\\pm40$ km s$^{-1}$), and a velocity\ndispersion of about $15-30$ km s$^{-1}$.\nIf they belong to a metal-poor halo, then the rotation will be low and the\nvelocity dispersion will be about $50$ km s$^{-1}$.\n\nWalker (1992) measured the abundances of 182 RR Lyrae stars from \nthe period-amplitude\nrelation in seven LMC clusters  (NGC\\,2257, Reticulum, NGC\\,1841, NGC\\,1466,\nNGC\\,1766, NGC\\,2210, NGC\\,1835). They fall in the interval -1.7 to -2.3, with\nthe mean value [Fe/H]=$-1.9\\pm0.2$ dex.  \nRecently, Clementini et al.

        "question": "What is the critical threshold value of the fractional mass excess within an overdense region that determines whether a primordial black hole will form in the early universe?",
        "introduction": "\\label{intro}\n Cosmological structure formation is thought to have resulted from the\ngrowth and evolution of small perturbations initiated at the time of\ninflation (see \\cite{Liddle2} and references therein). Inflationary models\ngive rise to a spectrum of fluctuations on scales larger than the\ncosmological horizon which then start to re-enter the horizon in the\nradiation-dominated era. Primordial black holes (PBHs) could be formed at\nthis stage in extreme cases where the fluctuation amplitude exceeds a\ncritical threshold value \\cite{Zeldovich,Hawking,Carr1}. The masses of\nthese PBHs could, in principle, span many orders of magnitude, from the\nPlanck mass up to the horizon mass at the time of equivalence between\nradiation and matter ($\\sim 10^4$ years after the Big Bang).\n\nSufficiently small PBHs would have emitted a significant amount of Hawking\nradiation and, according to the standard picture, would have evaporated\ncompletely away before now if their mass was less than $\\sim 10^{15}$ g.  \nIt has been suggested that extremely small PBHs of $\\sim 10^5 - 10^6$ g,\nformed in the very early Universe, might have been the cause of\nbaryogenesis \\cite{Nagatani}, while PBHs of $\\sim 10^{15}$ g evaporating\nnow might explain a class of observed very short-duration gamma ray bursts\n\\cite{Cline1,Cline2,Green2} and some cosmic rays \\cite{Carr4, Barrau}. It\nhas also been suggested that the evaporation of small black holes might\nnot continue all the way to zero mass but might stop in the region of the\nPlanck mass, and that surviving PBH remnants might explain some or all of\nthe current cold dark matter \\cite{McGibbon,Blais,Afshordi}.\n\nLarger PBHs with masses well above $\\sim 10^{15}$ g could be observable by\nmeans of gravitational effects such as their contribution to the\ncosmological density parameter \\cite{Carr2,Kim1}, gravitational radiation\nemitted from coalescing binary PBH systems \\cite{Nakamura} or\nmicro-lensing (PBHs were suggested as possible candidates for some of the\nobjects observed by the MACHO Collaboration \\cite{MACHO} and subsequent\nsurveys, although the idea that they might comprise a significant fraction\nof the halo dark matter is now no longer favoured \\cite{Green4,Rahvar}).  \nAll of these aspects have been studied and constraints obtained both on\nthe fraction of matter in the Universe that could now be in the form of\nPBHs and also on the spectral index of fluctuations on small scales\n\\cite{Carr3,Green1,Liddle1,Kribs,Bringmann}.\n\nIn this article, we present results from general relativistic numerical\nsimulations of PBH formation in the background of an expanding universe in\nthe radiation-dominated era. There have been a number of previous studies\nof this type and our aim here is to re-visit the subject area,\nhighlighting some features which we think are important and interesting. A\nparticular aspect of our study is that we use initial perturbations\nrepresenting growing-mode overdensities with length-scales larger than\nthe horizon and still within the linear regime. Their evolution is\nthen followed as they subsequently become nonlinear. A convenient\nparameter for measuring perturbation amplitudes is the fractional\nmass-excess within the overdense region (denoted by $\\delta$); if this is\ngreater than a critical value $\\delta_c$ (super-critical perturbations),\nthe following nonlinear evolution will result in formation of a black\nhole, whereas if it is smaller than $\\delta_c$ (sub-critical\nperturbations), the overdensity will eventually disperse back into the\nsurrounding medium. Determining the value of $\\delta_c$ is very important\nfor the cosmological considerations mentioned above.\n\nFollowing the earliest papers on this subject \\cite{Zeldovich,Hawking,\nCarr1}, Carr (1975) \\cite{Carr2} carried out a quantitative study based on\na simplified model consisting of an overdense collapsing region, described\nby a closed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) spacetime, surrounded by a\nspatially-flat FRW expanding background. For a radiation-dominated\nuniverse, his calculation gave $\\delta_c = 1/3$ and the black holes formed\nhad masses $M_{BH}$ of the same order as the horizon mass at the time when\nthe fluctuation first entered the horizon. Nadezhin, Novikov \\& Polnarev\n(1978) \\cite{Nadezhin} carried out the first detailed numerical study of\nPBH formation using a hydrodynamical computer code similar to those of May\n\\& White (1966) \\cite{May} and Podurets (1964) \\cite{Podurets} using a\n``cosmic-time'' coordinate with a diagonal metric which reduces to a form\nsimilar to that of the FRW metric in the absence of perturbations. A\nwell-known difficulty with this approach is that in a continuing collapse,\nsingularities typically appear rather quickly and stop the computation\nbefore the black hole formation is complete. In \\cite{Nadezhin}, this\ndifficulty was overcome by using an early form of excision with the\nevolution being stopped in the region where the singularity would appear.\nThe qualitative features of the earlier picture were basically confirmed\nbut it was found that the PBH masses were always much smaller than the\nhorizon mass.\n\nShortly afterwards, Bicknell \\& Henriksen (1979) \\cite{Bicknell} carried\nout related calculations using a method based on integration along\nhydrodynamical characteristics which avoids the problems associated with\nthe appearance of singularities. They used rather different initial data\nfrom that of \\cite{Nadezhin} and found formation of black holes with\nmasses of the same order as the horizon mass (or greater in cases where\nthe overdensity in the initial perturbation was not compensated by a\nsurrounding under-dense region). They noted the appearance of both ingoing\nand outgoing compression waves during evolutions leading to black hole\nformation. \n\nMore recently, Niemeyer \\& Jedamzik \\cite{Niemeyer1,Niemeyer2} made\nfurther numerical calculations, particularly focusing on the relevance of\nscaling-laws for PBH formation. They found that $M_{BH}$ follows a power\nlaw in $(\\delta - \\delta_c)$ when the latter is sufficiently small, which\nis a similar behaviour to that seen in critical collapse by Choptuik\n\\cite{Choptuik} and many subsequent authors (see Evans \\& Coleman\n\\cite{Evans} and the review by Gundlach \\cite{Gundlach}). They started\nfrom initial perturbations specified at the moment when the overdensity\nenters the horizon and then computed the subsequent evolution. They used a\nnull-slicing code, following the formulation by Hernandez \\& Misner (1966)\n\\cite{Hernandez}, and obtained $\\delta_c \\simeq 0.7$ for each of the three\ntypes of perturbation profile which they studied.\n\nWhile Niemeyer \\& Jedamzik \\cite{Niemeyer2} demonstrated the existence of\na scaling law for PBH masses down to around one tenth of the horizon mass,\nthey did not investigate smaller masses and so it was not possible to\ndetermine whether the scaling law was likely to continue down to\nvanishingly small masses (when $\\delta \\to \\delta_c$) as in type II\ncritical collapse. In fact, the calculations become very challenging from\na numerical point of view when $\\delta$ is very close to $\\delta_c$\nbecause of the appearance of strong shocks and deep voids outside the\nregion where the PBH is forming. Hawke \\& Stewart (2002) \\cite{Hawke}\naddressed this problem using a sophisticated purpose-built code which\nallowed them to make calculations for values of $\\delta$ closer to\n$\\delta_c$ and to handle the strong shocks which occur in these cases.\nThey found that the scaling law does {\\em not} continue down to very small\nvalues of $(\\delta - \\delta_c)$ but rather reaches a minimum value for\n$M_{BH}$ around $10^{-4}$ of the horizon mass, with the limit resulting\nfrom the behaviour of the shocks produced in nearly critical collapse. \n\nShibata \\& Sasaki (1999) \\cite{Shibata} presented an alternative formalism\nfor studying PBH formation using constant mean curvature time slicing and\nfocusing on metric perturbations rather than density perturbations. They\nemphasised the importance of using initial data which can be directly\nrelated to perturbations arising from inflation. Their formulation was not\nrestricted to spherical symmetry (as had been the case for the previous\nauthors mentioned here) but they presented results only from spherical\ncalculations. They located the threshold perturbation amplitude for PBH\nformation (in terms of the metric perturbation) and found that this varied\nconsiderably depending on the density of the medium surrounding the\ndensity peak. They concluded from this that it is probably important to\ntake into account spatial correlations of density fluctuations when\nconsidering PBH formation.\n\nIt is not straightforward to make the link between results from this type\nof calculation and ones from the more standard approach focused on\ndensity fluctuations. However, this was addressed in a recent paper by\nGreen et al. (2004) \\cite{Green3}. They calculated the PBH abundance\nproduced from two different fluctuation spectra, using peaks theory\ntogether with the threshold criterion of Shibata \\& Sasaki \\cite{Shibata}.  \nThey then compared the results of this with ones obtained from a standard\ncalculation based on a Press-Schechter-like approach and using density\nperturbations. They found that the Shibata \\& Sasaki results are\nconsistent with ones using a density perturbation if $\\delta_c$ lies in\nthe range $0.3 \\ltord \\delta_c \\ltord 0.5$ and they noted the discrepancy\nwith the results of \\cite{Niemeyer2}.\n\nAs mentioned previously, our aim in the work described in this paper was\nto re-visit some issues arising from these earlier calculations. In\nparticular, we wanted to check on the scaling laws found in\n\\cite{Niemeyer2} and to investigate the effect on them both of starting\nthe initial perturbations earlier, as pure growing modes within the linear\nregime, and also of including vacuum energy (as a cosmological constant\nterm). For our calculations, we used a null-slicing code, modified from\nthat of Miller \\& Motta (1989) \\cite{Miller1}, which implements an\nessentially identical method to that used in \\cite{Niemeyer2} (but with\none key technical difference which we discuss in Section 2). This is not\nas sophisticated in its treatment of the hydrodynamics as the Hawke \\&\nStewart code \\cite{Hawke} but is satisfactory for our purposes and has\nsome useful advantages particularly as regards the specification of\ninitial conditions. We have examined both super-critical and sub-critical\nperturbations. The most notable results are: {\\it (i)} we find good\nagreement with the results of \\cite{Niemeyer2} when we use the same\ninitial data; {\\it (ii)} we obtain $\\delta_c \\simeq 0.45$ when we use\ninitial data specified as purely growing-mode perturbations, consistent\nwith the results of Green et al. \\cite{Green3}; {\\it (iii)} when a\ncosmological constant term $\\Lambda$ is included, $\\delta_c$ increases\nlinearly with increasing $\\Lambda$; {\\it (iv)} subcritical collapse with\n$\\delta$ sufficiently close to $\\delta_c$ produces strong compressions and\nrarefactions before the overdensity subsides back into the surrounding\nmedium.\n\nThe organisation of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review the\nmathematical formulation of the problem and the calculation method used;\nSection 3 presents results from our calculations of PBH formation and\nsub-critical collapse; Section 4 contains discussion and conclusions. We\nuse units for which $c = G = 1$ except where otherwise stated."

        "question": "What is the typical timescale for observing the variation of an emission line with the spin-cycle of a magnetic white dwarf in a cataclysmic variable star?",
        "introduction": "Given that interactions of an accretion disc with a\nmagnetosphere are widespread in astrophysics, one can\nask why it is of particular interest to study those\nin close binary systems such as the cataclysmic variable\nstars.  One answer is that these systems often show\na great range of observational clues.  Periodic and\nquasi-periodic behaviour, often on timescales that\nare easy to study, is the speciality of\ncataclysmic variables, making them prime systems\nfor advancing our understanding of accretion.\n\nIf you\nwant to see how an emission line varies with the\nspin-cycle of a magnetic white dwarf in a CV,\nrepeated 10 times for reliability, you need only\nwatch for three hours, and the fossil field of the\nwhite dwarf will not have changed.  In contrast,\nthe same task for a YSO would take weeks, and the\ndynamo-driven field might be changing over that time. \nFurther, the field of the white dwarf is more likely\nto be a simple dipole, and thus easier to model.\n\nIn this review I make an observationally led overview\nof the disc--field interactions in cataclysmic\nvariables.  I consider, first, the nature of an\naccretion flow in the presence of a magnetic field,\nand whether a disc forms, and then turn to how\nthe disc interacts with the field.   For a\ntheoretical account of these topics see Li (1999) or\nFrank, King \\&\\ Raine (2002).  The definitive review of \ncataclysmic variable stars is Warner (1995), while for \na shorter introduction see Hellier (2001).\n\nOne big difference from the situation in YSOs is\nthat in close binaries the accretion originates\nin a stream from the secondary star through the inner\nLagrangian point ($L_{1}$).  In cataclysmic variables\nwith a highly magnetic white dwarf (exceeding $\\sim$\\,30 MG)\nthe white dwarf is phase-locked to the orbit.  In such\nstars (called AM~Her stars or polars) the\nballistic stream becomes magnetically controlled and\nis channelled onto a magnetic pole of the white dwarf.\nSince this situation is least similar to YSOs I will\nnot deal with it here, though for accounts see \nWickramasinghe \\&\\ Ferrario (2000) and Schwope \\etal\\ (2004). \n\nIn a handful of AM~Her stars the white dwarf is\nslightly asynchronous with the orbit, despite a high\nmagnetic field.  Perhaps these stars have been\nknocked out of synchronism by a recent nova eruption\n(e.g.\\ Schmidt \\&\\ Stockman 1991). The trajectory of the \nstream will now change on the `beat' cycle between the spin and\norbital cycles, as the relative orientation of the\ndipole changes.  Typically the accretion stream\nflips from one pole to the other and back on the\nbeat cycle (10--50 days), though at any one time\nthe star will look like an AM~Her with magnetically\nchannelled stream accretion.    For accounts of such\nstars see Ramsay \\etal\\ (2000), Ramsay \\&\\ Cropper (2002), \nStaubert \\etal\\ (2003) and Schwarz \\etal\\ (2005).  \n\n\nThe main focus of this review will be the `intermediate\npolars', which have weaker fields of 1--10 MG.   In\nthis regime the field is usually not strong enough to\nprevent an accretion disc from forming, but is strong\nenough to carve out the inner disc and for the\nmagnetosphere to dominate the observed characteristics.\nThe hallmark of IPs is X-ray flux from magnetically\nchannelled accretion onto the white dwarf, heavily\npulsed at the white-dwarf spin period. In some\nsystems we also see pulsed polarised light, though\nin many IPs the polarised light is too diluted by\nother parts of the system to be detected.   For an\nexcellent introduction to these stars see Patterson (1994)."

        "question": "What effect does the gas content of spiral galaxies in low-density clusters have on their oxygen abundance?",
        "introduction": "The effect of environment on galaxy evolution has long been a subject of intense research and debate \\citep[see review articles by][for a comprehensive discussion]{haynes84,boselli06}.  Known environmental effects include tidal encounters and mergers, altered morphologies, and stripping of gas from disks.  A natural question is whether the cluster environment has significant effects of the chemical evolution of galaxies.  This topic has received increasing attention in the last few years.  \\citet{skillman96} explore the effect of environment on chemical evolution for spirals in the Virgo cluster.  Examining H II region spectra from 9 Virgo spirals, they find the three most H I deficient objects to have O/H abundances 0.3-0.5 dex higher than their gas-normal counterparts.  They suggest that the abundance differential results in part from a lack of infall of metal-poor gas into the spirals in the cluster core.  \\citet{dors06} fit photoionization models to the Virgo data, confirming the abundance excess for O/H and N/O.  Other studies, involving large-scale spectroscopic surveys \\citep{cooper08,ellison09,zhang09}, see a qualitatively similar galactic metallicity dependence on local galaxy density or gas fraction.  \\citet{zhang09} analyze a sample of 800 galaxies in the HyperLeda catalog, concluding gas-poor galaxies display higher heavy-element content for a given stellar mass.  \\citet{petropoulo11} examine abundances of dwarf and spiral galaxies in the Hercules cluster, finding higher abundances in dwarf galaxies located in relatively dense environments.  \n\nWhile these results suggest a significant impact of cluster environment on chemical evolution, the number of detailed studies for individual clusters is small. This paper presents, for the Pegasus I cluster, a study analogous to the \\citet{skillman96} analysis of the Virgo cluster.  Pegasus I (hereafter referred to as Pegasus) is a low-density, low velocity dispersion cluster of redshift $\\sim$ 3900 km/s in the foreground of the Pisces-Perseus supercluster.  It displays weak X-ray emission, primarily concentrated around the two central ellipticals, without additional substructure \\citep[][Figure 1]{canizares86}.  Full details of the cluster's location and member galaxies can be found in \\citet{levy07}, including a comparison to Virgo in their Table 4.  A comprehensive comparison of the properties of the Pegasus galaxies to other nearby clusters is presented in \\citet{solanes01}.\n\nBecause the density of Pegasus is so low, the classical ram pressure stripping effect should not cause significant gas loss in the disks of member spirals.  Furthermore, \\citet{vigroux89} conclude that the cluster is in the early stages of gravitational collapse, which suggests that any environment-driven evolution should be in an early phase as well.  Nevertheless, \\citet{levy07} demonstrate that the Pegasus spirals are in fact experiencing H I loss as they fall into the cluster, suggesting mechanisms other than the classic ram pressure effect \\citep{gunn72} may be at work.  In a follow-up study, \\citet{rose10} find that star formation in Pegasus galaxies is suppressed with higher H I deficiency.   Given that the cluster environment has already caused noticeable changes in the gas content and star formation of these galaxies, one might expect changes in nebular abundance as well.  Using the VIRUS-P integral-field spectrograph \\citep{hill08} on the 2.7m Harlan J Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory, we have obtained spectra for six Pegasus spirals.  From the H II region spectra, we calculate radial O/H profiles, and examine the extent to which a metallicity offset can be seen between the gas-poor and gas-normal spirals.  We compare our results to those of \\citet{skillman96}, noting the difference in environments of Virgo and Pegasus.  We discuss the possible causes of the offset for Pegasus, and the potential implications for environment-driven chemical evolution in Virgo and other clusters."

        "question": "What is the primary obstacle to directly detecting companions or circumstellar disks in high-contrast imaging of nearby stars?",
        "introduction": "Direct imaging surveys of the close-in ($\\lesssim$ 1000AU) environments of nearby stars for companions and circumstellar disks are coming into maturity and returning spectacular results  \\citep{ldm07,ncb08,kgc08,mmb08,obh08, mgp08, mh09}. Much of the technical effort in high-contrast imaging centers around suppressing the overwhelming luminosity of the host star, and the residual speckle noise, largely caused by uncorrected aberrations in the incoming wave front. This quasi-static source of noise, an especially bad problem for ground-based efforts, is stable for minutes or hours \\citep{hos07} and is the largest obstacle to direct detection of companions or circumstellar disks \\citep{rwn99,slh02,mdn03,sfa07}. Many authors have suggested useful techniques for direct subtraction of speckle noise through image post processing \\citep{sf02,mld06,hos07}.  Another technique using a dual-channel imaging polarimeter can extract a polarized signal due to cirumstellar material (companions or a disk) from the array of unpolarized speckles \\citep{kpp01,p03,pgk04,obh08}.  The Lyot Project \\citep{osm03,odn04,soh07} employed this technique in addition to using a very high-order Adaptive Optics (AO) system \\citep{rn02} and a classical Lyot coronagraph working at the diffraction limit \\citep{l39,m96,skm01}.  \n\nIn this work, we carry out a sensitivity analysis for speckle suppression through polarimetry, and quantify the level of suppression (Section 2). In Section 3 we demonstrate the power of this technique with a detection of  the debris disk surrounding the nearby ($d$ = 72.8 $\\pm$ 1.7 pc), young (8 $\\pm$ 2 Myr) star HR 4796A (A0 V, $V$=5.78 mag, \\citet{j91,krw98,alm99,ssb99,v07}), achieved in the $H$-band from the ground. To our knowledge, this is the first high-contrast polarimetric near-IR image of the the HR 4796A disk obtained from a ground-based observatory.  This technique is especially well suited for regions of the image which are heavily dominated by speckle noise.  Although circumstellar disk imaging has largely been performed using space-based observatories \\citep{ksm00,shc04,kgc05,gkm07}, this paper demonstrates the power of speckle suppression and its ability to image circumstellar disks from ground-based observatories. \n\n\\begin{figure*}[ht]\n\\center\n\\resizebox{1.05\\hsize}{!}{\\includegraphics{fig1.ps}}\n  \\caption{A schematic illustration of the steps involved in the reduction of data taken with a dual-channel imaging polarimeter.

There are different observational hints converging towards\nthe turbulent character of the intra-cluster medium (ICM)\n(\\citealt{sfm04,cfj04,ev06,rcb05,rcb06}, but see also\n\\citealt{fsc03}). From an observational point of view, the next\ngeneration of X-ray observatories will be able to observe the Doppler\nshifts of emission lines of heavy ions due to bulk motions in the ICM,\nthus providing information about the turbulent state of the\nflow. Numerical studies predict that gas bulk motions and turbulence\nin the ICM can be a consequence of cluster merging\n\\citep{r98,nb99,t00,rs01,dvb05}. In their model, \\citet{ssh06}\nidentify three physical regimes for turbulence production and decay in\nclusters, the latest one being dominated by turbulent production in\nthe wakes of minor mergers.

The problem has also been addressed with\nsimplified setups, which allow a better control over the involved\nphysical parameters, in 2D \\citep{asp03,hcf03,afm04,xcd07} and 3D\nsimulations \\citep{t05a,t05b,afm05,afm07,dp07}. \n\nThe theoretical study of turbulence in the framework of full\ncosmological simulations is a challenging task and presents the\ntypical problems of numerical simulations of strongly clumped\nmedia. Adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is a viable tool for saving\ncomputational resources and modelling the large dynamic range in a\nproper way \\citep{n04}. The choice of the most suitable mesh\nrefinement criterion is thus a delicate compromise between following\nthe flow structure in the most accurate way and exploiting the\nadvantage of saving computational time and memory. \n\nThis study (Paper I) is the first part of a broader project on the\nphysics of galaxy clusters, focused on investigating the\ngeneration of turbulence in the ICM by means of AMR simulations. In\nPaper I, we present new AMR criteria that are\nmore suitable for resolving the production of turbulence than those\ncommonly used in cosmological simulations. They were tested in a\nsimple setup, reminiscent of a wind tube experiment, but designed in\norder to be representative of an idealised subcluster merger. This\ntest problem is a useful and controlled testbed for the new tools, far from\nthe complexity of a more realistic cosmological\nsimulation. Nevertheless, it is similar to previous studies\nof subcluster mergers and can provide useful insights about\nthe physics of the minor mergers, relevant for the generation of\nturbulence in the ICM. In contrast with earlier work, we focus\nour analysis on the turbulent wake of the subcluster rather than on\nthe cold front, showing the difference of the evolution of the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) resulting from the use of different\nAMR criteria. \n\nThe second step, described in \\citet{in08} (hereafter Paper II), is to apply the same tools to simulations of structure \nformation and to study the turbulent flow in the ICM. The\nresults of the present work will thus be compared with the outcomes of\nmore realistic simulations of minor mergers.  \n\nThe paper is structured as follows: the new refinement criteria are\ndefined in in Sec.~\\ref{simulations}. The numerical setup of the\nperformed simulations and the features of the KHI are introduced in\nSects.~\\ref{setup} and \\ref{theory}, respectively. The results are\npresented in Sec.~\\ref{results} and discussed in\nSec.~\\ref{discussion}."

        "introduction": "\\label{S-Introduction} \nMagnetic flux tubes couple the different layers of the solar\natmosphere, and waves propagating along the magnetic-field lines are a\npossible source of the mechanical-energy transport required to heat\nthe chromosphere and corona. The waves also provide a helioseismic\nmeans of constraining the properties of the magnetic tubes which is\ncomplementary to observational studies with SOHO/MDI data\n\\citep{Duvall06} and \\textit{Hinode} \\citep{Fujimura09}. In the latter work the\nauthors found that the observed Poynting flux is substantial when\ncompared to the flux required to heat the chromosphere and\ncorona. Unfortunately with observations at a single height they were\nunable to identify what mixture of $m=0$, axisymmetric sausage-modes,\nand $m=1, $ kink-modes, they were observing. Theoretical studies of the interaction of flux tubes and waves have been performed in the past, for example \\cite{Roberts79},  \\cite{Wilson80}, \\cite{Spruit81}, \\cite{Spruit82}, \\cite{Knolker89}, \\cite{Solanki93}, %\n\\cite{Bogdan96},\n\\cite{Hasan99}, \\cite{Tirry00}, \\cite{Gizon06}, \\cite{Jain08}, \\cite{Hanasoge08a},\n\\cite{Hanasoge09}.\nIt is now well established that slender magnetic flux tubes permit the\npropagation of the two basic types of magnetohydrodynamic waves: The\nlongitudinal tube waves (sausage modes) with azimuthal wave number $m$\n= 0, which are axisymmetric, excited by pressure fluctuations. The\ntransversal tube waves (kink modes) with $m$ =$\\pm$ 1, which are\nnon-axisymmetric and describe the incompressible undulations of the\ntube, supported by magnetic tension. However, in these various\npapers, simplifying assumptions were used, such as the thin-flux-tube\napproximation, isothermal or unstratified atmospheres, and the neglect\nof higher-$m$ modes. \n\\cite{Hanasoge08a}\nincluded a stratified atmosphere and used the thin-flux-tube approximation  to\nevaluate the scattering matrix associated with an $f$-mode wave\ninteracting with a flux tube. The thin-flux-tube approximation works\nwhen the radius of the tube is smaller than it scale height which was $260$ km. For this \nreason the largest tube that they considered was 160 km. Numerical treatment of flux tubes of \narbitrary size is straightforward and robust. The approach is already yielding interesting \nresults in the context of sunspots, see {\\it e.g.} \\cite{Cameron07}, \n\\cite{Hanasoge08},  \\cite{Khomenko08}, \\cite{Cameron08}, \\cite{Khomenko09}.\n\nIn this paper we use numerical simulations to explore the response of vertical, small scale\nflux-tubes with radii between 200 km and 3 Mm. The paper is structured as\nfollows: In Section 2 we  present the background model and the\nequations describing the wave propagation. In Section 3 we present the\nresults of a series of convergence tests. These are essential since we\nare considering tubes with small radii.

        "question": "What causes the discrepancy between oxygen abundances derived from O I and [O I] spectral lines in metal-poor halo stars?",
        "introduction": "Oxygen abundance determination in F--K stars is one of the most \ncontroversial and interesting topics in stellar spectroscopy,\nespecially concerning the behavior of the [O/Fe] ratio in metal-poor\nhalo stars (see, e.g., Carretta et al. 2000; King 2000; Israelian et al.\n2001; Nissen et al. 2002; and the references therein). \n\nNamely, we are faced with a problem currently in hot controversy \non the observational side, which stems from the fact that each of the \ndifferent groups of spectral lines, \n(a) high-excitation permitted O~{\\sc i} lines (e.g., 7773 triplet), \n(b) low-excitation forbidden [O~{\\sc i}] lines (6300/6363 lines), and \n(c) OH lines at UV ($\\sim$ 3100--3200 $\\rm\\AA$), \ndo not necessarily yield reasonably consistent oxygen abundances \nin metal-poor stars.\n\nMore precisely, a distinct discrepancy is occasionally reported between\nthe abundances derived from O~{\\sc i} and [O~{\\sc i}] lines in the sense that \nthe former tend to yield systematically higher oxygen abundances\nthan the latter in metal-poor stars (see, e.g., Cavallo et al. 1997),\nin contrast to the relation between O~{\\sc i} and OH lines which give\nmore or less consistent abundances (e.g., Boesgaard et al. 1999).\nAs a result, different trends of O-to-Fe ratio, an important tracer\nof early nucleosynthesis in our Galaxy, have naturally been suggested:\n(1) plateau-like [O/Fe] from [O~{\\sc i}] lines, and (2) ever-rising [O/Fe]\nfrom O~{\\sc i} or OH lines.\n\nAdmittedly, what has been described above is nothing but a rough summary\nand the actual situation is more complicated than such a simple\ndichotomic picture. \nFor example, the O~{\\sc i} vs. [O~{\\sc i}]\ndiscordance appears to be observed only in {\\it metal-poor} halo stars,\nsince such a systematic disagreement is absent in population I G--K giants\n(cf. Takeda et al. 1998).\nMoreover, according to Carretta et al.'s (2000) \nrecent investigation of very metal-poor stars (mainly giants), \na ``nearly flat'' [O/Fe] trend was concluded consistently\nfrom both of the O~{\\sc i} and [O~{\\sc i}] lines. \nVery recently, on the other hand, Nissen et al. (2002) also\nobtained nearly consistent O~{\\sc i} and [O~{\\sc i}] abundances\nof metal-poor dwarfs and subgiants, but at a ``quasi-linearly increasing''\ntrend in contrast to Carretta et al. (2000), \nthough an application of the 3D hydrodynamical model \natmospheres\\footnote{\nThis effect is another controversial factor of importance in the\noxygen abundance problem, and the results from the classical\n1D model atmospheres neglecting this effect \n(e.g., the temperature of the upper layer is considerably lowered\nin the 3D atmospheric model) may suffer appreciable corrections.\nThough theoretical investigations in this field are still in progress,\nthe nature of the 3D abundance corrections ($\\Delta_{\\rm 3D}\\log\\epsilon$)\nto be applied to the 1D\nsolutions for each oxygen line may be roughly summarized as follows\n(e.g., Kiselman \\& Nordlund 1995; Asplund 2001; Allende Prieto et al. 2001;\nAsplund \\&  Garc{\\'\\i}a Per{\\'e}z 2001; Nissen et al. 2002):\\\\\n--- This 3D effect is practically negligible for the deeply-forming\nhigh-excitation O~{\\sc i} lines (cf. Fig. 10 in Kiselman \\& Nordlund 1995;\nAsplund 2001).\\\\\n--- Similarly, its effect on the forbidden [O~{\\sc i}] line is generally\nminor ($|\\Delta_{\\rm 3D}\\log\\epsilon| \\la 0.1$ dex; the sign of \nthe correction is \nnegative), but may be increased to an appreciable amount up to $\\sim 0.2$ \ndex in lower gravity/metallicity atmospheres (cf. Table 6 in Nissen et al.\n2002).\\\\\n--- The 3D effect is most important on the UV OH lines, and conspicuously\nlarge corrections amounting to $|\\Delta_{\\rm 3D}\\log\\epsilon| \\sim 0.6$ dex \nor even more (at [Fe/H] = $-3.0$; $\\Delta_{\\rm 3D}\\log\\epsilon$ being negative)\nare suggested (cf. Table 2 in Asplund \\&  Garc{\\'\\i}a Per{\\'e}z 2001).\\\\\nSince our main concern in this paper is to investigate the non-LTE effect\non the abundances derived from the O~{\\sc i} and [O~{\\sc i}] lines, \nour use of the classical 1D models would not cause any serious problems\n(actually, taking account of the 3D correction does not essentially \naffect our final conclusion; cf. the footnote 11 in Sect. 4.5.1).\n} \n(taking into account the atmospheric granular motions)\ntends to deteriorates the agreement.\n\nThis confusion makes us wonder which on earth is the correct \nand reliable indicator of the oxygen abundance.\nGenerally speaking, a modest view currently preferred by many people is \nthat [O~{\\sc i}] lines are less problematic and more creditable due to\ntheir weak $T_{\\rm eff}$-sensitivity as well as the general belief\nof the validity for the assumption of LTE,\nwhile O~{\\sc i} and OH lines are less reliable because of the uncertainties\ninvolved with the non-LTE correction (O~{\\sc i}) or with the 3D effect of\natmospheric inhomogeneity (OH).\n\nRecently, however, we cast doubt on this conservative picture\nand suggested the possibility of erroneously underestimated\nabundances from [O~{\\sc i}] lines (i.e., the problem may be due to \nthe formation of forbidden lines rather than that of permitted lines)\nbased on our analysis of seven metal-poor stars \n(Takeda et al. 2000), which indicated the tendency of above-mentioned \nO~{\\sc i} vs. [O~{\\sc i}] discrepancy (though a small number of sample \nstars prevented us from making any convincing argument).\n\nMotivated by that work suggesting the necessity of \na follow-up study to check if our hypothesis is reasonable or not, \nwe decided to revisit this O~{\\sc i} vs. [O~{\\sc i}] problem while paying \nspecial attention to the topic of the non-LTE correction to be applied,\none of the controversial factors in oxygen abundance determination.\nToward this aim, we carried out new extensive non-LTE calculations,\nbased on which the numerous published equivalent-width data were \nreanalyzed to derive the non-LTE abundances, in order to discuss \nwhether or not the abundance discrepancy between O~{\\sc i} and [O~{\\sc i}] \nreally exists, which we hope to shed some light on the oxygen problem of \nmetal-deficient stars mentioned above.\n\nThis paper is organized as follows:\\\\\n--- First, extensive tables of non-LTE corrections for \nthe O~{\\sc i} 7771--5 triplet lines over a wide range of \natmospheric parameters are presented, so that they may be applied \nto late-F through early-K dwarfs/giants of various metallicities.\\\\\n--- Second, in order for application of such tables to actual analysis of\nobservational data, we try to find out a useful analytical\nformula for evaluating non-LTE corrections of these O~{\\sc i} triplet lines\nfor any given atmospheric parameters ($T_{\\rm eff}$, $\\log g$, $\\xi$)\nand an observed equivalent width ($W_{\\lambda}$).\\\\\n--- Third, we investigate the possibility of a non-LTE effect for the\nlow-excitation forbidden [O~{\\sc i}] 6300/6363 lines, for which few such\nattempt has ever been made.\\\\\n--- Fourth, equivalent-width data of O~{\\sc i} 7771--5 lines as well as\n[O~{\\sc i}] 6300/6363 lines taken from various literature are reanalyzed\nwithin the framework of the consistent system of analysis along with \napplication of our non-LTE correction formula, in order to discuss \nthe characteristics of [O/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation derived from \npermitted O~{\\sc i} lines and forbidden [O~{\\sc i}] lines separately.\n\nAlso, as a supplementary subject related to this study,\nthe influence of the treatment of H~{\\sc i} collision on the non-LTE\ncorrections of O~{\\sc i} 7771--5 lines was quantitatively estimated,\nand the consistency of the present choice of this parameter was checked\nby comparing the abundances of nearby solar-type stars derived from\nO~{\\sc i} 7771--5, O~{\\sc i} 6158, and [O~{\\sc i}] 6300 lines.\nIn addition, we also tried to qualitatively explain the line formation \nof O~{\\sc i} 7771--5 in terms of the simple classical two-level-atom model, \nwhich gives us an insight to understanding the behavior of \nthe non-LTE correction for these triplet lines.\nThese are separately described in Appendices A and B, respectively."

        "question": "What role does the formation and destruction of hydrogen molecules play in altering the cosmic recombination history during the epoch when the Universe was around 1000 times smaller than it is today?",
        "introduction": "The era of percent-level precision cosmology started with the exquisite measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies by the {\\slshape Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe} ({\\slshape WMAP}) satellite \\cite{2003ApJS..148....1B}. The CMB anisotropies are a very useful tool for cosmologists for two reasons. First, the shapes and normalizations of the temperature and polarization spectra are sensitive to a host of cosmological parameters \\cite{1996PhRvD..54.1332J}. Second, the physics underlying the CMB power spectrum is thought to be well understood.  It can be calculated by linear perturbation theory of the Einstein and Boltzmann equations around a homogeneous, isotropic background \\cite{1970ApJ...162..815P,1980PhRvD..22.1882B,1983ApJ...274..443B}; the perturbation equations can be solved rapidly by modern numerical codes that have achieved agreement at the 0.1\\%\\ level in code comparisons \\cite{2003PhRvD..68h3507S}.  However, to solve these equations one needs to know the number density of free electrons as a function of redshift $n_e(z)$, the so called recombination history, which enters into these equations through the Thompson scattering of photons from free electrons.\n\nThe first cosmological recombination calculations were carried out more than 40 years ago \\cite{1968ApJ...153....1P, 1968ZhETF..55..278Z}, showing the importance of non-equilibrium hydrogen recombination because of the high optical depth of the Lyman series lines in the early universe. A hydrogen atom can only reach its ground state from the H{\\sc\\,i} 2s level or 2p levels via two-photon decay and redshifting out of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line, respectively.  The early analyses assumed Boltzmann equilibrium of all $n\\ge 2$ levels of hydrogen, and thus had to follow only ionized hydrogen H$^++e^-$, excited hydrogen H$^\\ast(n\\ge2)$, and ground-state hydrogen H(1s).\n\nTo obtain $n_e(z)$ to high accuracy, it is necessary to include additional physics.  Thus theorists have considered helium recombination \\cite{1969PThPh..42..219M, 1971PThPh..46..416M, 1995PhRvD..52.5498H,2005AstL...31..359D, 2007MNRAS.378L..39K, 2008PhRvD..77h3006S, 2008PhRvD..77h3007H, 2008PhRvD..77h3008S, 2008A&A...485..377R, 2010MNRAS.402.1221C}; deviations from Boltzmann equilibrium for the $n\\ge 2$ levels of hydrogen \\cite{2007MNRAS.374.1310C, 2010PhRvD..81h3005G, 2010MNRAS.407..599C, 2010MNRAS.407..658D, 2010PhRvD..82f3521A}; a host of two-photon processes \\cite{2005AstL...31..359D, 2006A&A...446...39C, 2006AstL...32..795K, 2007MNRAS.375.1441W, 2008PhRvD..77h3007H, 2008A&A...480..629C, 2008PhRvD..78b3001H, 2010A&A...512A..53C}; the transport of photons near Lyman-$\\alpha$ due to multiple resonant scattering \\cite{1989ApJ...338..594K, 1990ApJ...353...21K, 1991Ap.....34..124G, 1994ApJ...427..603R, 2008AstL...34..439G, 2009A&A...496..619C, 2009PhRvD..80b3001H, 2009A&A...503..345C, 2010A&A...512A..53C}; and cross-talk among various lines and the photoionization continuum \\cite{2007A&A...475..109C, 2008PhRvD..77h3006S, 2010PhRvD..81h3004K}.\n\nThe workhorse recombination code {\\sc Recfast}, used for {\\slshape WMAP} parameter constraints, was a fitting function to such non-equilibrium calculations including all of the physical processes recognized as important in the year $\\sim$2000 \\cite{1999ApJ...523L...1S,2000ApJS..128..407S}, and there have been some subsequent updates \\cite{2008MNRAS.386.1023W}.  {\\sc Recfast} was sufficiently accurate for the observations of its time, however to fully take advantage of the power of the {\\slshape Planck} satellite data (launched 2009) it is important to find $n_e(z)$ to the sub-percent level \\cite{2006MNRAS.373..561L,2008MNRAS.386.1023W}. This realization triggered a flurry of papers considering a host of new phenomena that could affect the recombination history to the percent and sub-percent level, culminating in two new publicly available codes that properly treat the radiative transfer effects in hydrogen and helium recombination \\cite{2010arXiv1010.3631C, 2010arXiv1011.3758A}.\n\nThe current paper is a continuation of the same effort to reach the required level of accuracy.  We consider how the formation and destruction of hydrogen molecules (H$_2$) in the X$^1\\Sigma_g^+$, B$^1\\Sigma_u^+$ and C$^1\\Pi_u$ electronic states can change the recombination history.  The reason that H$_2$ might be able to change the recombination history is that the Lyman and Werner bands (X$^1\\Sigma_g^+$--B$^1\\Sigma_u^+$ and X$^1\\Sigma_g^+$--C$^1\\Pi_u$) are near the Lyman-$\\alpha$ energy ($h\\nu_{{\\rm Ly}\\alpha}=10.2\\,$eV).  Thus the excitation, de-excitation, photodissociation, and photoassociation of the H$_2$ molecule can shuffle photons between the red and the blue sides of the Lyman-$\\alpha$ line.  In an expanding Universe, a photon redder than Lyman-$\\alpha$ is likely to simply redshift and eventually become a part of the far-infrared background, whereas a photon bluer than Lyman-$\\alpha$ will redshift into the Lyman-$\\alpha$ frequency and excite a ground-state hydrogen atom (which at $z>900$ would have been likely to be photoionized).  At an order of magnitude level, one would expect this H$_2$-mediated redistribution to become possibly significant if the net optical depth in the Lyman and Werner bands $\\tau_{\\rm LW}$ were of order $10^{-3}$, which for the recombination-era density and Hubble rate, and total oscillator strengths of order unity, would require an abundance $x[{\\rm H}_2]\\equiv n({\\rm H}_2)/n_{\\rm H} \\sim 10^{-12}$.  Therefore we are interested in even tiny quantities of molecular hydrogen.  It is worth noting that some models of early Universe chemistry have found $x[$H$_2]\\gtrsim 10^{-12}$ \\cite{1998A&A...335..403G, 2008A&A...490..521S} during the recombination epoch with simplified (i.e. not level-resolved) reaction networks.\n\nThe calculation of the abundance of hydrogen molecules has already been considered by many authors {\\em but for a different cosmological goal}, that is to assess the effect of the H$_2$ molecule on the cooling of metal-free gas and its implications for primordial star formation \\cite{1967Natur.216..976S, 1968ApJ...154..891P,1969PThPh..41..835H, 1972PASJ...24...87Y, 1976ApJ...205..103H, 1984ApJ...280..465L, 1996ApJ...464..523H, 1996ApJ...467..522H, 1997ApJ...474....1T}.  Since direct radiative association to the X$^1\\Sigma_g^+$ electronic level, i.e. 2H$\\rightarrow$H$_2($X$^1\\Sigma_g^+)+\\gamma$ is forbidden, two separate hydrogen atoms must reach the ground state of H$_2$ through an intermediate route. For the case of the post-recombination era when $k_{\\rm B} T_{\\text{CMB}} < 0.2\\,$eV the accessible routes are through the H$_2^+$ \\cite{1967Natur.216..976S} and H$^-$ \\cite{1968ApJ...154..891P,1969PThPh..41..835H} intermediate states.  Indeed, complex reaction networks have been constructed to follow hydrogen chemistry \\cite{1984ApJ...280..465L, 1998A&A...335..403G, 1998ApJ...509....1S, 2000MNRAS.316..901F, 2002JPhB...35R..57L, 2006MNRAS.372.1175H}.  These have identified in particular the significance of the recombination-induced CMB spectral distortion \\cite{2006A&A...458L..29C, 2008A&A...485..377R, 2008A&A...488..861C} in controlling pregalactic photochemistry, the importance of rate coefficients \\cite{2006ApJ...640..553G, 2008MNRAS.388.1627G, 2009MNRAS.393..911G}, and the importance of following transitions among the various rotational and vibrational levels of the H$_2^+$ ion at $z<500$ \\cite{2006MNRAS.372.1175H}.\n\nHowever, at the redshift of interest for this paper, $z \\sim 1000$, there is another route for the formation of hydrogen molecules: the inverse Solomon process \\cite{2006ApJ...646L..91D}.  At this era there are enough ultraviolet photons (both blackbody photons and spectral distortion photons) to facilitate the photo-attachment of two hydrogen atoms into an excited H$_2$ molecule in one of the rovibrational levels of either the B$^1\\Sigma^+_u$ (Lyman band) or C$^1 \\Pi_u$ (Werner band) electronic states with energies $\\sim 10\\,$eV.  The excited H$_2$ molecule will re-emit the photon and decay to either a bound H$_2$(X$^1\\Sigma_g^+$) molecule, or to the continuum of the X level (i.e. to two H atoms).  In equation form,\n\\begin{equation}\n2{\\rm H} + \\gamma \\leftrightarrow {\\rm H}_2({\\rm B}^1\\Sigma_u^+,{\\rm C}^1\\Pi_u) \\leftrightarrow {\\rm H}_2({\\rm X}^1\\Sigma_g^+) + \\gamma.\n\\label{eq:H2process}\n\\end{equation}\nThis mechanism and the charged-particle processes (H$^-$, H$_2^+$, and HeH$^+$) control the H$_2$ abundance at high redshift.  The possible effect on hydrogen atom recombination is the main focus of this paper.  We note that Ref.~\\cite{2006ApJ...646L..91D} found only a small production of H$_2$ via this mechanism, but they did not include the spectral distortion photons in their rate coefficient and hence the {\\em total} rate of H$_2$ production could be many orders of magnitude larger.  Of course, the same spectral distortion also drives H$_2$ photodissociation -- the left arrows in Eq.~(\\ref{eq:H2process}) -- so the net effect on the H$_2$ abundance requires a detailed calculation.  Deviations from thermal equilibrium abundances arise not from the amplitude of the ultraviolet photon spectrum, but the way in which its peculiar shape beats against the forest of H$_2$ lines and dissociation continua.  Since we work at $z>800$ we will not distinguish the matter versus radiation temperature in this paper.\n \nThis paper is organized as follows: in Sec.~\\ref{sec:AC} we write down the rate equations for the bound-bound and bound-free transitions. These equations are then solved in the steady state approximation and the results are presented in Sec.~\\ref{sec:R}. We discuss the size of the H$_2$ abundances found in the previous chapter on the absorption of Ly-$\\alpha$ photons and conclude in Sec.~\\ref{sec:DandC}."

        "question": "What is the typical magnitude range for faint Cataclysmic Variable stars that can be studied with 1-2 meter class telescopes using CCD photometry?",
        "introduction": "The first paper in this series (Woudt \\& Warner 2001, Paper I) explained the philosophy\ndriving our survey of faint Cataclysmic Variable stars (CVs). In essence, the combinations of basic\nparameters (masses, mass transfer rates, periods, magnetic fields) and viewing angles (orbital inclination) result\nin no two CVs appearing alike. Furthermore, there has been a steady increase in revealed new phenomena as\nlarger numbers of CVs have been studied in detail. Also, the advent of 8-m class telescopes opens opportunities for\nhigh resolution studies of much fainter CVs than hitherto, so a preliminary examination of such stars down to\nmagnitudes 20 or 21 is now justified in order to discover the more interesting specimens.\n\nThe observations reported here were in almost all cases made with the University of Cape Town (UCT) CCD \nphotometer (O'Donoghue 1995) attached to the 1.0-m (40-in) or 1.9-m (74-in) reflectors at the Sutherland site \nof the South African Astronomical Observatory. As in Paper I, the full wavelength response of the CCD was used, i.e.\nwe observed in white light. Our photometry was calibrated by observing hot white dwarf standards.\nWe have tended to concentrate on faint nova remnants in crowded fields, this having proved a rewarding area\nfor the discovery of objects of particular interest, and one where the UCT CCD photometer reveals its greatest\nadvantages.\n\nThe observations are given in Section 2 and some brief conclusions in Section 3.

        "question": "What are the four proposed formation mechanisms for thick disks in galaxies?",
        "introduction": "Thick disks in lenticular and spiral galaxies are defined as disk-like components with a scaleheight larger than that of the thin or `canonical' disk. They are typically detected as exponential excesses of light a few thin disk scaleheights above the galaxy mid-plane in edge-on galaxies. They have been first detected by Tsikoudi (1979) and recognized as a distinct galaxy structural component by Burstein (1979). A thick disk component was soon found in the Milky Way (Gilmore \\& Reid 1983) and it was afterwards proved to be made of old and metal-poor stars when compared to the thin disk stellar population (Reid \\& Majewski 1993; Chiba \\& Beers 2000). Later studies found thick disks to be nearly ubiquitous (Yoachim \\& Dalcanton 2006; Comer\\'on et al.~2011a) and to be systematically older than their thin counterparts (Yoachim \\& Dalcanton 2008a).\n\nThe origin of thick disks is still a matter of debate, with four formation mechanisms being discussed (see the introduction of Yoachim \\& Dalcanton 2008a and references therein). The first two possibilities consider two different mechanisms to dynamically heat an originally thin disk, meaning that its vertical stellar velocity dispersion is increased. In the first possibility this dynamical heating could be a consequence of internal evolution due to gravitational interaction with thin disk overdensities like giant molecular clouds or spiral arms (Villumsen 1985; H\\\"anninen \\& Flynn 2002; Sch\\\"onrich \\& Binney 2009; Bournaud et al.~2009). In the second the heating is considered to be due to galaxy-galaxy or dark matter subhalo-galaxy interactions and mergers (Quinn et al.~1993;  Robin et al.~1996; Walker et al.~1996; Vel\\'azquez \\& White 1999; Chen et al.~2001; Benson et al.~2004; Hayashi \\& Chiba 2006; Kazantzidis et al.~2008; Read et al.~2008; Villalobos \\& Helmi 2008; Qu et al.~2011). The third possibility is that the thick disk is a consequence of {\\it in situ} star formation (Brook et al.~2004; Robertson et al.~2006; Elmegreen \\& Elmegreen 2006; Brook et al.~2007; Richard et al.~2010) or star formation with a high initial velocity dispersion in very massive star clusters (Kroupa 2002). Possibilities one and three are related if thick disk star formation occurs in gas that has a high turbulent velocity dispersion from its own clump stirring. The fourth possibility is that the thick disk is formed by accretion of stars from disrupted small satellite galaxies after the initial build-up of the galaxy (Statler 1988; Gilmore et al.~2002; Abadi et al.~2003; Navarro et al.~2004; Martin et al.~2004; Read et al.~2008).\n\nAnother topic of debate is that of ``missing'' or ``lost''  baryons (Persic \\& Salucci 1992). The fraction of baryons detected at high redshift (see, e.g., WMAP predictions by Spergel et al.~2003), does apparently not match the present-day fraction of baryons. Part of the missing baryons are expected to be found in  hot gas in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM; see, e.g., Fukugita et al.~1998, simulations from Cen \\& Ostriker and WHIM emission detection/constraining by Hickox \\& Markevitch 2007 and Zappacosta et al.~2010). Additionally, dark matter haloes in which galaxies lie are also found to be very baryon deficient compared to the cosmic baryon fraction (McGaugh 2008). This apparent lack of baryons inside the galaxy potential well is what has been called the ``local missing baryon'' problem. Part of these baryons have probably escaped due to winds caused by supernova feedback, but the local baryon budget is far from being accounted for (McGaugh 2008 and references therein).\n\n\\begin{figure}[t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{c}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.45\\textwidth]{simpleNGC4565.eps}\n\\end{tabular}\n\\caption{\\label{simpleNGC4565} Reproduction of Figure 12 in van der Kruit \\& Searle (1981) using S$^4$G data.

The data of the four quadrants have been averaged in order to produce the plot.}\n\\end{center}\n\\end{figure}\n\nIn this Paper we make use of {\\it Spitzer} Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G; Sheth et al.~2010) mid-IR imaging of edge-on disk galaxies to assess their stellar vertical mass distribution. The main observational goal of S$^{4}$G is obtaining IRAC (Fazio et al.~2004) $3.6\\mu {\\rm m}$ and $4.5\\mu {\\rm m}$-band images for 2331 galaxies with a radial velocity $V_{\\rm radio}<3000\\,{\\rm km\\,s^{-1}}$. These passbands are not strongly affected by dust (Draine \\& Lee 1984; Sheth et al.~2010) and are not as sensitive to star-forming regions as optical wavelengths, making them especially well suited for tracing the underlying stellar population of galaxies. In addition, having a typical surface brightness sensitivity of $\\mu_{\\rm AB}\\sim27\\,{\\rm mag\\,arcsec}^{-2}$ in the $3.6\\mu{\\rm m}$ band the S$^{4}$G images have an unprecedented depth for such a large number of galaxies. This high sensitivity allows us to reproduce luminosity profiles down to $\\mu_{\\rm AB}\\sim26\\,{\\rm mag\\,arcsec}^{-2}$ at $3.6\\mu{\\rm m}$ (Figure~\\ref{simpleNGC4565}) with a much better spatial resolution than presented in previous papers (e.g., Burstein 1979; van der Kruit \\& Searle 1981). In order to study these edge-on galaxies, we made fits of vertical luminosity profiles in the $3.6\\mu {\\rm m}$ band. The fitted function results from coupling two luminous (stellar) isothermal disks in equilibrium. We also considered a third component made of cold gas in some cases. We tested the effect that the inclusion of a dark matter halo would have in our fits and found it to cause biases smaller than the error introduced by choosing the mass-to-light ratios of the thin and thick disk. In addition, we tested the effect of fitting the luminosity profiles of non perfectly edge-on galaxies and found it to introduce a small bias which goes opposite to that introduced by a dark matter halo.\n\nThis Paper is structured as follows. We present the selected sample in Section~2. In Section~3 we describe the luminosity profile fitting we adopted and describe its potential caveats. The results of our fits are presented in Section~4 and are discussed in Section~5. The conclusions and a brief summary of the Paper are presented in Section~6."

        "question": "What is the typical duration of the obscured phase in the lifetime of an active galactic nucleus?",
        "introduction": "A major recent development in extragalactic astronomy is the discovery\nthat a large fraction of the spheroids in the local Universe contain a\nsuper-massive black hole \\citep[e.g.][]{Magorrian1998} and that the\nmass of this monster is tightly correlated to the stellar mass of host\ngalaxy bulge \\citep[e.g.][]{Ferrarese2000,Gebhardt2000}. The\nimplication of this fundamental observation is that the formation and\nevolution of galaxies and the build-up of super-massive BHs at their\ncenters are interconnected. The evidence above has prompted attempts\nto model the interplay between black-hole growth and star-formation\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Fabian1998}. A recent development in this direction are\nsimulations which include AGN feedback mechanisms\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Hopkins2005}. In these, galaxy mergers trigger the AGN\nand also produce nuclear starbursts that both feed and obscure the\ncentral engine for most of its active lifetime\n($\\approx 10^{8}$\\,yr). AGN-driven outflows also develop,\nwhich at later stages become strong enough to rapidly quench the\nstar-formation, leaving behind a red passive remnant and allowing the\nAGN to shine unobscured for a short period\n($\\approx 10^{7}$\\,yr). The attractiveness of this class\nof models is that they reproduce a number of AGN properties (e.g.\nduty-cycle, $N_{\\mathrm{H}}$ distribution, luminosity function), while\nthey can potentially explain galaxy properties, such as the bimodality\nof the colour magnitude diagram\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Bell2004,Willmer2006,Nandra2006}, via the AGN-driven\nregulation of the star-formation.\n\nThe predictions of the AGN feedback model above include a link between\nthe obscured AGN stage and starburst events. In the local Universe\n$(z<0.1)$ an association between {\\it optically} selected AGN and\nrecent/ongoing star-formation has been established using the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey \\citep[SDSS;][]{Kauffmann2003}. The link between\nobscured accreting BHs and star-formation remains controversial\nhowever, despite claims that Seyfert-IIs show optical spectroscopic\nevidence for young stellar populations\n\\citep[e.g.][]{CidFernandes2001}. The low-$z$ results above, although\nbroadly consistent with the merger formation models of\n\\citet{Hopkins2005}, are based on optically selected AGN samples,\nwhich may miss a substantial fraction of the BH accretion in the\nUniverse \\citep[e.g.][]{Mushotzky2004}. At higher redshift in\nparticular ($z\\approx 1$), close to peak of the global AGN density\n\\citep*[e.g.][]{Barger2005,Hasinger2005}, X-ray observations are\narguably the most efficient tool for identifying AGN over a wide range\nof luminosities and obscurations. The stellar population of the X-ray\nselected AGN in deep surveys is still under\ndebate. \\citet{Franceschini2005} find that about 40\\% of the X-ray\nsources in the ELAIS-N1 SWIRE region have mid-IR SEDs consistent with\nongoing star-formation. Contamination of these wavelengths from hot\ndust emission related to the central accreting BH remains an issue\nhowever, when interpreting the mid-IR properties of X-ray\nsources. Recently, \\citet{Nandra2006} find that the majority of the\n$z\\approx 1$ X-ray sources in the AEGIS survey \\citep{Davis2006} have\nrest-frame colours of passive red galaxies indicating a dominant old\nstellar population with little, if any, current star-formation.\n\nOne of the difficulties in studying the stellar content of AGN hosts\nis the decomposition of the stellar light from the emission of the\naccreting BH. Combining information from different parts of the\nelectromagnetic spectrum is essential to address this issue. In this\npaper we follow such a multiwavelength approach to study the nature of\nthe $\\mu$Jy radio emission of X-ray sources in the Extended Chandra\nDeep Field South (E-CDFS) and to explore the implications in the\ncontext of the AGN/star-formation connection. This is motivated by\nprevious claims that X-ray selected type-II (X-ray absorbed) AGN\nare more frequently associated with $\\mu$Jy flux density radio sources\n\\citep{Bauer2002,Georgakakis2004}. At these faint limits the radio\npopulation is dominated by starbursts\n\\citep{Georgakakis1999,Chapman2003,Afonso2005} and therefore,\nthe above finding has been tentatively interpreted as evidence for a\nlink between star-formation and obscured AGN. The radio luminosities\nof these systems ($\\approx 10^{23}$\\,W\\,Hz$^{-1}$) are well below\nthose of the classic radio galaxies ($>10^{24}$\\,W\\,Hz$^{-1}$),\nsuggesting that star-formation may contribute or even dominate the\nobserved radio emission.\n \nIn addition to the deep X-ray observations in the E-CDFS the\nmultiwavelnegth data used here include ultra-deep wide-area radio\n1.4\\,GHz observations (60\\,$\\mu$Jy; 0.3\\,deg$^{2}$;\n\\citealt{Afonso2006}), Spitzer mid-IR photometry as part of the Great\nObservatories Origins Deep Survey (GOODS) as well as extensive optical\nphotometric and spectroscopic follow-up programs. These complementary\nmultiwavelength observations are essential to explore the nature of\nthe $\\mu$Jy radio emission in X-ray selected AGN. Throughout this\npaper we adopt $\\mathrm{H_{0}=72\\,km\\,s^{-1}\\,Mpc^{-1}}$,\n$\\Omega_{\\mathrm{M}}=0.3$ and $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$."

        "introduction": "BL Lac objects are a special subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) \n showing some extreme properties: rapid and large variability, high and \n variable polarization, no or only weak emission lines in its classical \n definition.\n\n BL Lac objects are variable not only in the optical band, but also in radio, \n infrared,  X-ray,  and even $\\gamma$-ray bands. Some BL Lac objects show that\n the spectral index changes with the brightness of the source (Bertaud et \n al. 1973; Brown et al. 1989; Fan 1993), generally, the spectrum flattens when \n the source brightens, but different phenomenon has also been found (Fan et\n al. 1999).\n\n The nature of AGNs is still an open problem; the study of AGNs variability \n can  yield valuable information about their nature, and the implications for \n quasars modeling are extremely important ( see Fan et al. 1998a).\n\n PKS 2155-304, the prototype of the X-ray selected BL Lac objects and\n TeV $\\gamma$-ray emitter (Chadwick et al. 1999), is one \n of the  brightest and the best studied objects. Its spectrum from \n $\\lambda 3600$ to $\\lambda6800$ appears blue (B-V$<$0.1) and featureless \n (Wade et al. 1979). A 0.17 redshift  was claimed from the probably detected\n  weak [O III] emission  feature ( Charles et al.  1979), which was not \n detected in  Miller \\& McAlister (1983) observation.  Later, a redshift of \n 0.117 was  obtained from  several discrete absorption features (Bowyer \n et al. 1984).   PKS 2155-304 varies at  all observation  frequencies and \n is one of the most extensively studied  objects for both space-based  \n observations in UV and X-ray bands (Treves et al.  1989; Urry et al. 1993;  \n Pian et al. 1996; Giommi et al. 1998) and multiwavelength observations \n (Pesce et al. 1997 ). Variation over a time scale of one day was observed\n (Miller \\& Carini 1991) and that over a time scale of as short as 15 minutes\n is also reported by Paltani et al.

Thus well-studied aspherical features of observed core-collapse supernovae -- such as the high-velocity ``jets'' of sulfur-rich material seen in the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A \\cite{2013ApJ...772..134M}, the double-peaked structure of the Oxygen and Magnesium nebular lines in observations of SN 2003jd \\cite{2005Sci...308.1284M}, the two light curve components of SN 2013ge \\cite{2016ApJ...821...57D}, and the spectropolarimetric observations of stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae \\cite{2012ApJ...754...63T} -- are apparently generated during the earliest moments of the explosion. \n\nThe violent fluid motions in the core of the star naturally lead to turbulence and the role of the turbulence in the dynamics of the explosion has become a topic of recent interest \\cite{2011ApJ...742...74M,2012ApJ...749..142F,2013ApJ...765..110D,2013PhST..155a4022E,2014ApJ...783..125H,2015ApJ...808...70A,2015ApJ...799....5C,2015ApJ...808...70A,2016ApJ...820...76R}. At present, core-collapse supernova simulations are beginning to reach sufficient spatial resolution to see the inertial range of the turbulence \\cite{2016ApJ...820...76R}, which will allow simulators to better answer questions such as the effect of the `turbulence bottleneck' -- the accumulation of power in the inertial scales of the turbulence \\cite{1994PhFl....6.1411F,2003PhRvE..68b6304D,2015PhRvE..92c3009K,2015ApJ...808...70A} -- and the difference between turbulence in 2D and 3D. However, the presence of turbulence in the simulations also raises new questions, especially regarding the neutrinos which play a crucial role in the explosion. Several studies have shown that turbulence during the \\emph{cooling} phase of the explosion changes the neutrino flavor evolution  \\cite{Sawyer:1990PhRvD..42.3908S,Loreti:1995ae,1996PhRvD..54.3941B,Friedland:2006ta,Fogli:2006JCAP...06..012F,Choubey:2007PhRvD..76g3013C,2010PhRvD..82l3004K,2013PhRvD..88d5020K,2013PhRvD..88b5004K,2013PhRvD..88b3008L,2015PhRvD..92a3009K}. Given this result, one might also expect turbulence during the \\emph{accretion} phase to also have an effect upon the neutrino flavor evolution. Any change in the flavor evolution will alter the neutrino spectra which would then alter the amount of neutrino heating. Since neutrino heating is a source of the fluid motion which leads to turbulence, any effect of turbulence upon the neutrinos feeds back to the turbulence itself. \n\nA previous study by Reid, Adams, \\& Seunarine considered the effect of accretion phase turbulence but found no effect upon the neutrino flavor evolution \\cite{2011PhRvD..84h5023R}. However, this study was purely numerical and introduced a large number of parameters (e.g., the density profile for the supernova, the turbulence power spectrum). Scanning the full multi-dimensional parameter space is the only way to conclusively determine if some combination of parameters might produce flavor evolution. This is not feasible, particularly given the large dynamic range inherent in numerical calculations of the effect of turbulence upon neutrino evolution, which makes these calculations extremely time-consuming. Perhaps surprisingly, the effect of turbulence upon neutrino flavor evolution is actually amenable to theory even on a case-by-case basis \\cite{Kneller:2012id,Patton:2013dba,Patton:2014lza}. Armed with analytical tools, one can more efficiently explore the parameter space and can make confident statements about the effect of turbulence upon the neutrinos, despite the many uncertainties that still exist. The goal of this paper is to use the analytical tools describing the effect of turbulence upon neutrino flavor evolution to explore why no effect of turbulence was  seen in the study by Reid, Adams \\& Seunarine \\cite{2011PhRvD..84h5023R} and whether there is any corner of the parameter space where it might occur. \n\nOur paper is organized as follows. In Section \\S\\ref{sec:neutrinopropagation} we present the general description for neutrino propagation through matter, describe how we model the turbulence during the accretion phase, and then demonstrate using numerical calculations that no significant effect of turbulence occurs for the neutrinos using a set of representative density profiles. We then examine the problem using analytic models of the effect of turbulence on neutrino flavor evolution; namely, the Stimulated Transition and Distorted Phase Effect models. In Section \\S\\ref{sec:thescales} we show the Stimulated Transition model depends upon six different lengthscales and argue that three criteria must be satisfied if turbulence is to have an effect via this mechanism. When we assess whether these criteria are met in the numerical examples presented in Section \\S\\ref{sec:neutrinopropagation}, we see that they fail by many orders of magnitude. Section \\S\\ref{sec:distortedphase} considers whether turbulence effects should be expected via the Distorted Phase Effect, which depends upon the presence of multiple discontinuities or semi-adiabatic MSW resonances. When we search the profiles used in the numerical examples we find there are none. We then make our conclusions in Section \\S\\ref{sec:Conclusions}, discuss the limitations of our study, and determine whether one should ever expect turbulence effects upon the neutrinos during the accretion phase of core-collapse supernovae."

        "introduction": "Power-law cosmology finds a reasonable place in the literature to\naddress some common problems (e.g., age problem, flatness problem, horizon problem etc.) associated with the Standard Cold Dark Matter (SCDM) model based on Big Bang theory. In such a cosmology, the cosmological evolution is described\nby the scale factor $a(t)\\propto t^\\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a\nconstant. The viability of the model with $\\alpha\\geq1$ has been\nexplored in a series of articles in different contexts\n(Lohiya \\& Sethi 1999; Batra et al. 1999, 2000; Gehlaut et al. 2002, 2003; Dev et al. 2002, 2008; Sethi et al. 2005a, 2005b; Zhu et al. 2008). Observational constraints on phantom\npower-law cosmology are discussed by Kaeonikhom, Gumjudpai \\& Saridakis (2011). The\nmotivation for such an endeavor is followed by a number of\nconsiderations. For instance, power-law cosmological models with\n$\\alpha\\geq1$ do not encounter the horizon problem at all (Sethi, Dev \\& Jain 2005). These models do not witness the flatness\nproblem since the matter density is not constrained by the scale\nfactor. In these models, age of the Universe turns out at least\nfifty percent greater than the age predicted by the SCDM\nmodel. This bridges\nthe gap between the age of the Universe and the age estimates of\nglobular clusters and high-z redshift galaxies, and thus the age\nproblem is alleviated. Sethi, Dev \\& Jain (2005)  showed\nthat an open linear coasting cosmological model constrained with\ntype Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) \u201cgold\u201d sample and ages of old\nquasars accommodates a very old high-redshift quasar, which the\nSCDM model fails to do. The linear coasting cosmology\nis found to be consistent with the gravitational lensing statistics\n(Dev et al. 2002) and the primordial nucleosynthesis\n(Batra et al. 1999, 2000). Kaplinghat et al. (1999) found that the power-law cosmological models which succeed in primordial nucleosythesis are in conflict with the constraints from Hubble expansion rates and SNe Ia magnitude redshift relations.\n\nIn any cosmological model, the Hubble constant $H_{0}$ and\ndeceleration parameter $q$ play an important role is describing the\nnature of evolution of the Universe. The former one tells us the\nexpansion rate of the Universe today while the latter one\ncharacterizes the accelerating ($q<0$) or decelerating ($q>0$)\nnature of the Universe. In the recent past, there have been numerous\nattempts to estimate the value of $H_{0}$. Freedman et al. (2001) used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of\nCepheid variable to estimate a value of $H_{0}=72 \\pm 8$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. An observational determination of the Hubble constant obtained by\nSuyu et al. (2010) based upon measurements of gravitational lensing\nby using the HST yielded a value of $H_{0}= 69.7_{-5.0}^{+4.9}$\nkm s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. WMAP seven-year results gave an estimate of $H_{0}=\n71.0\\pm 2.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ based on WMAP data alone, and an estimate of\n$H_{0} = 70.4_{-1.4}^{+1.3}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ based on WMAP data with\nGaussian priors corresponding to earlier estimates from other\nstudies (Jarosik et al. 2011). A recent estimate of the Hubble constant,\nwhich used a new infrared camera on the HST to measure the distance\nand redshift for a collection of astronomical objects, gives a value\nof $H_{0} = 73.8 \\pm 2.4$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Riess et al. 2011). An alternative\nprobe using data from galactic clusters gave a value of $H_{0}= 67.0\n\\pm 3.2$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (Beutler et al. 2011).\n\n\nIn this paper, we show that the power-law cosmology essentially\ndepends on the parameters $q$ and $H_{0}$. We intend to find the\nobservational constraints on the power-law cosmology parameters\nusing the recent observational data from $H(z)$ and supernova\nobservations.

        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\n\nWeak gravitational lensing, the subtle distortion of galaxy images by large scale structure along the line of sight,\nis a potentially powerful cosmological probe and has been identified as one of the key\nfuture probes of dark energy \\cite{detf} (see, e.g.,\n\\cite{bartschnei01,hoekjain08,obsdereview12} for reviews).\nPromising results have already been obtained with existing data,\nsee for instance \\cite{Massetal07,Masseyetal07,Fuetal08,Schrabbetal09,huffetal11,kilbingeretal12,heymansetal13}.\nOngoing and upcoming surveys, such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES, \\cite{des}),\nthe Subaru Hyper Suprime Cam lensing survey (HSC, \\cite{hsc}), LSST \\cite{lsst} and EUCLID \\cite{euclid}, are expected\nto deliver shear measurements with sky coverage of more than an order of magnitude larger\nthan what is currently available and thus have the potential to strongly improve\nconstraints on dark energy and other cosmological parameters from weak lensing.\n\nHowever, before the full potential of these upcoming data can be reached,\nthere are a number of serious challenges that need to be addressed, such\nas correcting for the effect of the PSF on galaxy images and\nreaching galaxy shape measurements with $< 10^{-3}$ level precision,\nmodeling non-linear and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum,\nand understanding the contribution to the cosmic shear signal from\nintrinsic alignments.\n\nAnother main challenge comes from the requirement that the redshift distribution\nof lensing source galaxies be known to high precision.\nIt is this question that motivates the research presented in this paper.\nSince the depth and large number density of typical lensing source galaxy samples\npreclude the possibility\nof obtaining spectroscopic redshifts for all galaxies,\nthe standard approach is to employ broadband photometry,\nusing the measured flux through a number of bands to estimate redshifts.\nThese photometric redshifts (photo-$z$'s) can also be used to divide the sample into tomographic bins,\nwhich allows the extraction of information on redshift evolution of the background cosmology and of large scale structure.\n\n\nThe photo-$z$ estimator can be characterized\nby the distribution of estimated redshifts $z_{\\rm ph}$, given an object's true redshift $z$,\n$p(z_{\\rm ph}|z)$.\nSince photometric redshifts are essentially based on very low resolution spectra,\nthey tend to have large uncertainties ($\\sigma_z \\sim 0.03 - 0.1$). While this large width of the photo-$z$\ndistribution is not a big problem\nfor weak lensing studies (the lensing kernel is very broad anyway), the shape of the distribution needs to be known\nto high precision to avoid biasing cosmological parameter estimates.\nFor example, \\cite{mahuhut06} (see also \\cite{hut02,hutetal04,hutetal06}) have shown that both the width and the bias of this distribution\nneed to be known to better than about $0.003 - 0.01$ (depending on the dark energy model\nconsidered) for future surveys.\n\nIn order to characterize the photo-$z$ distribution, spectroscopic redshifts are required for a large, representative subsample of\ngalaxies\\footnote{Alternatively, a large spectroscopic sample could even\nbe used to directly characterize the source redshift distribution without using photo-$z$'s.\nHowever, there would be no way to do tomography in that approach.}\n(in addition, depending on the photo-$z$ method used,\nspectroscopic redshifts are needed to ``train'' the photo-$z$ estimator).\nFor upcoming surveys, this would require samples of $\\sim 10^5$ faint ($i \\sim 22 - 26$) spectroscopic galaxies\nwith large redshift success rates and few redshift failures (e.g.~\\cite{cunhaetal12}).\nFor many upcoming weak lensing surveys,\nit is not at all clear if appropriate spectroscopic samples will be available.\n\nA complementary/alternative method that can be used either to directly estimate the redshift distribution\nof a (source) galaxy sample, or to calibrate the photo-$z$ distribution,\nwas proposed in \\cite{newman08}.\nIn this  method, angular cross-correlations between the number density of source galaxies\nand the number density of an overlapping sample of spectroscopic galaxies in various redshift bins\nare used to deduce the average source galaxy number density in these bins\\footnote{This is but one of the ways in which\ncomplementarity between (overlapping) imaging and spectroscopic surveys can be exploited. For example,\n\\cite{caibern12,gaztaetal12} studied the expected gains from using the full cosmological information encoded in both\nthe weak lensing and galaxy clustering signal.}.\nThe spectroscopic galaxies are only required to cover the same volume (or a subvolume) as the source galaxies so that\nthey trace the same matter density modes and are {\\it not} required to be drawn from the same sample\nas the source galaxies.\n\nWhile the focus of this article is the application to weak lensing source samples, the cross-correlation method can be applied\nmore generally to any sample for which the redshift distribution is desired.\nThe expected performance of the cross-correlation method has been studied in detail in previous works\n\\cite{newman08,mathnewman10,schulz10,mattnewman12,mcwhite13}\n(see also \\cite{schneideretal06,bernhut10})\nand interesting results have been obtained on how the success of the method depends on survey properties,\nand on what are the main potential obstacles. While conclusions vary somewhat between works depending on the focus,\nthe cross-correlation technique looks promising based on these studies.\nThe approach has also been applied to existing data with some success \\cite{phillipps85,masjedietal06,hoetal08,menardetal13}.\n\nThe goal of this paper is to quantify to what extent measurements of the lensing source distribution via\nthe cross-correlation method improve the expected cosmological constraints from cosmic shear data.\nIn other words, we wish to know to what degree the cross-correlation method mitigates the loss of information\nin a cosmic shear analysis due to uncertainty in the source distribution. This question has only indirectly been studied\nin previous work. Typically, the accuracy of redshift distribution reconstruction is ascertained,\ntranslated to an uncertainty on the average redshift and the redshift scatter/width of a sample,\nand then compared to requirements on these quantities from weak lensing forecasts available elsewhere in the literature (e.g.~\\cite{mahuhut06}).\nWhile these previous studies show that the cross-correlation method is promising, a more quantitative study\nwould provide more insight. In this paper, we therefore present an integrated analysis of\nthe use of the cross-correlation technique in conjunction with a forecast of cosmology constraints from cosmic shear,\nexplicitly showing how dark energy (and other) constraints from cosmic shear are affected by the information\non the lensing source redshift distribution obtained from the cross-correlations.\n\nWe will consider two examples of upcoming combinations of overlapping lensing and redshift surveys:\n(1) SuMIRe, the combination of the HSC lensing survey and the PFS spectroscopic galaxy survey \\cite{pfsreport12},\nand (2) EUCLID, which will carry out both types of surveys.\nWe will use the Fisher matrix formalism to forecast parameter constraints, with a focus on the dark energy equation of state.\nThe resulting uncertainties approximately correspond to the uncertainties expected to be obtained from a maximum likelihood estimator\nor optimal quadratic estimator (\\cite{mcwhite13}).\n\n\n\nOne of the main potential problems with the cross-correlation method is that\nthe effect of the source redshift distribution on the observed angular cross-correlations\nis degenerate with redshift evolution of the source galaxy bias\n(see also \\cite{schulz10,bernhut10,mathnewman10,mcwhite13}).\nThis means that the strength of the cross-correlation technique\ncrucially depends on the (prior) knowledge of this bias evolution.\nWe will in this work go significantly beyond previous studies of this issue\nby allowing for an arbitrary redshift dependence of the galaxy bias (defined in narrow redshift slices)\nand studying how the source redshift distribution reconstruction and cosmological constraints\ndepend on the priors places on the bias evolution.\n\nWe consider two scenarios for the application of the cross-correlation method, roughly dividing the paper\ninto two parts.\nIn the first part of the paper (Sections \\ref{sec:shear th} - \\ref{sec:cc results}),\nwe will study the use of the cross-correlation technique in combination\nwith photometric redshift information.\nThis analysis follows the more or less standard method in the literature,\nwhere the source distribution in tomographic bins is determined by the shape\nof $p(z_{\\rm ph}|z)$, taken for simplicity to be a Gaussian.\nThe information from cross-correlations between the source galaxy number density and spectroscopic galaxies\nthen comes in as a way to measure the parameters (the bias and width specified at different redshift) defining $p(z_{\\rm ph}|z)$.\nQuestions of particular interest we will address, in addition to that of the degeneracy with bias evolution,\nare the dependence on the smallest scale used ($\\sim k_{\\rm max}^{-1}$) in the cross-correlation analysis,\nand the dependence on how well the photo-$z$ distribution was calibrated (e.g.~by using a deep spectroscopic galaxy sample)\nbefore the information from cross-correlations is employed.\n\nThe outline of this first part of the paper is as follows.\nIn Section \\ref{sec:shear th}, we review the relevant expressions\ndescribing the cosmic shear signal and the roles of the source redshift distribution\nand the photo-$z$ parameters.\nIn Section \\ref{sec:wlsurvey},\nwe briefly describe the assumed survey specifications\nfor the HSC and EUCLID lensing surveys.\nWe then forecast cosmological constraints from these surveys (including a CMB prior)\nin Section \\ref{sec:results wl}, and highlight the dependence on the assumed knowledge of the source\ndistribution.\nNext, in Section \\ref{sec:cc th}, we review the formalism of the cross-correlation technique\nand describe our galaxy bias priors,\nwhile in Section \\ref{sec:spec surveys} we describe the PFS and EUCLID\nspectroscopic surveys. The main results of the first part of the paper are then presented\nin Section \\ref{sec:cc results}, where we consider dark energy (and other) constraints\nwhen combining the information on the source redshift distribution from the cross-correlations\nwith the cosmological information encoded in the weak lensing power spectra.\n\nIn the (much shorter) second part of the paper, Section \\ref{direct}, we consider a different approach\nand study the case of an unknown source distribution without photo-$z$ information.\nOn the one hand, we will quantify how well such a distribution can be measured in narrow redshift bins directly\nfrom the cross-correlations with the spectroscopic sample (this is also what has been done in previous works).\nOn the other hand, we will ask which components of the source redshift distribution need to be known, and how well,\nin order for cosmic shear constraints not to be impacted. We then compare these two results to gain more insight into\nhow the cross-correlation method improves cosmological constraints from weak lensing\nand therefore into the results of the prior sections.\n\nWe end the article with a Discussion and Conclusions in Section \\ref{sec:disc}."

        "question": "What is the relationship between a galaxy's local environment and its primary mode of mass growth (mergers vs. diffuse accretion)?",
        "introduction": "\\label{introduction}\n\nThe bottom-up growth of structure is a hallmark of hierarchical cosmological models such as the $\\Lambda$ cold dark matter ($\\Lambda$CDM) model. In these universes, dark matter haloes of lower mass are expected to form earlier, on average, than massive haloes. In observations, theoretical studies, and semi-analytical modelling of galaxy formation (see \\citealt{BaughReview} for a review), the mass of a halo is the key variable upon which many properties of galaxies and their host haloes depend, e.g., formation redshift, galaxy occupation number, colour, morphology, star formation rate, and stellar feedback processes.\n\nRecent work has shown that in addition to the mass, various properties of halo formation and evolution also depend on the environment within which the haloes reside. For instance, at a fixed halo mass, older haloes have been found to be more clustered than younger haloes, and the correlation between clustering strength and formation redshift is stronger for lower mass haloes \\citep{Gottlober02, ShethTormen04, Gao05, Harker06, GaoWhite07, JingSutoMo07, Wechsler06, WangMoJing07, Hahn08, MFM09}. In many of these studies, halo environment is characterised via the halo bias parameter, which is determined from the relative clustering strengths of haloes to the underlying dark matter distribution.\n\nIn Part I of this series (\\citealt{FM09}; henceforth FM09), we have instead chosen to use local overdensities as a more direct measure of halo environment. The focus of the study was to quantify the environmental dependence of the merger rate of haloes. We compared a number of local overdensity variables (both including and excluding the halo mass itself), some of which had been used in earlier studies \\citep{LemsonKauffmann, Harker06, WangMoJing07, Maulbetsch07, Hahn08}. The key finding in FM09 was that halo-halo mergers occur more frequently in denser regions than in voids, and that this environmental dependence is similar regardless of the merger mass ratio (e.g., minor vs major) or the descendant halo mass (galaxy- vs cluster-sized): we found mergers to occur about 2.5 times more frequently in the densest regions than in the emptiest regions. We provided an analytical formula as a function of local density to approximate this environmental trend. This expression can be used with the fit for the global mean rate of \\cite{FM08} (henceforth FM08) to predict halo merger rates as a function of descendant mass, progenitor mass ratio, redshift, and environment over a wide range of parameter space.\n\nIn this paper, we build on our earlier merger rate studies by investigating\nthe mass growth of haloes, and its environmental dependence, via two\nsources: growth from mergers with other haloes (a quantity closely related\nto the results of FM09), and growth from accretion of non-halo material,\nwhich we will refer to as \"diffuse\" accretion. Due to the finite resolution\nof the simulations, we expect a portion of this diffuse component to be\ncomprised of unresolved haloes, which, in a higher-resolution simulation,\nshould largely follow the merger physics and scaling laws of their higher\nmass counterparts in our earlier studies. The diffuse non-halo component,\nhowever, can in principal also contain truly diffuse dark matter particles\nthat either were tidally stripped from existing haloes or were never\ngravitationally bound to any haloes.\n\nAs reported below, we find that diffuse accretion plays an important role\nin contributing to halo mass growth in the Millennium simulation. Moreover,\nwe will show that this growth component correlates with the local halo\nenvironment in an opposite way from the component due to mergers, with\ndiffuse accretion playing an increasingly important role in halo growth in\nthe voids, and mergers playing a more important role in the densest\nregions. This difference suggests that the diffuse component is not simply\nan extension of the resolved haloes down to lower masses, but rather that\nthere is an intrinsic difference between the two components that results in\nthe opposite environmental trends. An implication of this result is that\nMilky-Way size galaxies in voids and those that reside near massive\nclusters may have statistically distinguishable formation history, where\nthe galaxies in voids acquire their baryons more quiescently via diffuse\naccretion, while those in dense regions assemble their baryons mainly via\nmergers.  Such environmental effect can show up in galaxy properties\nsuch as the star formation rates, colors, and morphologies.\n\nThe environmental dependence of halo growths reported in this paper also\nhas far-reaching implications for the much-used analytic theories for halo\ngrowth such as the Extended Press-Schechter (EPS) and excursion set models\n\\citep{PS74, BondEPS,LC93}. These models assume that all dark matter\nparticles reside in haloes, and halo growths depend only on mass and not\nenvironment. As we will elaborate on below, both assumptions are too\nsimplistic and must be modified to account for the results from numerical\nsimulations.\n\nThis paper is organised as follows. \\S\\ref{MillenniumSim} summarises the\nvarious definitions of halo mass and environment used in our analysis, as\nwell as the means by which we extract halo merger trees from the public\ndata in the Millennium simulation. In Sec.~3 we discuss how the two mass\ngrowth rates due to mergers and diffuse accretion, $\\B$ and $\\C$, are\ndefined and computed. The distributions of the rates for the $\\sim 500,000$\nhaloes at $z=0$ and their redshift evolution are presented. The\nenvironmental dependence of halo growths is analysed in Sec.~4. The\ncorrelations of four halo properties with the local density parameter are\ninvestigated: the mass growth rates $\\B$ and $\\C$ (\\S~4.1), the fraction of\na halo's final mass gained via mergers vs. diffuse accretion (\\S~4.2), the\nformation redshift $z_f$ (\\S~4.3), and the composition of the surrounding\nmass reservoir outside of the virial radii of the haloes\n(\\S~4.4). \\S\\ref{Sojourners} discusses a test that we have performed to\nverify that the majority of haloes reside in a similar environmental region\n(e.g. overdense or underdense) throughout their lifetimes. In Sec.~5 we\ninvestigate further the nature of the ``diffuse'' component by varying the\nmass threshold used to define $\\B$ vs $\\C$. We then discuss the\nimplications of our results for the analytic EPS model of halo growth,\nwhich is entirely independent of environment in its basic form and\ntherefore must be modified to account for the various environmental trends\nreported in \\S~4."

        "introduction": "The solar coronal abundance anomaly commonly known as the ``FIP\nEffect'' (or First Ionization Potential Effect), in which low first\nionization potential (FIP) elements ($\\leq$\\,10\\,eV; e.g. Si, Fe, Mg)\nappear enhanced by average factors of 3-4, was already well\nestablished by the time the first observational clues to similar\nabundance anomalies in stellar coronae were uncovered in the 1990's\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Feldman92}.  These clues came from low resolution soft\nX-ray spectra ({\\it GINGA, ASCA, BeppoSAX}), together with moderate\nresolution extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectra obtained by the Extreme\nUltraviolet Explorer (EUVE).  The early stellar studies found evidence\nfor a solar-like FIP Effect in some stars, but for the more active\nstars the abundances pointed toward metal-paucity rather than\nenhancement \\citep[e.g.][ and earlier references therein]{SDrake96}.  \n\nIn the last three years---the beginning\nof the {\\it Chandra} and {\\it XMM-Newton}---era has seen the early\nhints of abundance anomalies fleshed out into an interesting array of\ndiverse abundance patterns in which active stars appear to show signs\nnot only of low FIP element depletion, but also of high FIP element\nenhancements \\citep[][]{Singh95}.\nStudies of solar-like active stars confirm the suspicions engendered\nby earlier work \\citep[e.g.][ and earlier references therein]{Drake96} that a transition from\na metal-depleted to a metal-rich corona occurs as the activity decreases\n\\citep{Guedel02}; this is now better characterised as a change from an \napparently ``inverse FIP Effect'' to a FIP Effect. \n\\citet{Audard03} showed a similar transitions from an \ninverse FIP effect to the absence of an obvious FIP effect for RS CVn binary\nstars with decreasing activity.  Only one star studied in detail to date based on high\nresolution spectra appears to have a coronal composition demonstrably similar\nto that of its underlying photosphere---the subgiant Procyon (F5IV) \n\\citep{Drake95,Raassen02}.\n\n\n\nIn the last decade, the community working on coronal abundances \nhave argued \\citep[e.g.][ and earlier references\ntherein]{Drake03a} that coronal abundances, when better understood,\nmight provide new and powerful diagnostics of the physical processes\nunderpinning stellar coronae.  The emerging patterns of coronal\nabundance anomalies are telling us something about the dynamics\nstructure and heating of coronal plasma; the challenge is in learning\nto read these patterns.\n\nAiming toward this goal, one question that\narises is that of fine tuning of abundance patterns: how similar are\nabundance anomalies in stars that superficially might have similar\nparameters?  \\citet{Drake03b} presented a differential analysis of the\nactive binaries Algol and HR1099---two binary systems whose\ncoronally-dominant components are of very similar spectral type and\nrotation period, but which have had quite different evolutionary\nhistories---and found strong similarities in their quiescent X-ray\nspectra and coronal abundances.  \n\nHere, we note that the young single active star AB Dor and the active\ncomponent of the binary system V471 Tau are both early K dwarfs and\nhave rotation periods of half a day.  Superficially, we might also\nexpect them to have very similar coronal characteristics.  However,\n\\citet{Still03} have derived coronal abundances for V471 Tau based on\nlow resolution ASCA CCD pulse height spectra which are significantly\nlarger than those derived for AB Dor by other authors using similar\nobservational material, in addition to EUVE, XMM-Newton and {\\it\nChandra} spectra\n\\citep[][]{Rucinski95,Mewe96,Ortolani98,Maggio00,Guedel01,Sanz-Forcada03}.\nThe apparent difference between the coronal abundances of the two\nstars might be hinting that their coronae are indeed fundamentally\ndifferent.  Such a dissimilarity might reflect the entirely different\nangular momentum evolution of the two stars: the rapid rotation of\nAB~Dor is due to its relative youth, while that of V471 Tau is due to\ntidal spin-up from interaction with its close companion.\n\nIn this paper, using {\\it Chandra} High and Low Energy Transmission\nGrating spectrograph (HETGS and LETGS) observations, we present a\ncomparative analysis of the coronal X-ray spectra of AB Dor and V471\nTau, with particular emphasis on their abundances.  We first describe\nthe two stars and briefly review earlier work (\\S\\ref{s:stars}), then\nin \\S\\ref{s:obs} we report on the {\\it Chandra} observations and data\nreduction.  The methods used for a differential emission measure\nanalysis together with results obtained are shown in\n\\S\\ref{s:anal}.

        "question": "What is the Expanding Photosphere method for measuring distances to Type II supernovae?",
        "introduction": "Core  collapse supernovae, are thought to be  the final\n results of stellar evolution  for stars with main  sequence masses $\\ga$  10\n   $\\rm  M_\\odot$ with  evolutionary time  scales short  compared to  the age  of the\n universe even at high z (Tammann, 1982; Maza \\& Van den Bergh, 1976; Woosley \\&\n Weaver 1986). These  objects will occur  soon after the  initial star formation\n period and, therefore, can  be used to probe  the structure of the  universe at\n high {\\em z}. These very distant supernovae are all expected to be some variety\n of core collapse supernovae.  E.g. at $z \\sim  5$ to $10$, galaxies are expected  to be\n small and dim and core collapse supernovae may be the brightest objects in  the\n Universe (Miralda-Escud\\'e \\& Rees 1997).\n\nThe light  curves and  spectra depend  sensitively on  the initial stellar mass,\n metallicity,  mass  loss and  explosion  energy. They   show  a wide  range  of\n brightness,  up  to  6  magnitudes,  and  properties  of  their  light   curves\n (Filippenko, 2000;  Patat et  al. 1993  \\& 1994;  Young \\&  Branch, 1989)  that\n prevents their use as standard-candles. However, our knowledge of the event  is\n improving and it may be possible to derive the absolute magnitude in a  similar\n way as Type Ia if appropriate empirical correlations can be identified. \n\nThere is a general agreement that the  explosion of a massive star is caused  by\n the collapse  of its  central parts  into a  neutron star  or a black hole. The\n mechanism of  the energy  deposition into  the envelope  is still debated.  The\n process likely involves the bounce and the formation of the prompt shock  (e.g.\n Van Riper  1978, Hillebrandt  1982), radiation  of the  energy in  the form  of\n neutrinos (e.g. Bowers \\& Wilson 1982),  the interaction of the neutrinos  with\n the material of the  envelope and  various types  of convective motions (  e.g.\n Herant et  al. 1994,  Burrows et  al. 1995,  M\\\"uller \\&  Janka 1997,  Janka \\&\n M\\\"uller 1996), rotation  (e.g. LeBlanc \\& Wilson 1970, Saenz \\& Shapiro  1981,\n M\\\"onchmeyer et al. 1991),  and  magnetic fields (e.g. LeBlanc \\&  Wilson 1970,\n Bisnovati-Kogan 1971).\n\nThe analysis of core collapse supernovae and their use for cosmology is further complicated due  to\n the mounting evidence that the  explosions of massive stars (core  collapse SN)\n are  highly  aspherical  and, consequently,  the  brightness  depends on  their\n orientation  to the  observer (e.g.  H\\\"oflich 1991b).  (1) The  spectra  (e.g.\n SN87A, SN93J, SN94I, SN99em) are significantly polarized indicating  asymmetric\n envelopes (M\\'endez  et al.  1988; H\\\"oflich  1991b; Jeffrey  1991; Wang et al.\n 1996; Wang, Wheeler  \\& H\\\"oflich 1999).  The degree of  polarization  tends to\n vary  inversely with  the mass  of the  hydrogen envelope,  being maximum   for\n SNe~Ib/c events with no hydrogen (Wang et al. 2000, Leonard et al. 2002). For supernovae, with a good\n time and wavelength coverage,   the orientation of the polarization vector tends\n to stay constant both in time  and in the wavelength. This suggests  that there\n is  a   global  symmetry  axis  in  the  ejecta  (Leonard  et  al.  2001).  (2)\n Observations of SN~1987A  showed that radioactive  material was brought  to the\n hydrogen rich layers of the  ejecta very quickly during the  explosion (Tueller\n et al.  1991). (3)  The remnant  of the  Cas~A supernova  shows rapidly  moving\n oxygen-rich matter outside the nominal boundary of the remnant              and\n evidence for two oppositely directed jets of high-velocity material (Fesen   \\&\n Gunderson 1997). (4) Recent X-ray observations with the CHANDRA satellite  have\n shown an  unusual distribution  of iron  and silicon  group elements with large\n scale asymmetry in Cas~A (Huges et al. 2000). (5) After the explosion,  neutron\n stars are observed with high velocities up to 1000  km/s (Strom et al. 1995).\n\nDue to the difficulty  of modeling core collapse  from first principles, a  very\n different line of attack on the explosion problem has been used extensively and\n proved to be successful in  understanding the supernova problem,  SN1987A in\n particular (Arnett et al. 1990,  Hillebrand \\& H\\\"oflich 1991). The  difference\n of characteristic time scales of the  core (a second or less) and  the envelope\n (hours to days)  allows one to  divide the explosion  problem into two  largely\n independent parts  - the  core collapse  and the  ejection of  the envelope. By\n assuming the characteristics of the energy deposition into the envelope  during\n the core collapse, the response of the envelope can be calculated. Thus one can\n study   the   observational   consequences   of   the   explosion   and  deduce\n characteristics  of  the  core  collapse  and  the  progenitor  structure. This\n approach has been  extensively applied in  the framework of  the 1D spherically\n symmetric  formulation. The  major factors  influencing the  outcome have  been\n found to be  the explosion energy  and the progenitor  structure. Recently, the\n same approach has been applied  in multi-dimensions to investigate the  effects\n of asymmetric explosions (e.g. H\\\"oflich et al. 2001). First results show  that\n both  asymmetric  density   structures  and  excitations   are  keys  for   our\n understanding of the global asymmetries in core collapse supernovae.\n\nDespite these  problems, methods  have been  developed to  use these objects for\n distance  determinations,  namely,  SNe~II  that  have  retained  their  H-rich\n envelope. SNe~II represent an important complement to SNe~Ia as a technique  to\n measure cosmological distances. In  principle, the distance to  each individual\n SNe~II  can  be  measured  by  the  {\\it  Baade-Wesselink}  or  {\\it  Expanding\n Photosphere} method in  which the ratio  of the observed  apparent flux to  the\n absolute flux gives the solid angle, and the velocity and elapsed time give the\n radius (e.g. Shaviv  et al. 1985,  H\\\"oflich et al.  1986, Branch et  al. 1988,\n H\\\"oflich 1988, 1991, Schmidt et al. 1994, Leonard et al. 2002). \n \nRecently a sub-group of SNe~II,  SNe~II-P,  has been proposed as good  quasi-standard\n candles (H\\\"oflich et al. 2000,  Hamuy and Pinto 2002), decreasing  the scatter\n in the Hubble diagram. The plateau  in the SN~II-P light curve, that  is caused\n by the recombination of H, is indicative of a massive H envelope. Thanks to the\n plateau the identification does not require any spectra and it is not necessary\n to follow the event  to dimmer phases. We  identify a subclass among  SNe II-P,\n {\\it extreme} SNe II-P, characterized by a {\\it long} plateau, with a  duration\n exceeding  50-60  days. Notice  that  the characteristic  time  of the  plateau\n observed by the telescopes  is increased by a  factor (1+{\\em z}) (ie.  at {\\em\n z}=3, the {\\it bright} observed plateau lasts several months). \n \nAlthough, their statistic is still  very incomplete, {\\it extreme} SNe  II-P are\n probably as   frequent as  SNe Ia  in the  nearby universe  (Cappellaro et  al.\n 1999). In  the years  1998 and  1999 around  a 10$\\%$  of all  SNe II  could be\n classified as  {\\it extreme}  SN~II-P. However,  this is  expected to change at\n {\\it intermediate} redshifts ($z\\approx$ 3-5) when the star formation rate was\n higher (Kravtso \\& Yepes, 2000). At  the other hand, SNe~II maybe the  only SNe\n at $z\\ge$3-5.  Moreover, at  $z\\ge$10, they  may be  the only luminous objects,\n out-shining the host proto-galaxy by a  factor of 100 during more than  2 years\n (Marri \\&  Ferrara 1998).  Cold Dark  Matter (CDM)  models, taken  into account\n gravitational magnification, predict in 100 fields of the Next Generation Space\n Telescope around 850  and 3500 SNII/year  (for Standard and  Lambda CDM models,\n respectively) up to a redshift of $z$=15 (Marri, Ferrara \\& Pozzetti, 2000). \n \nOne key problem to be addressed  will be to determine whether these  events will\n look like local supernovae that explode as red supergiants, or whether, because\n of their low  metallicity they will  all resemble SN  1987A that exploded  as a\n blue supergiant (see also Brunish \\& Truran 1982). Prediction of the properties\n of these  early supernovae  now will  set the  stage for  the work  of upcoming\n observational facilities, like NGST, SNAP and others. \n \nVery few  studies of  light curves  of SNe~II-P  have been  published up to now.\n Litvinova \\&  Nad\\\"ezhin (1983,1985)  presented a  grid for  a range of envelope\n masses between 1 and 16 $\\rm M_\\odot$ that, some 20 years later, still presents\n the  most  comprehensive   study.   The models assumed spherical symmetry and parameterized\ndensity profiles, and 4 basic free parameters: input energy,  the amount of radioactive $Ni$\nand the envelope mass and initial radius. The result\nof these calculations were theoretical bolometric lightcurves which\nwere then converted into V-band lightcurves assuming a black body energy distribution.\n Some of these restrictions  have\n been overcome in the analysis of Eastman  et al. (1994) but this study has  been\n restricted to a star with 15 $\\rm M_\\odot$. Both studies cannot answer the  key\n problems mentioned above.\n In this paper, we link the  pre-SN evolutionary models to SN models. One big advantage\nis that the initial  radius of the SN models is no longer an adjustable parameter but\na result of the physical model and a function of the stellar\nmass. The other   progress is that the hydro models are linked to a radiative transport code,\n so the broad-band lightcurves are much more accurately computed.\nA third  progress provided by this paper is the effect  of metallicity in the resulting \nlightcurves.\n \nFollowing the successful  approach to assume  the characteristics of  the energy\n deposition at  the inner  regions of  the exploding  star, we present explosion\n models and  theoretical light  curves for  a wide  range of  stellar masses and\n metallicities.  The  goal  of  this study  is  to  explore  the sensitivity  of\n different  characteristics  of  the  SN~II-P  light  curves  on  the underlying\n progenitor properties  (initial mass  and metallicity)  and the  kinetic energy\n based on detailed stellar evolution  and LC calculations. Effects due to stellar \nrotation and mass loss  during the  evolution of the  progenitor are not  included.\n Moreover, these calculations do not address the  mechanism of energy deposition, production\nof radioactive Ni, chemical\n mixing and departures from sphericity. One of  our main results  is the\n identification of {\\it extreme} SN~II-P,  as potential candidates to be  use in\n cosmology. Note that we do not intend  to provide a complete grid of models  to\n be  compared with  specific observations.  In this  work, we  present a   study\n focused on core collapse supernovae  to answer the following questions:  How do\n the light curves of core collapse supernovae depend on the metallicity that  is\n expected to decrease with redshift? Can  we identify a subclass among the  core\n collapse  supernovae  that may  be  used as  quasi-standard  candles, and  what\n accuracy do we expect?  Can this subclass be  identified purely by their  light\n curves, without  a follow-up  that requires  to {\\it go}  much fainter than maximum\n light? \n\nThe outline of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 the numerical methods  used\n for the evolution,  explosion and light  curves computations are  described, in\n Section 3 the influence of  the progenitor properties and explosion  parameters\n on the light curves are analyzed, and finally, in Section 4, we highlights  the\n main conclusions and short-comes of our study."

        "question": "What is the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and how can it be detected using cosmic voids?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nIn the standard cosmological model, the universe is homogeneous and isotropic on large scales.  The seeds of present-day large-scale structure of the universe are formed from the highly Gaussian and nearly scale-invariant power spectrum of matter density \\citep{Hinshaw_ea2013, PlanckXIII_2015}.  However, on small scales, the hierarchical clustering of matter leads to formations of complex cosmic structure such as clusters of galaxies, walls, filaments, and voids \\citep{Boylan-Kolchin_ea2009}.  Among all of the large-scale objects in the universe,  cosmic voids, which are large underdensities in the matter distribution, occupy the vast majority of the universe and hence provide the largest volume-based test on theories of structure formation \\citep{Ceccarelli_ea2006}.  Being interesting objects in their own right, they contain a wealth of information on the fundamental properties of the universe.  For example, the low-density environment of voids is a perfect place to study galaxies, as the galaxies are expected not to be affected by the complex astrophysical processes that modify galaxies in high-density environments and allows galaxies to evolve independently without environmental effects \\citep{Beygu_ea2013, Penny_ea2015}.  In addition, since voids occupy the cosmic volume where the matter density is lowest, the difference between dark energy and modified gravity models for cosmic acceleration could be distinguishable within cosmic voids \\citep{Clampitt_ea2013, Cai_ea2015, Barreira_ea2015, Zivick_ea2015}.  \n\nThe computational approach called $N$-body dark matter simulations is one of the best tools to empirically understand various void properties such as number functions \\citep{Sheth_vandeWeygaert2004, Jennings_ea2013} and void ellipticity functions \\citep{Biswas_ea2010}.  However, the definition of voids is rather vague, and various definitions exist in the literature; some are more suitable for theoretical calculations, while the others are more suitable for observations or $N$-body simulations.  This variety of definitions renders comparison of theoretical predictions on void properties and observations difficult.  \\texttt{ZOBOV} (Zones Bordering On Voidness; \\cite{Neyrinck_2008}) and \\texttt{WVF} (Watershed Void Finder;\\cite{Platen_ea2007}) are two of the popular void-finding algorithms.  Both methods are based on some tessellation methods and the watershed concept of defining voids.  \\texttt{ZOBOV} requires no free parameters or assumptions about the shape and is based on Voronoi tessellation.  However, the \\texttt{ZOBOV} voids are unsmooth and rather edgy.  \\texttt{WVF} also requires no free parameters and is based on a watershed transform.  However, \\texttt{WVF} uses several techniques to smooth the density field so that the \\texttt{WVF} voids are not edgy.  With void identification algorithms being progressively developed for galaxy redshift surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), cosmic voids are being continually found, amounting to releases of public voids catalogs \\citep{Pan_ea2012, Sutter_ea2012a, Sutter_ea2014a, Nadathur_2016}.\n\nRecently, there has be an increasing amount of attention on voids as objects for various aspects of cosmological studies.  The dynamic of voids and redshift-space distortion \\citep{Kaiser_1987} is one of the probes of the growth of large-scale structure.  The amount of dark matter in the universe could be obtained from the peculiar velocity fields \\citep{Courtois_ea2012}.  The relationship between their extent angular size and the distance along the line of sight, known as the Alcock--Paczy\\'{n}ski test \\citep{Alcock_Paczynski1979}, is predicted to be a promising probe of dark energy by using a stacking method to obtain a statistically averaged shape of voids in 2D or 3D spaces.  By stacking a large number of voids, one would expect the difference in radial and transverse direction to be directly related to the product of angular distance and the Hubble parameter \\citep{Lavaux_Wandelt2012, Sutter_ea2012b, Sutter_ea2014b}.  Another geometrical study, the evolution of the ellipticity of voids, could be used as a tool in practice to constrain the dark energy equation of state \\citep{Lee_Park2009, Bos_ea2012}.  The Integrated Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) effect \\citep{Sachs_Wolfe1967} caused by the evolution of the gravitational potential within voids can also be detected \\citep{Granett_ea2008, Cai_ea2014, Chen_Kantowski2015, Hotchkiss_ea2015, Ilic_ea2013, PlanckXXI_2015}.\n\nThe measurement of weak gravitational lensing probes the matter distribution by means of the deflection of light from the background sources.  The trajectories of photons from background sources are bent toward gravitating matter due to the distortion of spacetime caused by gravitational lensing \\citep{Einstein_1936}.  The scenario is reversed when voids are acting as the sources of gravitational lenses instead of dark matter.  The delensing effect of voids has been investigated and recently observed through the distortions of background galaxies by a stacking method that enhances the signal \\citep{Higuchi_ea2013, Krause_ea2013, Melchior_ea2014, Clampitt_Jain2015, Gruen_ea2016}.\n\n\\setcounter{footnote}{0}\n\nThe cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation, which is the signal from surface of the last scattering surface, exists as the ubiquitous background for gravitational lensing.  The gravitational anti-lensing effect of voids has been recently investigated by \\citep{Bolejko_ea2013}, \\citep{Chen_ea2015}, \\citep{Das_Spergel2009}. The CMB signals that are lensed by multiple voids are also a promising tool to obtain good constraints on cosmological parameters \\citep{Chantavat_ea2016}. \\textit{Planck} \\citep{PlanckXV_2015} has released lensing potential maps from the CMB\\footnote{Can be downloaded from \\href{http://www.sharelatex.com}{http://pla.esac.esa.int/}} that utilized quadratic estimators that exploit the statistical anisotropy induced by lensing \\citep{Okamoto_Hu2003}.  From a theoretical point of view, if the matter density distribution within a void, known as a void profile, is known, then the lensing potential could be computed and vice versa.  The statistical average void density profile known as the universal void profile (here after, HSW; \\cite{Hamaus_ea2014a}) has been released and potentially could be exploited to predict the lensing effect of voids at various sizes and redshifts with only a few parameters (more in \\S\\ref{sec:theory}).  Hence, from the lensing potential data from \\textit{Planck}, one could, in principle, derive the HSW parameters.  This would be a good consistency check if the HSW void profile could be reverse-engineered from observables.\n\nThe goals of this article are (1) to extract the stacked lensing potential from \\textit{Planck} lensing data by cross-correlation with voids from SDSS data \\citep{Sutter_ea2014b}, (2) to compare and cross-examine the derived HSW void parameters from the \\textit{Planck} lensing potential map with other methods, and (3) to better understand the effect of gravitational lensing from voids in the \\textit{Planck} lensing data.  We shall begin with a description of the void catalog from the SDSS galaxy redshift survey \\citep{Sutter_ea2014b} and \\textit{Planck} lensing data \\citep{PlanckXV_2015} in \\S\\ref{sec:data}.  The extraction and cross-correlation methods are also discussed.  In \\S\\ref{sec:theory}, we describe the HSW void profile parameterization, and a brief overview of the gravitational lensing effect with voids is also introduced.  Our parameter estimation is described in \\S\\ref{sec:paraest}, and the results are shown in \\S\\ref{sec:results}.  The discussions and conclusions are given in \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}.  Throughout this article, our fiducial cosmological parameters are $\\Omega_M = 0.315$, $\\Omega_\\Lambda = 0.685$, $H_0 = 67.3\\ \\text{km s}^{-1} \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$, $w = -1$, and $\\Omega_k = 0$, which is consistent with a flat $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology from \\textit{Planck} 2013 + WMAP polarization maximum likelihood cosmological parameters \\citep{PlanckXVI}."

        "introduction": "The seminal papers by \\citet{butcher:78,butcher:84} gave rise to an\nentire generation of studies on the evolution of galaxy populations in\nclusters.  Their observations of an increasing number of blue cluster\nmembers with increasing redshift, christened the Butcher-Oemler (B-O)\neffect, have since been confirmed with photometric\n\\citep{couch:94,dressler:94,rakos:95,lubin:96,dressler:97,couch:98,margoniner:00}\nand spectroscopic studies\n\\citep{lavery:86,couch:87,newberry:88,lavery:92,dressler:92,abraham:96b,caldwell:97,ellingson:01,tran:03b}.\nHowever, the origins of the B-O effect have yet to be fully understood.\n\nSeveral early studies suggested the B-O effect was due to galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions \\citep{lavery:88,lavery:92,dressler:94,couch:94}.  More\nrecently, galaxy infall has become a favored mechanism for increasing\nthe blue fraction in clusters, especially at intermediate redshifts\n\\citep{kauffmann:95,couch:98,vandokkum:98a,ellingson:01,fairley:02}.  A\npanoramic imaging study of A851 ($z=0.41$) by \\citet{kodama:01b}\nsuggests that the transition from predominantly blue to red galaxy\ncolors occurs most often in the subclumps outside the cluster core.\nHowever, the observations needed to understand the physical mechanisms\ndriving the evolution of cluster galaxies, $e.g.$ redshifts,\nmorphologies, and spectral types, are difficult to obtain.  Although\nsubstructure in massive clusters is quite common and is attributed to\nthe continued accretion of galaxies, the evidence linking galaxy infall\nto the B-O effect, $e.g.$ the spatial and kinematic segregation of\nearly and late-type members \\citep{dressler:80,fisher:98,biviano:02},\nremains circumstantial.\n\nKnowing whether the B-O effect is due to galaxy infall is particularly\nimportant if we are to explain the unexpected deficit of S0 galaxies\nobserved at intermediate redshifts\n\\citep{dressler:97,fasano:00,lubin:02}.  These studies suggest that the\nS0's in nearby clusters form out of the excess of spirals observed at\nhigher redshifts, $i.e.$ the B-O galaxies \\citep[although for an\nalternative explanation, see][]{andreon:98}.  If S0's form from\ninfalling spirals, then this would mean that most S0's in nearby\nclusters originated in the field.\n\nTo assess how galaxy infall, the Butcher-Oemler effect, and the\npossible progenitors of S0 members are related, we present a detailed\nstudy of MS~2053--04, a massive, X-ray luminous galaxy cluster\n\\citep{stocke:91,luppino:92} at $z\\sim0.6$.  With extensive Keck/LRIS\nspectroscopy, we identify 149 members and measure MS2053's velocity\ndispersion and mass.

        "question": "What is the total energy emitted in neutrinos during a core-collapse supernova event?",
        "introduction": "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n\n\nMassive stars ($M \\ge 8$ M$_{\\odot}$) culminate their evolution as core collapse supernovae (CC-SNe).  \n Such supernovae  are of particular interest because they are unique sources \nfor all three flavors of energetic neutrinos.  \nAn intensive flux of neutrinos with total energy of order $\\sim 10^{53}$ ergs is  emitted over an interval of $\\sim 10$ s\nduring core-collapse supernovae.\nThis energy corresponds  to almost 99$\\%$ of the released gravitational binding energy during the formation of  a 1.4 $M_\\odot$\nproto-neutron star, and this neutrino luminosity is nearly equally partitioned among  the three  neutrino flavors,  i.e. \n$\\nu_{{\\rm e}, \\mu, \\tau}$ and their antiparticles.  \nIn the case that a  black hole is formed instead of a neutron star in the core-collapse of more massive stars,  a similar energy $\\sim 10^{53}$ ergs is expected to be carried away\nby more energetic neutrinos during a shorter time interval  $\\le 1$ s.   If however, a massive star ends its life as an ONeMg supernova, the neutrino flux and energies are diminished.\nIn this paper we investigate the possibility of detecting the various contributions to the supernova relic neutrino background in a $10^6$ ton next-generation water \\v{C}erenkov detector such as the proposed Hyper-Kamiokande.\n\nNeutrinos are weakly interacting elementary particles, and therefore emerge \nfrom deep within the interior of core collapse supernovae.  As such, supernova neutrinos \nhave the potential to provide  information regarding  the physical processes that take place inside the star.\nFor the same reason, the emitted neutrinos can almost freely stream  from the time of the early galaxy formation epoch\nuntil the present time without  absorption in the intervening  intergalactic material.  \nSince massive stars have lifetimes  ($\\sim 10^6$ to $10^7$ y) that are much shorter than \nthe cosmic age ($\\sim 10^{10}$y),  supernova neutrinos can be considered to have been emitted almost continuously since  the very earliest phase of galaxy formation. \nThis  diffuse galactic background of  accumulated neutrinos due to SNe is referred to (e.g.~\\cite{tot96} and refs.~therein) as the  supernova relic neutrinos (SRNs).\n\nThe detection of these supernova relic neutrinos and their energy spectrum could be used  to study the supernova history from the beginning of \n galaxy formation \\citep{hop06}.  Such data could also provide information on\nneutrino properties such as flavor oscillations \\citep{cha11,lun12} and/or the neutrino temperatures  produced in supernova explosions. One may even be able to discern \\citep{Nak13} the shock revival time from the detected spectrum of relic neutrinos.\nIndeed, a next generation Hyper-Kamiokande detector with a mega-ton of pure water is currently  being planned with a goal of measuring the relic neutrino background spectrum.  Moreover, results from the Super-Kamiokande collaboration \\citep{SK12} already place interesting limits on the total neutrino energies and temperatures from the background spectrum of supernova relic neutrinos \\citep{SK12,Sek13}.\n\nHowever, theoretical predictions of the detection rate of supernova relic neutrinos are still subject to \na number of  uncertainties. \nThese uncertainties include   the star formation rate and/or  supernova rate and \nthe spectral energy distributions of the three flavors of supernova neutrinos. \nThese  in turn  depend upon the explosion mechanism, whether the final remnant is a neutron star or black hole,\n the equation of state (EoS) for proto-neutron stars, and  the possibility of neutrino oscillations and self interactions, etc.\n One goal of the present work is to better clarify these uncertainties.\n\nIn this context, it is of particular interest to the present work that an apparent   discrepancy  has been noted  \\citep{hor11}    between \nthe supernova rate deduced from observations of the cosmic SFR [e.g. \\cite{hop06}] at multiple wavelengths, and the detected core-collapse supernova rate ($R_{SN}$)\n\\citep{lea11,li11a, li11b,maoz11}.   \nThe inferred $R_{SN}$ in the redshift range 0 $\\le z \\le$ 1 \nis about a factor of two smaller than that deduced from the measured SFR.  This has been dubbed \\citep{hor11} as  the \"supernova rate problem.\"\nThis discrepancy suggests that either about  half of all massive stars are obscured when they explode, or that\nthey do not explode as luminous supernovae.\n\nOne explanation for this latter possibility  that we explore in this paper is that some of the expected luminous supernovae actually end their lives as faint \nONeMg supernovae.  Such supernovae should result from progenitor masses  in the range 8$M_{\\odot} \\le M \\le 10M_{\\odot}$ \\citep{Isern91}.\n%If there is a wider mass range for these SNe and/or an enhanced initial mass function (IMF) for this mass range in the redshift range of $0 \\le z \\le 1$,   \n%this might explain the discrepancy.\n%Since the luminosity of  ONeMg supernovae is known to be an order of magnitude smaller than\n%that of ordinary SNe, they may not be observed efficiently.  The contribution of ONeMg supernovae has been considered in \\cite{lun12}.  Here we expand on that work by analyzing the uncertainties and possible role and detectability for an enhanced fraction of ONeMg SNe as a solution to the supernova rate problem.\n%However, this scenario may be unlikely because  the required  IMF has not been detected  in  external galaxies.\n\nAnother aspect   \nis that a significant fraction of relatively massive stars with progenitor masses\nin the range $M \\ge  25$ M$_{\\odot} $\nevolved to failed supernovae leaving black hole remnants rather than to become SNIb,c.  In this case,  the ejecta  falls back \nonto the central black hole.  These failed supernovae\nhave small  explosion kinetic energies  and are much less luminous.  In a series of papers \\citep{lun09,Yang11,kee12} the contribution of failed SNe to\nthe relic neutrino signal has been analyzed.  Here, we expand upon that study \nby considering the  role and associated uncertainties and detectability  of failed SNe and also the possibility of an enhanced fraction of such events \nas a means to resolve the supernova rate problem. \n\n\nTheoretical studies \\citep{sum05,sum08,Nak08} of  such failed supernovae, however,   show slightly higher \nneutrino luminosity with much higher neutrino temperatures than those of ordinary supernovae.\nDepending upon  the EoS employed, the difference in neutrino temperatures among the different flavors is\neven larger than the difference in ordinary supernovae.\n%Although it takes only about 500 ms to 1 s before the apparent horizon \n%of the black hole appears,\n%the proto-neutron star still ejects an enormous   flux of neutrinos and their total energy \n%is even larger than that of ordinary core-collapse supernovae.\nThis  opens up the possibility that the spectrum of energetic \nrelic supernova neutrinos could be  dominated by a contribution  from failed supernovae.\nA detection of the spectrum of these relic neutrinos could thus provide insight into the supernova rate problem as well as neutrino oscillation effects and the effects of \nthe EoS on  supernova collapse \\citep{lun12}.\n\nOne  purpose of the present work, therefore,  is to explore the possibility  \nthat one  can solve the \"supernova rate problem\" by detecting \nthe energy spectrum of supernova relic neutrinos.\nFor this purpose we first analyze possible uncertainties in  both the measured core-collapse supernova rate ($R_{SN}$) \nand star formation rate (SFR) \nover the redshift range of 0 $\\le z \\le$ 7. \nWe then study the sources of uncertainty in  theoretical \ncalculations of the relic neutrino detection rate.  \n\nIf we consider  only observations for which  the dust correction was taken  into account,\nwe find that  the supernova rate problem has a large uncertainty, i.e.  $\\sim1.8^{+1.6}_{-0.6}$ for the ratio of the supernova rate deduced from the observed massive star formation rate (SFR) to  the directly observed core-collapse supernova rate $R_{SN}({\\rm Obs}$).  This is statistically consistent with no supernova rate problem.  \n Moreover, if we consider that a significant fraction of massive stars will end their lives as faint ONeMg SNe or as failed SNe leading to a black hole remnant, then the ratio reduces to  $\\sim1.1^{+1.1}_{-0.4}$ and the rate problem is essentially solved. \n\nWe next analyze the uncertainties in detecting this solution to the supernova rate problem.  \nWe adopt an ensemble of published and unpublished  supernova simulation models \nin order to estimate the uncertainty in the source neutrino luminosities and temperatures.   \nThese are taken from core-collapse supernova models leaving either a neutron star or black hole (including  possible collapsar gamma-ray burst models) as a remnant, \nor leading to ONeMg supernovae.\nWe also incorporate several recent studies of  supernova nucleosynthesis\nin order to constrain the neutrino temperatures.\n\nAfter clarifying and minimizing the temperature uncertainties from the theoretical calculations, \nwe study the effects of different SN models, equations of state, and the effects of the neutrino oscillations on the detected spectrum.  We explore  \nwhether one can  measure the neutrino temperature, distinguish the EoS, \nand even constrain the unknown neutrino\nmass hierarchy,\nthrough the sensitivity of the resultant detected neutrino spectrum.\nFinally, we  explore whether  an enhanced  contribution of  \"failed supernovae\" \nmight be detectable and thereby  confirm whether these events  are the source of the  \"supernova rate problem\"   \\citep{hor11}."

        "introduction": "We have recently completed CANDELSz7,  an ESO spectroscopic large program using  FORS2 at the VLT. Our goal is to systematically \n study the Ly$\\alpha$ emission in galaxies from z=5.5 to z=7.2 selected in the CANDELS fields (Grogin et al. 2011, Koekemoer et al. 2011).

In  about 20\\% we detect the Ly$\\alpha$ line, with EW in some cases as low as 5 \\AA.  From this sample we  have selected the seven brightest galaxies  with: (1)  precise  redshifts between 6.6 and 7.2 \nfrom Ly$\\alpha$ emission; (2)  $SFR > 15-30 M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}$  based on UV emission, assuming the Kennicutt (1998) calibration with no dust correction. \nWhile these LBGs all have Ly$\\alpha$ emission, the majority of them would not be selected by the usual LAE criteria because the lines only have modest EW. \n\nDuring Cycle-3 we  obtained observations for four of the seven galaxies approved in program 2015.1.01105.S.  In Table 1 we show their optical properties. NTTDF6345 was part  of one of our early studies (Pentericci et al. 2011),  while the other galaxies were confirmed by CANDELSz7.

        "question": "How does the [O II]/H\u03b1 emission line ratio in the diffuse ionized gas change with increasing distance from the galactic disk in edge-on galaxies?",
        "introduction": "When examining ionized gas, it is common practice to distinguish between\nclassical \\ion{H}{2} regions (Str\\\"omgren spheres around OB stars) and diffuse\nionized gas (DIG), the gas outside the boundaries of the Str\\\"omgren spheres.\nWhile \\ion{H}{2} regions are created by photoionization, the ionization\nprocesses for the DIG are less well known. Many attempts have been made to\nexplain the DIG by photoionization models (e.g. Domg\\\"orgen \\& Mathis 1994;\nSokolowski 1992), while a few studies address the possibility of shock\nexcitation (e.g. Sivan, Stasi\\'nska, \\& Lequeux 1986). In recent years, DIG was\nfound not only in the disks of galaxies, but also far above the stellar disks in\nthe halo of the \\objectname[]{Milky Way} and in several edge--on galaxies at\nheights of more than 1\\,kpc (e.g. Reynolds 1985; Rand, Kulkarni, \\& Hester\n1990). Questions therefore arise about where this extraplanar DIG (eDIG) comes\nfrom and how it is ionized.\n\nDynamical models of galaxies like `galactic fountains' \\citep{shap} and\n`chimneys' \\citep{norman} describe how gas can be transported from the disk into\nthe halo. Supernova explosions heating the gas in the disk and pushing it up\ninto the halo are important for both the dynamics and the ionization of the gas\nin the halo. Due to the high velocities in this ejected gas, shocks can arise\nand ionize the gas far above the disk. The models of runaway O stars leaving the\ndisk and moving into the halo (e.g. Gies 1987), leaking ionizing photons from\nthe disk into the halo due to low density gas (Miller \\& Cox 1993; Dove \\& Shull\n1994) as well as the theory of photons created by neutrino decay \\citep{sciama}\nare further attempts to explain the ionization of extraplanar DIG.\n\nBoth \\citet{martin} and \\citet{rand} were able to explain the run of several of\nthe observed emission line ratios from \\ion{H}{2} regions to the DIG with\ncomposite models. Their models consisted of photoionization and one additional\nionization process (shock ionization, turbulent mixing layers). This additional\nprocess was needed to explain the rise in the [\\ion{O}{3}]/H$\\beta$ line ratio\nwith increasing distance from the disk. However, even with these composite\nmodels it was not possible to explain the constant [\\ion{S}{2}]/[\\ion{N}{2}]\nline ratio, which was observed in \\objectname[]{NGC\\,891} \\citep{rand}, as well\nas in the \\objectname[]{Milky Way} \\citep{haffner} and other galaxies\n\\citep{otte}. These data led \\citet{haffner} to the conclusion that the electron\ntemperature increases with increasing distance from the midplane of the\ngalaxies.\n\nA rise in temperature can explain both the growing [\\ion{O}{3}]/H$\\beta$ ratio\nas well as the constant [\\ion{S}{2}]/[\\ion{N}{2}] ratio with increasing galactic\naltitude $|z|$ without invoking an additional ionization mechanism at high\n$|z|$. Such a rise in electron temperature also should effect the\n[\\ion{O}{2}]/H$\\alpha$ line ratio. The [\\ion{O}{2}]\\,$\\lambda$3727\\AA\\ emission\nline provides important additional information about the ionization and heating\nprocesses in the DIG because of its high excitation energy.

The relativistic outflows are expected to ultimately \nform a fireball, which is \ngood for explaining the observed afterglow (e.g.,  \\citet{pira99}).\nIn addition, it is suggested that the strong magnetic fields in the\ncores of order of $10^{15} \\gauss$ play also an active role both for driving \nthe magneto-driven jets and for extracting a significant amount of\nenergy from the central engine (e.g.,\n\\cite{whee00,thom04,uzde07a} and see references therein). \n\nTo obtain clear understanding of such scenarios, it is ultimately \n necessary to perform stellar core-collapse simulations, which trace\nall the phases in a consistent manner starting from the stellar core-collapse, \ncore-bounce, shock-stall, stellar explosion (phase 1) or BH formation\nand the formation of accretion disk (phase 2), energy\ndeposition to the funnel region by neutrinos and/or magnetic fields\n(phase 3), to the launching of the fireballs (phase 4). \nHere for convenience we call each stage as phase 1, 2, etc.\nThe requirement for the numerical modeling to this end is highly\ncomputationally expensive, which necessitates the multidimensional \nmagnetohydrodynamic(MHD) simulations not only with general relativity for handling the BH\nformation, but also with the multi-angle neutrino transfer for\ntreating highly anisotropic neutrino radiation from the disks.\nThus various approximate approaches have been undertaken.\nAll the studies, which we will mention below, are complimentary in the sense that \nthe different epochs are focused on, with the different initial\nconditions for the numerical modeling being taken.\n\nAs for the phase 1, the roles of rapid rotation and magnetic fields have been \n elaborately investigated to study \nthe formation of magnetars and its implications to\nthe collapsars (e.g., \\citet{taki04,kota04a,sawa05,ober06a,suwa07a,burr07,taki09} and \ncollective references in \\citet{kotake_rev}).\nAfter the failed or weak explosion in the postbounce phase,\nthe accretion to the central objects may lead to the formation of a BH (phase 2), \n which several general relativistic studies have focused on \\citep{shib06,seki07}. \nTreating the BH as an absorbing boundary or using the fixed metric\napproaches, the numerical studies of \nthe phase 3 are concerned with the initiation of the outflows from the funnel\nregion of the disk to the acceleration of the jets as a result of the\nneutrino heating and/or MHD processes till the jets become mildly relativistic. \nNumerical studies of the phase 4 are \nmainly concerned with the dynamics later on, namely, the jet\npropagation to the breakout from the star, when the acceleration of\nthe jets to the high Lorentz factor is expected (see, e.g., \n\\citet{aloy00,zhan03,mizu07} and references therein).\n\n\nHere we focus on the phase 3, which has also been extensively investigated thus \nfar (e.g., \\citet{macf99,prog03c,devi05,hawl06,mizu06,fuji06,mcki07b,komi07a,naga07,bark08}). \nA general outcome of the MHD studies among them \n(e.g., \\citet{prog03b,prog03c,mizu06,fuji06,naga07,naga09})\nis that if the central progenitor cores \n have significant angular momentum ($\\approx 10^{17}$ $\\rm {cm}^2$/s) \nwith strong magnetic fields ($\\gtrsim 10^{11}$ G), \nmagneto-driven jets can be launched strong \nenough to expel the matter along the rotational axis within several seconds after the \nonset of collapse. \nThe combination of such \nrapid rotation and strong magnetic fields %\n is recently considered to be possible for rapidly rotating metal-poor stars, \n which experience the so-called chemically homogeneous evolution in the main sequence \n\\citep{woos06,yoon05}.\n  It should be noted that the angular momentum of those GRB progenitors \n($\\approx 10^{16}$ $\\rm {cm}^2$/s), albeit not a final answer due to \n much uncertainty in the stellar mass loss, angular momentum transport, and \nmagnetorotational instability (MRI)\n(e.g., \\citet{vink05}, \\citet{detmers08}), \nis relatively smaller than those assumed in most of the \nprevious collapsar simulations.\n Employing such a GRB progenitor, it was reported by\n \\citet{dess08} based on the 2D radiation MHD core-collapse simulations that \n too much angular momentum is not favorable for collapsars because the \nMHD explosions in the immediate postbounce phase are so strong that the BH \nformations are circumvented.\n\nThese situations motivate us to focus on slower rotation of the central core\nin the context of collapsar models.\nAs for the initial magnetic fields, we choose to explore relatively smaller \nfields ($\\lesssim 10^{10}$ G), which has been less investigated so far.\n Paying particular attention to the smaller angular momentum, it takes much \nlonger time to amplify the magnetic fields large enough to launch the MHD jets than \n previously estimated. By performing special relativistic MHD simulations, \n which enable us to follow a long-term evolution over $\\sim$ 10 s, \n we aim to clarify how the properties and the mechanism of the MHD jets could \nchange with the initial angular momentum and the initial magnetic fields. \nIt is noted here that the long-term simulation could be \n important for understanding the X-ray flares recently discovered \nin a number of long GRBs (e.g., \\citet{prog06}).\n  As for the microphysics, we include both realistic equation of state (EOS)\n  and neutrino cooling, which have been often \n neglected or oversimplified (see, however, \\citet{fuji06,naga07}).\n By doing so, we estimate the neutrino luminosities emitted from the accretion disks, \n and clarify what conditions are pivotal to make the energy depositions via neutrino \npair annhilation as efficient as the magnetically-driven \nprocesses for energetizing jets.\n The range of specific angular momentum required for the progenitors of collapsars \nwas predicted to be \n $3 < j_{16}(\\equiv j/10^{16}{\\rm cm}^2 ~{\\rm s}^{-1}) < 20$ by \n a pioneering collapsar simulation but without MHD\n \\citep{macf99}. This is because if angular momentum is too small, \nmass element cannot stay at the last stable orbit, \nwhile if too large, mass element cannot fall into compact objects, and thus \n cannot form disk, suppressing the sufficient energy release for GRBs. \nBased on our results, we hope to understand how this \n criterion would change if MHD effects are taken into account.\n  \n\nWe summarize the numerical methods in \\S\\ref{sec:num}.\n\\S 3 is devoted to the initial models.\n  The main results are described in \\S\\ref{sec:results}.\n We summarize our results \nand discuss their implications in  \\S\\ref{sec:discussion}. \nDetails of the treatments of neutrino cooling/heating \nin the framework of special relativity are given in the appendices."

        "introduction": "\\label{intro}\nThe LCDM model for structure formation in the universe has been very\nsuccessful on large scales (\\eg\\ Springel, Frenk \\& White 2006), but\nhas run into a number of difficulties on galaxy scales.  One\ndifficulty is that the predicted dark matter density in the halos of\nbright galaxies appears to be greater than that inferred from the best\nobservational data (\\eg\\ Weiner \\etal\\ 2001; Dutton \\etal\\ 2007) or\nfrom dynamical friction constraints (Debattista \\& Sellwood 2000); see\nSellwood (2008b) for a review.\n\nA number of possible solutions have been suggested.  Binney, Gerhard\n\\& Silk (2001) and others suggest that the halo density can be reduced\nby feed-back from star formation, but Gnedin \\& Zhao (2002) show that\nthe density cannot be reduced by more than a factor two, even for the\nmost extreme feedback, unless the baryons are unreasonably\nconcentrated.  Weinberg \\& Katz (2002) propose that dynamical friction\nbetween a bar and the halo can reduce the central density, but\nSellwood (2008a) shows that significant reductions require extreme\nbars and remove a large fraction of the angular momentum from the\nbaryons.\n\nA third possible solution was proposed by El-Zant, Shlosman \\& Hoffman\n(2001, hereafter EZ01), who suggested that dynamical friction between\nheavy gas clumps and dark matter would transfer energy to the dark\nmatter, thereby reducing its inner density.  \n\nEssentially EZ01 propose a process of mass segregation that allows the\nbaryonic matter to displace the dark matter.  If it works, it would\namount to baryon settling with halo {\\it de}-compression, as Dutton\n\\etal\\ (2007) argued would be required to improve agreement of LCDM\npredictions with scaling relations of $\\sim L_*$ galaxies.  Kassin, de\nJong \\& Weiner (2006) also remark that rotation curves could be more\neasily reconciled with LCDM predictions if halo compression could\nsomehow be avoided.  Tonini, Lapi \\& Salucci (2006) use the idea to\npredict rotation curves for galaxies.  Mo \\& Mao (2004) apply the\nmechanism to pre-process small halos in the very early stages of\nstructure formation.\n\nA similar, but significantly distinct, idea was tested by Gao \\etal\\\n(2004), who argue that some unspecified attractor mechanism causes\nviolent relaxation processes to reset the collisionless mass profile\nof the combined dark and baryonic matter.  Since violent mergers\ndisrupt disks, Gao \\etal\\ clearly invoke a different process from the\nslow frictional in-spiral of baryonic clumps proposed by EZ01.\n\nEZ01 suppose that the baryons collect into dense mass clumps which\nthen sink to the center by dynamical friction.  They assume: (1) the\nclumps are small enough they do not collide and (2) are sufficiently\ntightly bound that they are not tidally disrupted.  They also\nimplicitly assume that the dense clumps (3) maintain their coherence\nindependent of any internal physical processes (such as possible star\nformation) and (4) they require the mass clumps to contain little dark\nmatter.\n\nThe in-spiral of massive clumps has been studied extensively and we do\nnot attempt a complete list of references.  Van den Bosch \\etal\\\n(1999) estimate the infall rate of dark matter sub-clumps through\ndynamical friction.  Ma \\& Boylan-Kolchin (2004) simulate a mass\nspectrum of satellites each composed of particles moving within a main\nhalo; they find that the combined density profile of the inner halo\nand disrupted satellites can either steepen or flatten, depending on\nthe properties of the clumps.  Arena \\& Bertin (2007) study both the\nstrength of the friction force and the effect on the density profile\nfor both cuspy and cored initial galaxy profiles.\n\nHere we undertake a direct test of the proposal by EZ01, using\nself-consistent $N$-body simulations, in order to determine the clump\nmass required to effect a significant density reduction.  We first\nderive the settling time-scale for single massive clumps in cuspy\nhalos, and then present simulations containing an ensemble of heavy\nclumps in a background of light halo particles.  We discuss the\nphysical plausibility of their assumptions in the concluding section.\n\nEl-Zant \\etal\\ (2004, hereafter EZ04) apply the same idea to account\nfor the flattened density profile reported by Sand \\etal\\ (2002) in\nthe galaxy cluster MS 2137-23.  In this context, they identify the\ngalaxies themselves as the heavy baryonic clumps that settle to the\ncluster center.  Both they, and Nipoti \\etal\\ (2004), present\nsimulations to show that the in-spiral of galaxies can cause the\nbackground dark matter density profile to flatten, although both\nstudies neglect the DM halos attached to the infalling galaxies.

        "question": "What causes the variability in the quiescent X-ray emission of soft X-ray transients on timescales longer than one day?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:introduction}\n\nThe orbiting X-ray observatories \\chandra\\ and \\xmm\\ have dramatically\nimproved our understanding of soft X-ray transients (SXTs): binaries\ncontaining a neutron star or black hole primary and having well-defined\naccretion outbursts separated by long periods of quiescence.  These\nobjects are typically defined as having a ratio of outburst flux to\nquiescent flux $> 1000$.  Two puzzles are pertinent to this work.  The\nfirst is whether the thermal component of the neutron star's quiescent\nluminosity is powered by accretion or by thermal emission from the\ncooling core.  This has implications for the observed contrast in the\nquiescent luminosity between transient black holes and neutron stars\n\\citep{narayan97a,menou99,garcia.mcclintock.ea:new,kong.ea:bh_xrn}.\n\n\\citet{brown98:transients} showed that compression-induced\nreactions---electron captures, neutron emissions, and pycnonuclear\nreactions \\citep{bisnovatyi-kogan79:_noneq_x,sato79,haensel90a}---in\nthe inner crust of an accreting neutron star release enough heat to\npower a cooling luminosity of order $10^{33}\\usp\\ergspersecond$ in\nquiescence.  In the absence of neutrino emission from the core the\nquiescent thermal flux is proportional to the mean outburst flux\n\\citep{brown98:transients,colpi.geppert.ea:charting}.  Motivated by\nthe match between the expected quiescent luminosity and that observed\nfrom neutron star SXT's in quiescence,\n\\citet{rutledge.ea.99:refit,rutledge.ea.00:BH} fit archival \\rosat\\\nand \\asca\\ observations of \\aql, \\cen, \\source{4U}{1608}{-522}, and\n\\source{4U}{2129}{+47} with realistic \\Hyd\\ (or \\He) atmosphere\nspectra and found that the emission could be explained as thermal\nemission from an area of radius $\\approx 10\\usp\\km$.  Further\n\\chandra\\ observations of \\cen\\ \\citep{rutledge.ea.01a:cen}, \\aql\\\n\\citep{rutledge.ea.01b:aqlx1}, and \\source{KS}{1731}{-260}\n\\citep{wijnands:ks1731,rutledge.ea.01:ks1731}, as well as quiescent\ntransient neutron star identifications in $\\omega$~Cen\n\\citep{rutledge.ea:NGC5139}, NGC~6440 \\citep{pooley.ea:NGC6440}, and\n47~Tuc X5 and X7 \\citep{heinke02:47Tuc-Lq} confirm that the quiescent\nspectra of neutron star transients is consistent with being thermal\nemission (effective temperature $\\kB\\Te\\gtrsim 100\\usp\\eV$) from a\n\\Hyd\\ photosphere, plus, in most cases, an additional hard power-law\ncomponent.  The origin of the power-law tail remains uncertain (for a\nreview of proposed mechanisms, see \\citealt{campana98b}; also see\n\\citealt{menou.mcclintock:quiescent-emission}).\n\nThe second puzzle is the source of the observed variability in the\nquiescent emission on timescales $> \\unit{1}{d}$.  Indeed, it was in\npart because of an apparent \\emph{increase} in the quiescent intensity\nof \\cen\\ between 1980 (\\einstein) and 1984 (\\exosat) that led\n\\citet{vanparadijs87} to discount the possibility that the observed\nemission was intrinsic to the neutron star, i.e., not powered by\naccretion.  \\rosat/HRI observations of \\cen\\ \\citep{campana97} revealed\nthat the intensity decreased by a factor of $\\approx 3$ over 4 days.\nSimilarly, there was a fractional decrease of 40\\usp\\% in the observed\nintensity between an \\asca\\ observation and one 5\\usp\\yr\\ later with\n\\chandra, although this could be attributed to variability in the\npower-law component only \\citep{rutledge.ea.01a:cen}.  A comparison of\n\\aql\\ observations taken with \\chandra/ACIS-S, \\rosat/PSPC, and \\asca\\\n\\citep{rutledge.ea.01b:aqlx1} indicates variability by a factor of 2\nover a timescale of roughly 8\\usp\\yr.  Note that in this case there were\nseveral intervening outbursts between the different observations.  In\nboth cases, there was no short-timescale ($\\lesssim 10^{4}\\usp\\second$)\nvariability detected \\citep{rutledge.ea.01a:cen,rutledge.ea.01b:aqlx1}.\nMore recently, \\citet{rutledge.bildsten.ea:intensity} used the\n\\chandra/ACIS-S to take four ``snapshots'' of \\aql\\ after a recent\noutburst.  The intensity was observed to decrease by a factor $\\approx\n0.5$ over 3 months and then increase by a factor $\\approx 1.4$ over 1\nmonth.  In addition, short-timescale variability was found in the last\nobservation.\n\nThe standard interpretation is that the observed variability is caused\nby fluctuations in the quiescent accretion rate\n\\citep{vanparadijs87,campana97,brown98:transients,rutledge.ea.01a:cen,\nrutledge.ea.01b:aqlx1,menou.mcclintock:quiescent-emission,dubus.ea:DIM-SXT}.\n In this manuscript, we describe a previously overlooked cause of\nvariability in the intrinsic quiescent thermal emission: a changing\nenvelope\\footnote{In this paper ``envelope'' means the outermost layer\nof the neutron star where the thermal gradient is significant.  This\nis distinct from the photosphere, where the emergent continuum\nspectrum forms.} composition.  Even if accretion completely halts in\nquiescence, the neutron star's envelope will have a different\nstratification following each outburst.  This varying composition can\nchange the quiescent flux by a factor of 2 to 3 for a fixed crust/core\ntemperature.\n\nPrevious calculations of the thermal structure of a cooling unmagnetized\nneutron star considered the difference between a purely \\Fe\\ envelope\n\\citep{gudmundsson83} and one composed of light elements (\\Hyd, \\He, and\n\\C) overlying \\Fe\\ \\citep{potekhin97}.  Consider two hypothetical\nneutron stars each with a core/crust temperature of $\\Tb = 10^{8}\\usp\\K$\n(typical of neutron star SXT's; see below); one star has a pure \\Fe\\\nenvelope and the other has \\Hyd\\ and \\He\\ at densities $<\n10^{5}\\usp\\grampercc$.  As noticed by \\citet{potekhin97}, the large\ndifference in opacity between a pure iron and a light element envelope\nmeans that the effective temperature, $\\Te$, for the light element\nenvelope is a factor of 1.6 hotter: $\\Te(\\Fe) = 1.1\\ee{6}\\usp\\K$ and\n$\\Te(\\mbox{light element}) = 1.8\\ee{6}\\usp\\K$.  \\citet{gudmundsson83}\nfirst noticed that the thermal stratification is sensitive to the\nopacity in the region where the electrons are semi-degenerate.\nCoincidentally, it is in this region that the accreted \\Hyd\\ and \\He\\\nunstably ignite.  As a result the thermal gradient through the envelope\ndepends on the mass of \\Hyd\\ and \\He\\ remaining after the\n\\emph{previous} accretion outburst.  Our calculation thus addresses\nvariations in the quiescent flux from one quiescent epoch to the next,\nas the intervening outburst changes the composition and mass of the\noutermost layers of the neutron star.  Changes in the quiescent\nintensity over a timescale of months can also occur from differential\nsedimentation of ions and residual accretion.  Neither of these\nscenarios can explain short timescale ($<10^4\\usp\\second$) variability\nsuch as just observed from \\aql\\ \\citep{rutledge.bildsten.ea:intensity}.\n\nThis paper first (\\S~\\ref{sec:how-it-works}) describes in qualitative\nterms the overall stratification of a quiescent neutron star transient.\nSection~\\ref{sec:microphysics} contains a summary of the relevant\nmicrophysics in the calculation: the equation of state (EOS), diffusive\nsedimentation of ions, and thermal transport.  In \\S~\\ref{sec:example}\nwe describe how changing the composition and stratification of the\nenvelope produces variations in the surface effective temperature.  This\ncalculation is then applied, in \\S~\\ref{sec:variation}, to \\aql, \\cen,\nand \\sax.  Implications and directions for future study are discussed in\n\\S~\\ref{sec:summary}."

Estimates of the\npolarization degree are complicated by the fact that it must always be\npositive, introducing a bias into any estimate.

        "question": "What is the relationship between radio and X-ray emission in individual microquasars, and does this relationship vary across different sources or spectral states?",
        "introduction": "Microquasars are inherently broadband objects, like active galactic nuclei and gamma-ray\nbursts. Roughly speaking, the spectral energy distribution (SED) of microquasars can be\ndivided into three main regimes (see review by, e.g., Liang 1998): a power-law distribution\nat radio frequencies, which could extend up to infrared/optical regions (e.g., Chaty et \nal. 2003), a blackbody-like profile in the middle (from optical to soft X-ray frequencies), \nand a power-law distribution again at hard X-ray/soft gamma-ray energies (which eventually \nrolls over). To interpret the SED of microquasars, two classes of models have been \nproposed, with one being accretion-based (e.g., Esin et al. 2001) and the other jet-based \n(Markoff et al. 2001, 2003). However, neither class of models can satisfactorily explain \nthe {\\it overall} SED of microquasars. The accretion-based models typically fail at low \nfrequencies (radio and infrared in particular; see discussion in Yuan, Cui, \\& Narayan \n2005), while the jet-based models suffer from a number of issues (Zdziarski et al. 2003). \nA hybrid scenario seems more likely (and natural), in which both the accretion flows and \njets make critical contributions to the SED of microquasars but the relative importance of \nthe contributions may vary at different frequencies. For example, the coupled accretion-jet \nmodel proposed by Yuan et al. (2005) postulates that the radio (and a bulk of infrared) \nemission comes entirely from the jets and the X-ray (and soft gamma-ray) emission is due \nalmost entirely to the accretion flows. An effective way to assess the roles of the jets \nand accretion flows in microquasars is, therefore, to study the broadband SED of these \nsystems. \n\nA key ingredient in nearly all models on jet formation is the physical coupling between\nthe jets and accretion flows (e.g., Falcke \\& Biermann 1995; Meier 2001). For microquasars, \nsuch a jet-accretion coupling might manifest itself in the correlated radio and X-ray \nvariabilities (Robertson \\& Leiter 2004; Yuan \\& Cui 2005). Indeed, a positive radio/X-ray \ncorrelation was first\nestablished for GX 339--4 in the low-hard state (Corbel et al. 2003). A similar correlation \nwas subsequently also seen in V404 Cyg (also in the low-hard state), which led to the \nclaim that the correlation is the same for all microquasars (Gallo et al. 2003). If proven, \nsuch a universal radio/X-ray correlation would have profound implications on theoretical \nmodels (e.g., Heinz 2004; Robertson \\& Leiter 2004; Yuan \\& Cui 2005). However, as noted by \nXue et al. (2006), the data shown by Gallo et al. (2003) are dominated \nby only two sources (GX 339--4 and V404 Cyg); the data points for other sources are very \nlimited in their dynamical ranges yet already show significant deviations from the universal \ncorrelation. Subsequent studies provided additional evidence for such deviations (see, e.g., \nFig.~5 in Choudhury et al. 2003 and Fig.~17 in Wilms et al. 2006), even for the low-hard \nstate, although the authors tended to be dismissive of the discrepancies. Based on these and \nother observations, Xue et al. (2006) suggested that, while the radio and X-ray variabilities \ncould well be correlated among microquasars individually, the correlation might not be \nquantitatively the same for all.\n\nTo resolve this important issue, we have undertaken an effort to systematically examine\nthe simultaneous radio and X-ray data already taken for a representative sample of \nmicroquasars. We believe that the best way to separate personality from universality is \nto carefully examine the radio/X-ray correlation on a source by source basis. We have\nalso taken the opportunity to examine the radio/X-ray correlation beyond the low-hard \nstate, to the extent that the data allow."

        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\nSeveral observations made over the recent years, related to a large extension \nto Large Scale Structures (LSS) and\nanisotropies of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB)\nas well as the magnitude--redshift relation for type Ia Supernovae  \nhave given us a convincing picture of the energy and matter density in\nthe Universe \\citep{per99,rie98,spe03,teg04,lar10}.\n\nBaryonic matter accounts for no more than 30$\\%$ of the mass in galaxy \nclusters while the existence of a large clustered component of \nDark Matter (DM) seems now firmly established, although its nature is \nstill unknown.\nHowever, they \ncontribute to the total energy density of the Universe with\nonly a few percent and about 25$\\%$ respectively.\n\nNo more than another few percent could be accounted for by massive neutrinos,\nbut only in the most favorable, but unlikely case. According to \\citet{kri07}\n(see also \\citet{elg02}) \nthe total mass of neutrinos cannot exceed the limit of 1.43 $eV$ \n(see, however,\n\\citet{lav09a,lav09b,kri10} for a recent analysis\non neutrino mass limits in coupled dark energy models). \nA very small part $(10^{-4})$ of the total energy density is due to massless\nneutrinos and CMB radiation. \n\nThe model suggested by observations is only viable if the remaining 75$\\%$\nis ascribed to the so--called Dark Energy (DE) responsible for the present\nday cosmic acceleration. \n\nAlthough strongly indicated by the observations, the existence of DE is\n even more \npuzzling than DM. It can be identified with a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$\nor with a yet unknown dynamical component with negative pressure. \nOn the other hand, its manifestation can be interpreted as a geometrical\nproperty of the gravity on large scales resulting from a failure of \nGeneral Relativity (GR) on those scales (see \\citet{cop06} for \na review). \n   \nWithin the context of GR, as an alternative to the cosmological constant,\nDE is usually described as a scalar field $\\phi$, \nself--interacting through a suitable potential $V(\\phi)$, or a cosmic fluid\nwith negative pressure \\citet{pee03} (see \\citet{koi1,koi2,li} for alternatives and references therein).\n\nScalar fields naturally arise in particle physics. Furthermore,\nif they are {\\it\ntracker} fields \\citep{ste99}, {\\it fine tunings} associated to the small value of the\npresent DE energy density can be significantly alleviated unlike \nthe cosmological constant case. \n\nIn addition to self--interaction, a scalar field can in principle be \ncoupled to any other field present in nature. \nHowever, in order to drive the cosmic acceleration, \nits present time mass is expected to be, at least on large scales,  \n$m_\\phi \\sim H_0 \\sim 10^{-33} eV$ ($H_0$ being the present Hubble parameter).\nSuch a tiny mass gives rise to long--range interactions which could be tested\nwith fifth--force type experiments. \nCouplings to ordinary particles are strongly constrained by such a kind of \nexperiments but limits on the DM coupling are looser (constraints on coupling\nfor specific models were obtained in \n\\citet{mac04,ame03,oli05,lee06,guo07,mai07} from CMB,\nN-body simulations and matter power spectrum analysis).\n\nA possible common origin of DM and DE and/or a their direct coupling\n\\citep{wet95,ame99,gas02,bar00,chi03,rho03,far04}.\nwould ease one of the most critical problems in modern cosmology, \nthe so--called {\\it coincidence problem}:\nwhy expansion started to accelerate just at the eve of our cosmic epoch, \nafter decelerating during all epochs after inflation? Why DE and DM have\nsimilar densities just now?\nBecause of the coupling DM and DE densities keep similar \nvalues during a long period and the only peculiar feature of the present epoch\nis the recent overtaking of DM density by DE density.\n  \nIf present, DM--DE coupling could have a relevant role in \nthe cosmological evolution affecting not only the overall cosmic expansion\nbut also modifying the DM particles dynamics with  relevant\nconsequences on the growth of the matter density perturbations in both\nlinear and nonlinear regime (e.g., on halo density profiles, \ncluster mass function and its evolution, see\n\\citet{wan98,mai03a,mai03b,kly03,dol04,mac04,per04,mot04,oli06,nun05,motv04,\nmao05,nun05,wan06,man06,nun06,dut07,mot07,mai08,sha08,mot08,mai09,bal09,win10,bal10}.\nLSS is then a powerful probe of DE nature which permit to put \nsignificant constraints on DE parameters. Constraints often become even more\nstringent when data from other probes are simultaneously taken into account.\n\nCMB is another powerful probe of DE nature. \nIn principle, by joining anisotropy \nand polarization data, DE parameters can be significantly constrained.\nCMB and LSS probe the universe at different epochs and are therefore \ncomplementary to each other. Future data from high resolution CMB experiment\nlike PLANCK \\footnote{http://www.rssd.esa.int/index.php?project=planck} and \nLSS surveys (EUCLID \\footnote{http://www.euclid-imaging.net/}, LSST \n\\footnote{http://www.lsst.org/lsst}, \nDES \\footnote{https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/}, \nJDEM \\footnote{http://jdem.gsfc.nasa.gov/}, etc)  will allow to \nconstrain DE up to an unprecedented accuracy.\n\nIn this paper we will focus on the Integrated Sachs Wolfe (ISW) effect \n\\citep{sac67}.\nISW effect\nis a secondary anisotropy of the CMB and a direct signature of DE. \nThe effect arises when a photon from the last scattering surface passes\nthrough a \ntime--dependent gravitational potential changing its energy so that additional\ntemperature anisotropies are generated. \nDecay of gravitational potentials may occur through cosmic curvature, \nin the presence of DE or in alternative gravity models.\n\nAssuming General Relativity is the correct theory of gravity and \nthat the Universe is spatially flat,\nlarge--scale gravitational potentials do not evolve\nsignificantly in the matter era. Cosmic acceleration, however, causes the \ngravitational potentials to decay making the ISW effect highly sensitive to\nthe presence of DE.\n\nThough difficult to detect directly in the CMB,\nISW signal can be measured by cross--correlating the CMB with \ntracers of LSS and has recently been detected using WMAP data of CMB in \ncombination with several LSS surveys at the \nthe $\\sim 3-4 \\sigma$ confidence level providing\nindependent evidence for the existence of the DE (see \\citet{gia08a,xia09}\nand references therein).\n\nCross-correlation then \nprovides a powerful method to discriminate among different DE models and,\nin particular, to detect a possible interaction between DE and DM other than\ninvestigate the clustering properties of DE on large scales.\nIf present, DM--DE coupling changes  both the \nscaling of the DM energy density and the growth rate of matter perturbations \nyielding a significant evolution of the metric potentials even \nin the matter era.\n\n\nThe aim of this paper is to provide an exhaustive analysis of the ISW \neffect in the contest of the {\\it so called} coupled DE cosmologies \n\\citep{ame00} mainly \nfocusing on the effects of the DM--DE coupling on the cross--correlation \nbetween galaxy/quasar distributions and ISW effect.\n  \nSuch models can be motivated in the contest of scalar--tensor theories of \ngravity or describe the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory beyond\nthe standard model of particle physics, e.g. string theory.\n\nThe models which we aim to investigate differ from the standard \n$\\Lambda$CDM in three different\naspects: (i) {DE is a self--interacting scalar field $\\phi$ rather\nthan a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$. We shall consider a class of \nself--interaction potentials $V(\\phi)$\nadmitting {\\it tracker solutions}}. (ii) {A linear DM--DE coupling is\nallowed.} (iii) {We allow neutrinos to be massive.}\n\nThe effects of massive neutrinos in cosmology have been studied\nthoroughly for many years (for a review see \\citet{les06}). Cosmological\n observations are mostly\nsensitive to the sum of neutrino masses, $M_\\nu$. Currently, the strongest \nupper limit on neutrino mass scale comes from cosmology.\nOne of the effects of massive neutrinos is to induce a small \ndecay of the gravitational \npotentials during both matter and DE domination so that, in principle, \nISW effect would also provide information on their mass.\nFurthermore, as recently outlined in \\citet{lav09a,lav09b,kri10} the effects\nthat massive neutrinos have on the angular power spectrum of the CMB \nanisotropies, $C_l$, and \nmatter power spectrum, $P(k)$, are almost opposite to\nthose of the DM--DE coupling, resulting in \na strong degeneracy between the coupling strength $\\beta$ and $M_\\nu$. \nA recent analysis by means of Monte Carlo Markov Chain method has shown that a \ncosmology with significant $M_\\nu$ and $\\beta$ is statistically \npreferred to one with no coupling and almost massless neutrinos. Further,\nwhen priors on the neutrino mass from\nearth-based neutrino mass experiments (Heidelberg-Moscow neutrinoless\ndouble $\\beta$-decay, KATRIN \n tritium $\\beta$-decay \\footnote{http://www-ik.fzk.de/katrin/publications/documents/Design Report2004-12Jan2005.pdf}) are added to the analysis,\na $5-6 \\sigma$ detection of a DM-DE coupling is found.\n\nThe plan of the paper is as follows: in Section 2 we describe our model\nwhile the ISW effect theory is reviewed in Section 3 where we also discuss\nhow the ISW signal depends on the main parameters of the model.\nIn Section 4 we discuss galaxy bias and magnification bias. Comparison between\ntheoretical prediction and observation data is presented in Section 5 while\na tomographic analysis is performed in Section 6. Section 7 is devoted to the conclusions."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the orbital period and the mass of helium white dwarf companions in binary millisecond pulsar systems?",
        "introduction": "The majority of binary millisecond pulsars (MSPs) orbit low-mass helium white-dwarf companions \\citep[He\\,WDs; see data in][]{mhth05}. The \nstandard formation channel for these systems requires mass transfer from a low-mass donor ($m_{\\rm donor} \\lesssim \n2$\\,M$_{\\odot}$) onto an old neutron star (NS) during a long-lived, low-mass {X}-ray binary (LMXB) phase. Throughout the mass-transfer \nepisode, the NS gains mass and spin angular momentum, and tidal forces acting on the donor wipe out any \nprimordial eccentricity imparted on the system during the supernova explosion \\citep[see, e.g.,][]{bvh91}.  \n\nLMXBs with relatively wide initial separations  initiate mass transfer as the donor  undergoes hydrogen-shell burning on the red giant branch. Such systems evolve toward orbital periods between $\\sim 2$ and $\\sim 150$ days \\citep{tv06} and follow two distinct relations.  \n(1) the remnant companions are He\\,WDs with masses that scale with orbital period, because the progenitor's core mass depends on the stellar radius which is set by the orbital separation \\citep[e.g.,][]{sav87,ts99a}; (2) the residual eccentricity correlates with the orbital period  because turbulent density fluctuations in the donor's convective envelope prevent  perfect circularization \\citep{phi92}. \n\nIndeed, most known binary MSPs outside of globular clusters closely follow the predictions of the  \n``recycling'' scenario \\citep[based on data available in the ATNF pulsar catalog;][]{mhth05}. Until recently, the only known MSP with a substantial eccentricity was PSR\\,J1903+0327 with  $e\\simeq0.44$ \nand a main-sequence companion \\citep{crl+08}. The current \nconsensus for this binary's formation is that it is the fossil of a triple system, where the mass-losing star was ejected due to dynamical interactions \\citep[e.g.,][]{fbw+11,pzvh+11}. \n \n Interestingly, eccentric MSPs have now grown in number with the discovery of the three systems shown in Table\\,1. \n For these binaries a triple-origin scenario seems unlikely for two main\n reasons: First, the companions are  He WDs (J.~Antoniadis {\\it et al.}, in preparation) that have masses consistent with what is expected from binary evolution \\citep[e.g.][]{ts99a}. Second, their orbital periods and eccentricities seem to resemble \n each other, which is  unlikely  for systems that evolved through a chaotic dynamical process. \n\n\\cite{ft14} proposed instead that the first two MSPs in Table\\,1 may have formed directly from the rotationally delayed, accretion-induced collapse (RD-AIC) of a massive WD. In this scenario, the eccentricity grows from zero to roughly ${(m_{\\rm WD}^{\\rm progenitor} - m_{\\rm NS})}/{M}\\simeq 0.1$ during the NS formation (where $m_{\\rm WD}^{\\rm progenitor}$ is the mass of the WD progenitor, $m_{\\rm NS}$ is the NS mass after the implosion, and  $M$ is the total mass of the binary). Systems formed via an RD-AIC should host low-mass NSs \n(with a mass equal to the initial baryonic WD mass minus the gravitational binding energy) and  move with small systemic velocities, as the natal kick from the WD implosion should be minimal \\citep{kjh06,dbo+06}. \n\nHowever, recent observations show that eccentric MSPs in fact host NSs  with highly scattered masses and  systemic velocities, thereby  contradicting the RD-AIC hypothesis (J.~Antoniadis {\\it et al.}, in preparation; E. Barr \\& P. Freire, {private communication}). An explanation of these measurements within the RD-AIC scenario  would require an additional assumption of  highly differentially rotating WD progenitors and substantial natal kicks at birth \\citep{ft14}. \n\n\\begin{table}\n\\caption{Properties of Known Eccentric MSPs with Low-mass Companions}\n\\begin{center}\n\\begin{tabular}{cccc}\n\\hline\nName & Period (days) & Eccentricity &$m_{\\rm WD, median}^{\\rm a}$\\\\\n\\hline\nJ2234$+$0611$^{\\rm b}$ & 32.01 & 0.129 & 0.23\\\\\nJ1946+3417$^{\\rm c}$ & 27.01 & 0.134 & 0.24 \\\\\nJ1618$-$3919$^{\\rm d}$ & 22.80 & 0.027 & 0.20 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{tabular}\n\\end{center}\n\\begin{flushleft}\n$^{\\rm a}$Assuming a pulsar mass of $1.4$\\,M$_{\\odot}$\nand an inclination of $60^{\\rm o}$. \\\\\n$^{\\rm b}$\\cite{dsm+13}; $^{\\rm c}$\\cite{bck+13,ewan}; $^{\\rm d}$\\cite{eb01b,bai10}\n\\end{flushleft}\n\\end{table}\n\n In this Letter, I propose that high eccentricities may instead result from the dynamical interaction of the binary with a circumbinary disk (CB disk). I show that such a disk may form from material escaping the donor's surface as it undergoes  hydrogen-shell flashes,  following the LMXB phase and shortly before entering the final WD cooling branch.\nThe mass loss (of order $10^{-4}-10^{-3}$\\,M$_{\\odot}$) during flashes---occurring when the NS is already an active MSP and tidal forces can no longer affect the contracting proto-WD---can lead to a CB disk which may increase the eccentricity to the observed values within a timescale much shorter than the characteristic ages of these systems. Finally, using a Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation, I demonstrate that the CB hypothesis may explain  the lack of circular  MSPs with orbital periods between $\\sim 15$ and $\\sim 50$ days.  Within the CB disk scenario, the low end of the orbital period gap would be linked to a decreased CB disk lifetime for shorter orbital periods and the long-period cut-off would result from the cessation of hydrogen flashes for higher-mass WDs."

        "question": "What is the primary mechanism for the production of astrophysical TeV gamma-rays?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\nExploration into the nature of the very high energy (VHE, $E > 100$ GeV) $\\gamma$-ray sky has rapidly progressed with the use of Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs). Telescopes such as the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), an array of IACTs, have found many VHE $\\gamma$-ray sources along the Galactic plane \\citep{hess2005,hess_plane,2015ICRC...34..773D}. Many of the extended, Galactic sources have been associated with high-energy phenomena, such as pulsar wind nebulae (PWN), supernova remnants (SNRs) and binaries (\\citealt{2008AIPC.1085..285R,2005A&A...442....1A,2008A&A...490..685A} etc.). However, a large population of VHE sources remain unassociated, and appear to have no clear counterparts seen in other wavelengths \\citep{2015ICRC...34..773D,doi:10.1063/1.4968905}.\n\nAstrophysical TeV $\\gamma$-rays have two main mechanisms of production: the decay of neutral pions produced by the hadronic interactions between highly accelerated cosmic-ray particles and ambient interstellar medium (ISM); and the leptonic interaction of upscattering background photons via the inverse-Compton effect by high energy electrons. Understanding the distribution of the ISM towards unidentified TeV sources is thus critical in order to constrain the possible TeV $\\gamma$-ray production scenarios. Here, we focus on HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and HESS\\,J1616$-$508, two of the most prominent unidentified TeV sources detected in the first HESS Galactic Plane Survey \\citep{hess2005,hess_plane}.\n\\\\\n\nHESS\\,J1614$-$518 is a TeV $\\gamma$-ray source that was first discovered by HESS as part of a survey of the Galactic plane \\citep{hess2005}. It was the brightest of the new sources discovered in the survey, with a flux 25$\\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above 200 GeV. It has a TeV $\\gamma$-ray spectrum that is well fit by a power-law, d$N$/dE $= N_0E^{-\\Gamma}$, with a photon index $\\Gamma = 2.46 \\pm 0.21$. The TeV emission has an elliptical morphology, with semi-major and semi-minor axes of $14 \\pm 1$ and $9 \\pm 1$ arcmin respectively. It is also characterised by two peaks of emission in the Galactic North-East and Galactic South-West of the source. No immediately obvious counterpart to this source appeared in other wavelengths, and HESS\\,J1614$-$518 was considered a ``dark-accelerator\".\n\nRecent preliminary results from HESS, following a systematic search for new TeV-emitting SNRs, suggest that HESS\\,J1614$-$518 may have a shell-like TeV $\\gamma$-ray morphology \\citep{doi:10.1063/1.4968934}. As no evidence of an associated SNR has been seen so far in other wavelengths, HESS\\,J1614$-$518 is currently considered a SNR candidate.\n\nObservations towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 in X-rays made by \\emph{Suzaku} revealed three X-ray sources within the TeV $\\gamma$-ray source \\citep{2008PASJ...60S.163M}. The first source, Suzaku Src A, is extended and is located close (within $\\sim 8$ arcmin) to the brightest TeV peak of HESS\\,J1614$-$518. The 2nd X-ray source, Suzaku Src B, is located towards the centre of HESS\\,J1614$-$518. Additional \\emph{Suzaku} observations and analysis of \\emph{XMM-Newton} archival data revealed that Suzaku Src B was comprised of several point sources \\citep{2011PASJ...63S.879S}. The brightest of these, XMM-Newton source B1, had the largest count rate by a factor $\\sim 5$, and indicated that it was the main object of Suzaku Src B. \\cite{2011PASJ...63S.879S} postulated that HESS\\,J1614$-$518 could be an SNR associated with an Anomalous X-ray Pulsar (AXP). This scenario has XMM-Newton source B1 as the AXP produced by a supernova explosion, and Suzaku source A as the shocked region of the SNR. The other X-ray source found by \\emph{Suzaku}, Suzaku source C, was found to be a late-type B star \\citep{2008PASJ...60S.163M}.\n\nThe X-ray telescope (XRT) aboard \\emph{Swift} observed the region towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and found six point-like X-ray sources \\citep{2007ATel.1047....1L}. Four of these (Swift sources 1, 2, 3 and 5 in \\citealt{2007ATel.1047....1L})  were identified as stars, while the others (Swift sources 4 and 6) remain unidentified. The Swift source 1 and 4 are coincident with Suzaku source B and C respectively. Suzaku source A was not seen by the \\emph{Swift} XRT in these observations.\n\nA GeV source is seen towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 by the \\emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (\\emph{Fermi}-LAT). Designated 3FGL\\,J1615.3$-$5146e in the 3rd Fermi point source catalogue \\citep{2015ApJS..218...23A}, the extended source was classified as being `disk-like', and has a relative large diameter of $\\sim 0.8^{\\circ}$ which covers a major fraction of HESS\\,J1614$-$518.\n\nSeveral H\\textsc{ii} regions and molecular cloud complexes appear to the Galactic-North of HESS\\,J1614$-$518. Figure \\ref{fig:spitzer_hi} is a \\textit{Spitzer} GLIMPSE 8.0 $\\mu$m image \\citep{2009PASP..121..213C} of the region towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and the neighbouring TeV source HESS\\,J1616$-$508, with nearby H\\textsc{ii} regions labelled in yellow. While there are several H\\textsc{ii} regions in the vicinity of HESS\\,J1614$-$518, none appear to overlap the TeV source.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!ht]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[width=\\linewidth]{spitzer_hii_image.pdf}\n\\caption[what]{\\textit{Spitzer} GLIMPSE 8.0 $\\mu$m image [MJy\\,sr$^{-1}$]  towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and HESS\\,J1616$-$508 \\citep{2009PASP..121..213C}.

The known pulsars towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518 were thought likely not responsible for the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission due to their insufficient spin-down powers, though a small fractional contribution could not be ruled out. A possible association between HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and the young open stellar cluster Pismis 22 \\citep{Piatti} was suggested in scenarios where stellar winds from several B-type stars or undetected SNRs from deceased members of the cluster would accelerate cosmic-rays that would interact with ambient gas to produce $\\gamma$-rays hadronically. \n\n\\cite{2011ApJ...740...78M} used the CANGAROO-III telescopes to study the TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission towards HESS\\,J1614$-$518, and also investigated the plausibility of several radiation mechanisms. A leptonic scenario based on an undetected SNR was rejected as it was not able to reproduce the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) in $\\gamma$-rays. On the other hand, hadronic models that involved either a SNR or stellar winds from Pismis 22 were found to produce a good reproduction of the SED. Certain requirements, however, on the number density of the ISM were needed, and the initial investigation of the Nanten $^{12}$CO(1$-$0) survey data by \\cite{2008AIPC.1085..241R} in this region had revealed no obvious overlapping molecular clouds along the line of sight up to a kinematic distance of $\\sim 6$\\,kpc. More detailed and higher resolution ISM data were needed in order to test the validity of these models.\n\\\\\n\n\n\\textit{HESS\\,J1616$-$508} is located less than a degree away from HESS\\,J1614$-$518. It too was discovered as part of the HESS Galactic plane survey \\citep{hess2005}, with a $\\gamma$-ray flux 19$\\%$ that of the Crab Nebula above 200 GeV. The TeV spectrum is fit by a power-law model with a photon index $\\Gamma = 2.35\\pm0.06$. It has a roughly circular extended morphology, with an angular diameter of $\\sim16$ arcmin. There are two SNRs near HESS\\,J1616$-$508, Kes 32 (G332.4+0.1) and RCW 103 (G332.4$-$0.4), located 17 and 13 arcmin away respectively. Due to the distance from the centre of HESS\\,J1616$-$508, an association between the TeV source and either SNR has been disfavoured \\citep{Landi2007,Kargaltsev2008}.\n\nThree pulsars are seen towards the vicinity of HESS\\,J1616$-$508. Two of them, PSR J1616$-$5109 and PSR J1614$-$5048 are unlikely to be associated with the TeV emission due to their large separation from HESS\\,J1616$-$508. On the other hand, the young ($\\sim 8$ kyr) pulsar PSR\\,J1617$-$5055 \\citep{Kaspi1998} and associated pulsar wind nebula (PWN) have been suggested as candidate objects responsible for the TeV emission \\citep{Landi2007,Aharonian2008,2011ICRC....6..202T,2013ApJ...773...77A}. PSR J1617$-$5055 has a spin-down power sufficient to supply the appropriate energetics, but is offset from the centre of the TeV source by $\\sim 9$ arcmin. Observations in X-rays by \\emph{Chandra} revealed a faint PWN extending from PSR J1617$-$5055 \\citep{Kargaltsev2008}. However, PWNs associated with offset TeV $\\gamma$-ray emission typically have an extension of the X-ray emission towards said $\\gamma$-rays, and the \\emph{Chandra} observations found no evidence of any X-ray asymmetry in the PWN towards HESS\\,J1616$-$508. Recent analysis of three \\emph{Chandra} observations covering most of HESS\\,J1616$-$508 was performed by \\cite{2017ApJ...841...81H}, finding 56 X-rays sources within the fields. Many of the sources were identified as active galactic nuclei (AGN) and non-degenerate stars, but none were found to be promising counterparts to the TeV source.\n\nObservations by \\emph{Fermi}-LAT reveal a GeV $\\gamma-$ray source, 3FGL\\,J1616.2$-$5054e towards HESS\\,J1616$-$508 \\citep{2015ApJS..218...23A}. It has a diameter of $\\sim0.6^{\\circ}$ and is positionally coincident with the TeV source.\n\nA number of  H\\textsc{ii} regions are seen towards HESS\\,J1616$-$508, with several overlapping the TeV source as shown in Figure\\,\\ref{fig:spitzer_hi}.\n\\\\\n\nTo better understand the origins of HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and HESS\\,J1616$-$508, a detailed understanding of the distribution and characteristics of the ISM towards these two sources is required. In order to achieve this, we have used molecular line data taken by the Mopra radio telescope and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). The diffuse ($\\overline{n}\\gtrsim10^3$ cm$^{-3}$) gas towards the two TeV sources were traced as part of the Mopra Southern Galactic Plane CO Survey \\citep{2013PASA...30...44B}. Data were taken from the \\mbox{Millimetre Astronomer's Legacy Team - 45 GHz} (MALT-45) survey \\citep{Jordan2015} which targeted the dense ($\\overline{n}\\gtrsim10^4$ cm$^{-3}$) gas tracers in the 7\\,mm wavelength band including CS(1$-$0) and SiO(1$-$0, v=0). As the MALT-45 survey did not extend to encompass HESS\\,J1614$-$518 entirely, we took further observations in the 7\\,mm wavelength band with Mopra to complete the coverage in the dense gas tracers.\n\nSection 2 describes the parameters and reduction process involved with the data taken with the Mopra radio telescope, as well as the parameters of the data taken from the MALT-45 survey. Section 3 describes the gas parameter calculations that we apply to the data. In Section 4, we present our findings of the the distribution of the ISM towards the TeV sources. Finally, in Section 5, we discuss our results and the implications they have on the possible production scenarios for HESS\\,J1614$-$518 and HESS\\,J1616$-$508."

While C$_{nTh1}$ and C$_{Th}$ seem to be present in most GRBs, C$_{nTh2}$ has only been detected in a few cases; it is not clear if this component is absent in most GRBs or if it is too weak to be detected. Reanalysis of GRB archival data collected with the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the {\\it Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory} ({\\it CGRO}) confirmed that C$_{nTh1}$+C$_{Th}$+C$_{nTh2}$ is a good model for $\\gamma$-ray prompt emission~\\citep{Guiriec:2016a}. Using optical, X- and $\\gamma$-ray data collected with the three instruments on board {\\it Swift} and {\\it Suzaku}/Wide-band All-sky Monitor (WAM),~\\cite{Guiriec:2016b} showed that C$_{nTh1}$+C$_{Th}$+C$_{nTh2}$ constitutes a unified model for the whole GRB broadband prompt emission, from the optical regime to higher energy $\\gamma$-rays. Identification of the individual components of the prompt emission is a crucial step for disentangling the physical processes powering GRB jets.\n\nDiscovered in a long GRB~\\citep{Guiriec:2011}, C$_{Th}$ has now been identified in an increasing number of both short and long GRBs. Although typically subdominant, compared to C$_{nTh1}$, C$_{Th}$ is particularly intense in GRB~120323A, a short and bright GRB, which triggered both the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on board {\\it Fermi} and the Konus instrument on board the {\\it Wind} satellite\\footnote{For a catalog of short GRBs observed with Konus, see \\citet{Svinkin:2016}}.\nThis burst provides, therefore, a unique opportunity to compare and contrast the analysis of the data collected with these two instruments, which operate in similar energy bands.% Such joint analysis of GRBs will \n\n\n\n\n\n%Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) are difficult objects to observe. Not only they occur randomly in the sky, but they are also very short duration events with their prompt emission lasting from few ms to few tens of seconds. However, during this short period of time, GRBs are brighter than all the other sources in the Universe and the $\\sim$10$^\\mathrm{52}$ erg.s$^\\mathrm{-1}$ released by the central engine are mostly observed in the keV-MeV energy range. Therefore, whole-sky monitors are ideal instruments to observe large number of GRBs, but they usually suffer from high background level sometimes difficult to model as well as poor localization capabilities, which can impact the quality of the instrument responses required to perform accurate spectral analysis.\n\n%While the origin of GRBs is still debated, GRB central engines are usually consider to be stellar mass black holes resulting either from the collapse of hyper-massive stars~\\citep[i.e., collapsar scenario --][]{Woosley:1993,MacFadyen:1999,Woosley:2006}, or the merger of two compact objects such as two neutron stars~\\citep{Paczynski:1986,Fryer:1999,Rosswog:2003}. Whatever is the origin of the central engine, the most popular scenario to explain GRB emission is the so-called fireball model~\\citep{Cavallo:1978}. In this model, the central engine releases a bipolar and collimated relativistic jet mainly composed of photons, electrons, positrons and a small amount of baryons. The wind propagating within the jet is inhomogeneous and can be assimilated to solid layers probating at various velocities. When the fastest layers catch up with the slowest ones, charged particles contained in the shock region are accelerated by collision-less shocks, called internal shocks \\citep[IS --][]{Rees:1994,Kobayashi:1997,Daigne:1998}, and radiate a non-thermal emission through synchrotron, synchrotron self Compton (SSC) and inverse Compton (IC) processes, among others. This emission would mostly account for the short lived GRB prompt phase observed in the keV-MeV energy range \\citep{Gruber:2014}. The fireball model also predicts a photospheric emission~\\citep{Goodman:1986,Daigne:2002,Meszaros:2002,Rees:2005,Nakar:2005,Hascoet:2013}. Indeed, the particles contained in the wind initially optically thick to Thomson scattering are in thermal equilibrium with the radiation field. As the jet expands, it becomes optically thin and a thermal-like component more or less affected by sub-photospheric phenomena should be detected simultaneously with the non-thermal prompt emission.\n\n%Prompt emission spectra of Gamma-Ray Burst in the keV-MeV energy range are usually adequately fitted with the so-called Band function~\\citep{Band:1993}. This empirical function is a smoothly broken power law (PL) characterized with four parameters: two indices $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ for the low and the high energy PLs, respectively, E$_\\mathrm{peak}$ corresponding to the energy at the maximum of the $\\nu$F$_\\nu$ spectrum~\\citep{Gehrels:1997} when $\\alpha>$-2 and $\\beta<$-2, and a normalization factor. Although the Band function is an empirical model, it is usually associated to synchrotron radiations emitted by electrons propagating within the jet and accelerated through the IS. However, the high values for $\\alpha$ are very often inconsistent with the predictions of this emission process in both the electron slow and fast cooling regimes~\\citep{Crider:1997,xxx}. Other models suggest that the observed $\\gamma$-ray emission corresponds to a strongly reprocessed jet photospheric emission~\\ref{xxx}.\n\n%Prior to the launch of the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope (later Fermi) in 2008, only a limited number of GRB prompt emission spectra---mainly observed with the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO)---exhibited significant deviations from the Band function. \\citet{Gonzalez:2003} reported that the time-resolved prompt emission spectra of GRB~$941017$ observed simultaneously with the Burst And Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) and the Energetic Gamma-Ray Experiment Telescope (EGRET) on board CGRO were best fitted with the combination of a Band function and an additional PL. \\citet{Ghirlanda:2003} and \\citet{Ryde:2004} showed that some GRB prompt emission spectra observed with BATSE were adequately fitted with a black body (BB) component for the former or the combination of a BB and a PL for the later. However, due to the limited energy range of BATSE it was difficult to assess clearly if thermal or non-thermal shapes were the best description of the spectra.\n\n%With Fermi, we entered a new Era. Observation of prompt emission spectra with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) alone or in combination with the Large Area Telescope (LAT) confirmed the need for an additional PL to the Band function in several GRBs making possible detailed studies of this spectral feature on a larger sample of bursts~\\citep{Abdo:2009:GRB090902B,Guiriec:2010,Ackermann:2010:GRB090510,Ackermann:2011:GRB090926A}. For the first time,~\\citet{Guiriec:2011a} reported fits of GRB 100724B prompt emission spectra with a combination of a Band function and a BB component making possible the simultaneous and clear identification of a thermal and a non-thermal contribution. This subdominant thermal-like component were associated to the photospheric emission predicted for a long time by the fireball model. Since this first observation, similar results have been reported in multiple GRBs observed with Fermi~\\citep[e.g.,][]{Guiriec:2010,Guiriec:2011a,Guiriec:2013,Guiriec:2014,Guiriec:2015a,Guiriec:2015b,Guiriec:2016a,Guiriec:2016b}, but also with BATSE~\\ref{Guiriec:2016a}, and Swift and Suzaku~\\ref{Guiriec:2016b}. Interestingly, when fitted in combination with a BB component, the shape of the Band function becomes more compatible with what is expected from the synchrotron emission scenarios with steeper slopes for the low energy PLs and E$_\\mathrm{peak}$ shifted towards higher energy. We attribute this ability of GBM to identify clearly such spectral features to its broad energy range compared to other instruments as well as to the data format which makes possible spectral analysis down to the ms time-scale~\\citep{Guiriec:2010} and a good modeling of the background.\n\n%However, such a subdominant BB component in addition to the Band function has only been reported in the Fermi data until now, and it raised some concerns about possible calibration effects. \n\n%Fortunately,\n\n%Several whole-sky monitors sensitive in the keV-MeV energy range are flying together and several GRBs are bright enough to be analyzed properly with multiple instruments. It is the case of the very intense short GRB~$120323$A, which triggered simultaneously GBM and the instrument Konus on board the WIND satellite. Fermi observation of GRB~$120323$A have been reported in details in~\\citet{Guiriec:2013} and the adequate fit to the spectra with a combination of a Band function and a BB component has been suggested for the first time in a short GRB. In the following, we propose to compare the results reported for~\\grb using the Fermi data with Konus ones. The goal of this article is not to definitely prove the trueness of a model but rather to assess the consistency of the GBM and Konus data for~\\grb as well as the consistency of the conclusions resulting from the spectral analysis obtained by fitting separately or simultaneously the two instrument data sets.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[totalheight=0.55\\textheight]{./figure1.pdf}\n\n\\caption{\\label{fig1}GBM and Konus light curves of~\\grb with 2 ms time resolution (left and right respectively) after accounting for light propagation between the two spacecrafts; Konus trigger time, T$_0$, is used as the time reference.

        "question": "What is the typical power-law index for the decay of peak energy (Ep) during the decay phase of gamma-ray burst pulses?",
        "introduction": "The origin of the gamma-ray burst (GRB) still remains unclear though\nit has been found for more than forty years and many progresses have\nbeen made. The best probe of early phase of jet attributes and the\nphysical mechanism is the prompt emission, essentially the\ntemporal-spectral dependence of GRB pulses due to the absence of\nsome other ways to detect them, such as gravitational wave and\nneutrino detections. The analysis of the GRB prompt emission\nprovides us valuable clues to the environment from which the\nradiation emits and the underlying processes giving rise to the\nphenomenon.\n%The spectra and temporal structures of GRBs are very\n%complex. Accurate study of individual pulse behavior is often\n%difficult, since the pulses of most bright bursts tend to overlap.\nThe spectral evolution is universal and has been studied both over\nthe entire burst, giving the overall behavior and over individual\npulse structures (see, for instance, the review by Ryde 1999).\nPulses are common features in a GRB light curve and appear to be the\nfundamental constituent of it (see, e.g., Norris et al. 1996; Stern\n\\& Svensson 1996). This single pulse temporal evolution is often\nbeen described by a fast rise and exponential decay (the so-called\nFRED shape, see Fishman et al. 1994). The spectral hardness\ndecreases during pulse decay and there are two empirical relations\nbetween the temporal and spectral properties to characterize the\nspectral evolution. One important correlation is that between\nhardness of the spectrum, the peak energy, and fluence (HFC; Liang\n\\& Kargatis 1996). The other correlation is that between hardness\nand the instantaneous flux (or intensity) (HIC; Golenetskii et al.\n1983). The two relations appear to be satisfied by a substantial\nfraction of GRB pulses during the decay phase (see, Crider \\& Liang\n1999; Ryde \\& Svensson 2000). Most studies concerning these\ncorrelations examine them in single pulses and do not compare the\nbehavior of pulses within a burst. Combining the two correlations,\ni.e., the HIC and HFC, Ryde \\& Svensson (2000) showed that a\npower-law HIC and an exponential HFC resulted in the decay phase of\nthe pulse following power-law behaviors described by equations 3 and\n4 in their paper. Ryde \\& Svensson (2002) studied a sample\ncontaining 25 pulses and found that a power law gives a better\ndescription of the pulse decays than a stretched exponential, the\nmost commonly assumed pulse shape so far. They also found that there\nare no obviously preferred values of the power-law index of peak\nenergy, $E_{p}$, in the decay phase of pulse.\n\n%Many models have been proposed to account for the mechanisms that\n%generate this bursts. Two major scenarios are external and internal\n%shock model (Piran 1999), which both are in the context of\n%relativistic shells. In the external shock model the pulses are\n%formed when a relativistic shell ejected by the central engine is\n%decelerated by the circumstellar material (Meszaros \\& Rees 1993).\n%In the internal model (Ress \\& Meszaros 1994) the central engine\n%generates a relativistic flow with a highly non-uniform distribution\n%of the Lorentz factor and the pulses are made by collisions between\n%rapid and slower parts of the flow. An approach frequently used in\n%these models is to identify each pulse in the light curve with a\n%single physical event. This event could be the collision between\n%inhomogeneities in a relativistic wind in the internal models or the\n%''activation'' of a region on a single external shell.\nDaigne \\& Mochkovitch (2003) presented a simple, semi-analytical\nmodel to interpret the GRB temporal and spectral properties in the\ncontext of the internal shock model. The spectral evolution of\nsynthetic pulses was first obtained with standard equipartition\nassumptions to estimate the post-shock magnetic field and the\nelectron Lorentz factor. They found that $E_{p}$ $\\propto $\n$t^{-\\delta}$, which shows the decay of peak energy during the\npulses decay phase follows the power law relation with time. They\nalso compared the consistence of the power-law index, $\\delta$, of\ntheir model with the observed index provided by Ryde \\& Svensson\n(2002) and found that the synchrotron process with standard\nequipartition assumptions gives a much too steep spectral evolution,\nwhich showed that another process different from synchrotron one\nmight radiate that energy.\n\nThe observed GRB pulses are believed to be produced in a\nrelativistically expanding and collimated fireball because of the\nlarge energies and the short time-scales involved. The so-called\nDoppler effect (or curvature effect in some paper), which over the\nwhole fireball surface would play an important role to account for\nthe observed pulses and spectra of not only prompt GRBs but the\nearly X-ray afterglow, is that the photons emitted from the regions\non the line of sight and off the line of sight are Doppler-boosted\nby different factors and travel different distances before reaching\nthe observer (e.g. Meszaros and Rees 1998; Hailey et al. 1999; Qin\n2002, Qin et al. 2004, Qin 2008a, 2008b, 2008c). The curvature\neffect model of a cutoff power law spectrum has also been used to\nmodel the light curve and spectral evolution of the X-ray tail\n(Zhang et al. 2009). Based on the model of Doppler effect Lu et al.\n(2007) (hereafter Paper I) investigated the evolution of observed\nspectral peak energy $E_{p}$ and found that the evolutionary curve\nof $E_{p}$ undergoes a drop-to-rise-to-decay phase. The decay phase\nof the pulse, where the Doppler effect dominates, always decreases\nmonotonically and does not necessarily reflect the corresponding\nintrinsic spectral evolution. They first explored the case the\nintrinsic spectrum is the Band function (Band et al. 1993) for three\ndifferent local pulses. The three decay phases of $E_{p}$ within the\ndecay phase of the light curve were extracted and performed a linear\nleast-squares fit to the $E_{p}$ and relative observed time, $\\tau$,\nand have $\\log E_{p} = I - S \\log \\tau$, with the same slope of $S =\n0.95 \\pm 0.01$ for the three curves, which indicated that the slope\nof the decay phase of $E_{p}$ is not affected by the shape of its\nlocal pulse. Then they studied the case of intrinsic Comptonized and\nthermal synchrotron spectrum and found that corresponding slope $S =\n0.75 \\pm 0.01$ for both of the two intrinsic spectra, which also\nshowed that the slope is independent of the forms of local pulse.\n%A small sample including 12 pulses were tested and found 8 out of 12\n%pulses the decay slopes are consistent with the theoretical value of\n%$S_{1} = 0.95 \\pm 0.01$, whereas there are only two pulses are\n%consistent with the theoretical value of $S_{2} = 0.75 \\pm 0.01$,\n%which might imply that they are associated with the intrinsic\n%Comptonized or thermal synchrotron spectrum. In addition, there are\n%two outliers whose decay slopes are inconsistent with both\n%theoretical values.\n\nAlthough several GRB missions such as HETE-2 and Swift have been\nlaunched, the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE; Fishman\net al. 1989), aboard the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory (CGRO;\nGehrels et al. 1994), provided the largest GRB database from a\nsingle experiment among all the gamma-ray experiments that have\ndetected GRBs. The BATSE data are still the most suitable for\ndetailed spectral studies of GRB prompt emission, both in quantity\nand quality. For many of the BATSE GRBs, high time and energy\nresolution data are available. BATSE also provided wider energy\ncoverage than current GRB missions.\n\nIn the present work, we select two samples observed by BATSE  to\ninvestigate the evolutionary slope of $E_{p}$ during the decay phase\nof GRB pulses. Different from what Ryde \\& Svensson (2002) did, we\nadopt those well-separated FRED pulses compiled by Peng et al.\n(2007). First of all, we check whether the observed evolutionary\nslope of $E_{p}$ during the pulse decay phase is consistent with the\ntheoretical predication of Paper I. Examining whether the slope of\n$E_{p}$ during the decay phase of pulse is related to other\nparameters such as $E_{p}$ of time-integrated spectra is another\nmotivation of this work. In section 2, we present the sample\ndescription and spectral modeling. The results are given in section\n3. Discussion and conclusions are presented in the last section.\n\n%the power-law index of $E_{p}$ derived from HIC and HFC  for the\n%decay phase of our selected FRED pulses to test the possible model\n%of giving rise to these pulses."

        "question": "What effect does the average energy of supernova neutrinos have on the production of light elements like lithium and boron during the supernova explosion?",
        "introduction": "During supernova explosions, a huge amount of neutrinos are emitted, \nblowing off surface materials from the proto-neutron star.\nThe neutrinos interact with nuclei in the supernova ejecta, and the neutrino \nemission is strong enough to change the compositions, despite the small \ncross sections for neutrino-nucleus interactions.\nThe neutrino-induced reactions mainly affect two kinds of proposed\nnucleosynthetic processes that occur during supernova explosions: one is\nthe synthesis of light elements such as Li and B through the $\\nu$-process \nin the He-layer, and the other is the $r$-process in the neutrino-driven \nwinds above the surface of the neutron star.\n\nThe production of light elements through the $\\nu$-process during \nsupernova explosions was first suggested by Domogatsky, Eramzhyan, \\& \nNadyozhin (1977).\nWoosley et al. (1990) precisely evaluated the roles of the $\\nu$-process\nand showed that a large amount of $^7$Li and $^{11}$B is produced during\nsupernova explosions.\nWoosley \\& Weaver (1995, hereafter WW95) tabulated the abundances of \nthe elements, including the light elements with grids of stellar masses \nand metallicities. \nTheir results have been adopted for studies on Galactic chemical \nevolution (GCE; e.g., Fields et al. 2000; Ramaty et al. 2000b; \nRyan et al. 2001).\n\nHowever, Olive et al. (1994) pointed out that there remains a serious problem \nof overproduction of $^{11}$B from the supernova $\\nu$-process in the GCE models of \nthe light elements.\nHere the overproduction means that the predicted $^{11}$B abundance in \ntheoretical calculations is overabundant compared to the observed one when \nwe adopt the theoretical yields of WW95 without any renormalization.\nStudies on GCE have shown that light elements are mostly produced \nfrom Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) interactions with the interstellar medium \n(ISM).\nThe GCR model was improved by taking account of the primary acceleration of \nheavy elements from supernova ejecta in addition to the secondary \nacceleration of the engulfing ISM (Ramaty et al. 1997; \nYoshii, Kajino, \\& Ryan 1997; Vangioni-Flam et al. 1998; \nSuzuki, Yoshii, \\& Kajino 1999).\nThis explains the naturally linear metal dependence of the amounts of Be and B \nduring GCE; i.e., [BeB/H] $\\propto$ [Fe/H], but one still needs another \ncontribution to $^7$Li and $^{11}$B (Olive et al. 1994; Vangioni-Flam et al. \n1996; Fields \\& Olive 1999; Romano et al. 1999).\nThe production of $^{11}$B in the supernova $\\nu$-process is identified as \nthe most important process for explaining the very precise data of the \nmeteoritic $^{11}$B/$^{10}$B abundance ratio. \nSeveral authors studied the GCE models of the light elements by taking account \nof the contribution of the supernova $\\nu$-process.\nThey showed that the amount of $^{11}$B is too large by a factor of 2 \n(Fields et al. 2000) to 5 (Ramaty, Lingenfelter, \\& Kozolvsky 2000a), \nwhile the other light elements $^6$Li, $^7$Li, $^9$Be, and $^{10}$B are \nwell reproduced in the appropriate amount.\n\nMass loss of the outer envelope in the presupernova evolutionary phase would \ndecrease the efficiency of $^{11}$B production in the $\\nu$-process during the \nsupernova explosion.\nWolf-Rayet stars in fact exhibit strong activities in their stellar \natmosphere, such as mass loss.\nThey originate from stars as massive as 40 $M_{\\odot}$ (e.g., \nAbbott \\& Conti 1987; Meynet et al. 2001).\nSince the supernovae discussed in the present article have main-sequence \nmasses of 13-30 $M_{\\odot}$, there is no need to take account \nof such a mass-loss effect.\n\nThe production of $^7$Li and $^{11}$B during the supernova explosion depends \non the supernova models.\nIt also depends on the details of the total neutrino luminosity and its time \nvariation.\nMoreover, the yet uncertain average neutrino energy should strongly affect the \n$\\nu$-spallation cross sections of $^4$He, providing seed elements for the \nproduction of $^7$Li and $^{11}$B (WW95).\nSince the supernova neutrinos would therefore affect the final abundance of \n$^7$Li and $^{11}$B (Fields et al. 2000; Yoshida, Emori, \\& Nakazawa 2000), \nwe should investigate the dependence on the \nneutrino spectra to solve the overproduction problem.\n\n\nFollowing the core explosion of a supernova, a ^^ ^^ hot bubble'' region, \nin which the density is relatively low and the temperature and entropy are \nhigh, is formed between the surface of the proto-neutron star and the outward \nshock wave.\nIn the region near the surface of the proto-neutron star, the material is \nblown off by neutrino heating.\nThe outflow of the material is also called the ^^ ^^ neutrino-driven wind''.\nWoosley et al. (1994) showed that the $r$-process occurs successfully \nin neutrino-driven winds with very high entropy, $400k$, where $k$ denotes \nthe Boltzmann constant.\nHowever, their nucleosynthesis calculation did not include \nneutrino-nucleus interactions during the postprocessing of the nucleosynthesis.\nIt was subsequently pointed out that the supernova neutrinos convert neutrons \ninto protons during nucleosynthesis and that the $r$-process has difficulty \nin producing third-peak elements because of the neutron deficiency even \nin a high-entropy hot bubble (Fuller \\& Meyer 1995; Meyer 1995).\nIt was also reported that independent simulations of neutrino-driven winds \nhave difficulty in producing the required high-entropy condition \n(Witti, Janka \\& Takahashi 1994; Takahashi, Witti, \\& Janka 1994).\nThus, neutrino-driven winds were suspected to be a site of the $r$-process.\n\nRecently, neutrino-driven wind models have been revived as promising sites \nof $r$-process nucleosynthesis by using a moderately high entropy, \n$\\sim 200 k$, and a very short expansion timescale, $\\sim 10$ ms \n(Otsuki et al. 2000; Sumiyoshi et al. 2000).\nMassive ($\\sim 2.0 M_{\\odot}$) and compact ($10$ km) neutron star models \nare assumed in order to obtain such conditions.\nIt is known, however, that the typical mass of a neutron star is about \n$1.4 M_{\\odot}$ and that the radius is about 10 km.\nTerasawa et al. (2002) have recently shown the possibility for \na successful $r$-process abundance pattern to emerge from a neutron \nstar model with a typical mass of $1.4 M_{\\odot}$ and a radius of $10$ km; \nthey use a slightly low asymptotic temperature at the outer boundary \nof the neutrino-driven winds.\nIn all these simulations, they set the mean energies of neutrinos to be about \n$10, 20$, and $30$ MeV  for $\\nu_e, \\bar{\\nu_e}$, and $\\nu_i$ \n($i = \\mu, \\tau$, and their antiparticles), respectively, to match with those \nadopted in a previous theoretical study (Qian \\& Woosley 1996).\n\nIn light of the successful $r$-process nucleosynthesis in neutrino-driven \nwinds, it is of current interest and importance to study how to solve the \noverproduction problem of the light elements in the $\\nu$-process in the \nsame supernova model.\nSince neutrinos are very weakly interacting particles, their energy spectrum \nwould not change in the ejecta unless neutrino oscillation were considered.\nNevertheless, there was no attention given to the fact that the supernova \nneutrino model, which is used for light-element synthesis during supernova \nexplosions, should be identical to that adopted in the neutrino-driven \nwind models.\n\nIn the present study we use a common neutrino luminosity that\ndecreases with time in the application to both light-element synthesis in the \nHe layer and $r$-process synthesis in neutrino-driven winds.\nWe investigate the sensitivity of light-element synthesis in supernova ejecta \nto the neutrino luminosity with the two parameters of the decay time \n$\\tau_{\\nu}$ and the total neutrino energy $E_{\\nu}$.\nAt the same time, we simulate the neutrino-driven winds with the same \nneutrino luminosity parameters and calculate the $r$-process abundance pattern.\nWe thus discuss the consistency between the light-element production and the \nabundance distribution of the $r$-process elements and try to solve the \noverproduction problem of the light elements in GCE.\n\nIn addition to the ambiguity of the neutrino luminosity, neutrino temperature \nis still a controversial problem.\nAlthough extensive studies by supernova simulations with neutrino transfer \nhave been done by several groups (e.g., Janka, Kilfonidis, \\& Rampp 2001; \nLiebend\\\"orfer et al. 2001; Thompson, Burrows, \\& Pinto 2003; \nBuras et al. 2003), the explosion mechanism has not yet been clarified.\nAccordingly, the information on supernova neutrinos has not been uniquely \ndetermined.\nDetailed studies on supernova neutrinos have been made to determine the \nneutrino luminosity and spectra (Myra \\& Burrows 1990; Suzuki 1994; \nTotani et al. 1998; Keil, Raffelt, \\& Janka 2003).\nHence, it is also important to investigate the sensitivity of \nthe light-element production and the $r$-process abundance pattern \nto the temperature of the $e$-, $\\mu$-, and $\\tau$-neutrino families \nusing a common luminosity for the supernova neutrinos.\nRecent theoretical studies on explosive nucleosynthesis in supernovae\n(e.g., Rauscher et al. 2002) have shown a smaller ejected mass of $^{11}$B, \nmoving toward a solution of the overproduction problem.\nThey assumed slightly lower temperatures of $\\mu$- and $\\tau$-type \nneutrinos and their antiparticles ($\\nu_{\\mu,\\tau}$ and \n$\\bar{\\nu}_{\\mu,\\tau}$) than those adopted in WW95.\nWe therefore explore many different neutrino luminosities with different \nneutrino temperatures to look for an appropriate ejected mass of $^{11}$B \nand $r$-process abundance pattern.\nThis result would in turn strongly constrain models of supernova neutrinos."

But it is also necessary to remember that, say, the \nstill poorly understood and unpredictable earthquakes are claiming \nthousands of human lives per year. Is it possible that the \ncutting-edge technology of g.w. interferometers \\cite{ligoweb, GEOweb,\nvirgoweb, TAMAweb} may help us with accurate geophysical studies, \nas a by-product of the continuous search for astrophysical \ngravitational waves ? \n\nThis is the major question of the present work, and the \nanswer is positive. We shall show in this paper \nthat a laser-beam detector of gravitational waves is in fact \nautomatically a valuable geophysical device. Without collecting, \nrecording and processing environmental information of geophysical\norigin, a g.w. laser interferometer would simply be incapable of \nworking as a sensitive astrophysical instrument. Certainly, we have to \nmake sure that the extraction of geophysical information \ndoes not compromise the astrophysical aims of the instrument.\n \nA laser-beam detector of gravitational waves is a conceptually simple\ninstallation. Each arm of the interferometer, typically of the\nlength $L= 3~km$, consists of two mirrors, and the distance variation \nbetween the mirrors is monitored by the laser beam. The mirrors\nare hanging on wires in supporting towers. Each mirror is  \nessentially a mass element of the pendulum placed in the local \ngravitational field of the Earth. The eigen-frequency of the pendulum is\nnormally in the range of $0.1 - 1~Hz$. The multi-stage pendulum system \nshields the mirrors from large uncontrollable displacements of the \ntops of the supporting towers. This makes the interferometer capable of \nmeasuring, in the region of relatively high frequencies of \nastrophysical interest $\\sim 30 - 10^3~ Hz$, the incredibly small \nvariations of distance between the mirrors, at the level of \n$10^{-16}~ cm$. The expected cause of these variations is the \nincoming astrophysical gravitational wave. \n\nThe isolation from noises in the region of relatively high\nfrequencies is only a part of the story. To ensure successful \nperformance of the interferometer as an astrophysical instrument, \ncontrol systems of the interferometer should also register and \ncompensate for large external interventions of geophysical origin that \ntake place in the region of relatively low frequencies. For example, the \ntidal half-daily variations of distance beween towers separated by $3~ km$ \nare typically at the level of $10^{-2}~ cm$. This change of distance is \n14 orders of magnitude larger than the anticipated astrophysical signal. \nIf this sort of variations were allowed to affect distance between \nthe mirrors, the interferometer would not be in the `locked' state,\nand hence it would not be able to operate as astrophysical instrument. \nThe `locking' of the interferometer requires that the distance between\nthe mirrors is maintained unchanged with accuracy of approximately one \nhundredth of the laser light wavelength, which amounts to \n$10^{-6}~ cm$ and less. This means that the low-frequency variations \nof distance between the mirrors should be monitored and largely \nremoved by a control system called the adjustment system. \nA similar monitoring and compensation should be done with respect \nto low-frequency variations of the angle between the \ninterferometer mirrors. This is being done by a control system \ncalled the alighnment system. Ideally, in order to reach the \nastrophysical goals, control systems should keep the interferometer \nin the working condition for the duration of time \nexceeding many months. \n\nThus, the collected and recorded low-frequency information, \nwhich is vital for maintaining the operational state \nof the laser-beam detector of gravitational waves, \ninevitably makes the g.w. detector also a geophysical \ninstrument. The time-scales of geophysical processes, some of \nwhich are believed to be crucial for global geodynamics, lie in the \nrange from several minutes to several hours. In other words, we will be\ninterested in frequencies, which we call geophysical frequencies, \nsomewhere in the interval $10^{-5} - 3 \\times 10^{-3}~Hz$. \n\nIn Sec.2 we consider a simple model of g.w. interferometer as\na geophysical instrument. It is assumed that the mirrors' suspension points \ncan move and the plumb lines of hanging mirrors can vary. These changes\narise as a result of the Earth surface deformations and variations\nof local gravitational field caused, for example, by the internal \nEarth dynamics. We derive general formulas for the distance between the\nmirrors and the angles between the local plumb lines. Ideally, these are\ntwo variables that are supposed to be monitored by, respectively, the \nadjustment and alignment systems of the interferometer.\n\nIn Sec.3 we consider a number of interesting geophysical phenomena which\ninevitably affect the performance of a g.w. interferometer. The \nsignatures of these phenomena are contained in the outcomes of the \nadjustment and alignment control systems. The geophysical effects to be \nstudied include tidal perturbations, normal modes of Earth oscillations,\nmovements of the inner solid core of Earth, etc. We place the main\nemphasis on the fascinating phenomenon of the inner core oscillations.\nWe estimate the useful geophysical signal accompanying this phenomenon, \nwhich will manifest itself in the variation of distance between the \nmirrors and in the variation of angle between the plumb lines of the\nhanging mirrors. The guidance for the expected amplitude of the signal \nis provided by the reported in the literature indications that the \ninner core oscillations have been actually detected by other, traditional, \nmethods. From the requirement that the signal to noise\nratio should be larger than 1, we define the level of tolerable \nnoise in the proposed measurements. Specifically, the tolerable noise \nallows the detection of the useful signal, if the observation time \nexceeds 70, or so, inner core oscillation periods. \n\nA useful signal can be detected if the environmental and instrumental\nnoises are smaller than the calculated level of tolerable noise. In Sec.4 \nwe consider noises which we find most dangerous. We explicitely show \nthat seismic, atmospheric and instrumental noises should not \nbe capable of preventing the detection of inner core oscillations, \neven if only marginally. This refers both to distance and angle measurements.\nThere exists, however, a specific problem with the angle measurements,\nrelated to the fact that the presently operating alignment systems \nare subject to a certain degeneracy. They cannot tell apart a tilt of the\nmirror, which we are mostly interested in, and a latteral shift of the\nmirror, which can be caused by a dull deformational noise. We analyze\nthis difficulty in great detail in Sec.5.\n\nSince the angular measurements provide an important additional channel \nof geophysical information, we adress the problem of degeneracy in \nSec.6 and suggest the ways of its circumvention. The desire to\nkeep the angular channel useful for geophysical applications may require \nsome modest and harmless modifications of the optical scheme of g.w.\ninterferometers. We discuss at some length a few ideas with regard\nto such modifications. It appears that, without interfering with\nthe astrophysical program of the instrument, certain geophysical\nmodifications are feasible.\n\nIn Sec.7 we emphasize some conclusions of the paper."

        "question": "How many terabytes of data does the Sloan Digital Sky Survey archive contain as of the early 2000s?",
        "introduction": "Since 2000, the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) \\citep{York2000} collected the more \ndata that had been amassed in the entire history of astronomy. Now, its archive \ncontains of about 156 terabytes of information. Astronomers, who are directly \ninvolved in the SDSS, identified the problem of morphological galaxy classification \n``as one of the most cumbersome areas in celestial classification, and the one that \nhas proven the most difficult to automate\" \\citep{Kasivajhula2007}. Notwithstanding, \nwe would like to underline briefly several works, where different approaches were \ndeveloped and great efforts were made to identify the morphological types of galaxies, \nfirst of all from the SDSS, in the visual or the automated modes. We note that many \nmachine learning methods were actively involved to disentangle this problem. \nA good introduction to the classification algorithms for astronomical tasks, \nincluding the morphological classification of galaxies, is given by \\cite{Feigelson2006},\n\\cite{BallBrunner2010}, \\cite{Ivezic2014}.\n\nDuring 1990-es, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm was widely intended \nfor automatic morphological classification of galaxies since the very \nlarge extragalactic data sets have been conducted \\citep{Storrie1992}. \nA classification accuracy (or the success rate) of the ANN was from 65\\,\\% to 90\\,\\% \ndepending on the mathematical subtleties of the applied methods and the quality \nof galaxy samples. For example, \\cite{Lahav1995} concluded that ``the ANNs can \nreplicate the classification by a human expert almost to the same degree of \nagreement as that between two human experts, to within 2 $T$-type units\".  \n\\cite{Ball2004} have tested the Supervised ANN for morphological classifications and obtained \nthat it may be applied without human intervention for the SDSS (correlations between predicted \nand actual properties were around 0.9 with rms errors of order 10 \\%). \\cite{Andrae2010} \napplied a probabilistic classification algorithm to classify the SDSS bright galaxies and \nobtained that it produces reasonable morphological classes and object-to-class assignments \nwithout any prior assumptions. \\cite{Murru2017} evaluated the Convolutional Neural Network \nto classify galaxies from the SDSS onto two classes as ellipticals/spirals and achieved an accuracy around 90--91\\,\\%.\n\nAs for the visual morphological classification conducted during the last years, \nwe note as follows. A very powerful study was performed by \\cite{Banerji2010},\nwhere galaxies classified by the Galaxy Zoo Project (\\url{http://data.galaxyzoo.org}) \ninto three classes (early types, spirals, spam objects) have formed a training sample \nfor morphological classifications of galaxies in the SDSS DR6. These authors convincingly \nshowed that using a set of certain galaxy parameters, the Neural Network is able to \nreproduce the human classifications to better than 90\\,\\% for all these classes \nand that the Galaxy Zoo catalogue (GZ1) can serve as a training sample. For example, \nusing the raw imaging data from the SDSS that was available in the GZ1, and the hand-picked features from the SDSS,  \\cite{Kates2012} applied a logistic \nregression classifier and attained 95.21 \\% classification accuracy. \n\\cite{Willett2013} issued a new catalogue of morphological types from Galaxy Zoo Project (GZ2)\nin the synergy with the SDSS DR7, which contains of more than 16 million morphological\nclassifications of 304\\,122 galaxies and their finer morphological features (bars,\nbulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as parameters of the relative strengths\nof galactic bulges and spiral arms). Another approach was developed by \\cite{Nair2010}.\nNamely, they prepared the detailed visual classifications for 14\\,034 galaxies in the\nSDSS DR4 at $z<0.1$, which can be used as a good training sample for calibrating the automated galaxy classification algorithms. \n\nOur work deals with a morphological classification of low-redshift galaxies from the SDSS DR5 and DR9 and has the following tasks:\n    \\begin{itemize}\n     \\item to analyze the existing criteria for automatic morphological classification of \n     galaxies using parameters, which are most correlated with morphology of galaxies: \n     color indices, inverse concentration index, absolute magnitude, de Vaucouleurs radius and scale radius; \n\t\\item to use various machine learning methods for classifying 60\\,561 lgalaxies from the SDSS DR9 with unknown morphological types;\n\t\\item to apply the developed criteria for the automated classification of 317\\,018 galaxies at $z<0.1$ from SDSS DR9.\n       \\end{itemize}"

        "question": "What is the typical full width at half maximum (FWHM) used to distinguish narrow absorption lines (NALs) from other types of absorption features in quasar spectra?",
        "introduction": "The optical-UV spectra of the quasar are generally characterized by a power-law shaped continuum, and often accompanied by a plenty of prominent and/or forbidden emission lines with different profiles. Continuum and emission lines are very important and advantageous for our insight into the quasar's structure, dynamics, environment, and so on. In recent years, the observations of integral field units (IFUs) have become very popular, which could obtain more detailed information of objects. While this novel technology is mainly popularized to nearby extended sources \\cite[e.g.;][]{2002MNRAS.329..513D,2011ApJ...739L..47B,2011MNRAS.413..813C,2015ApJ...798....7B}, since it depends on the luminosity of each emission structure and spatial resolving power of the telescope. The IFU observation is very difficultly applied to obtain substructure information within the host galaxies of high redshift quasars (e.g., $z>1$). In addition, the low gas density of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) and intergalactic medium (IGM) determines that the emissions of the CGM and IGM are very difficultly detected with available facilities thought there are a few successful results by deep imaging and spectroscopy \\cite[e.g.;][]{2014Natur.506...63C,2014ApJ...786..106M,2015ApJ...809..163A,2015Sci...348..779H,2015MNRAS.452.2388H,2016ApJS..226...25L,2017ApJ...848...78F,2017A&A...599A..28K,2017A&A...604A..23N}. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a large sample of emission line data so that we can well constrain the characteristics of the quasar's CGM and IGM.\n\nQuasar photons pass through foreground gaseous clouds along the quasar sightline, which are usually expected to produce absorption features in the quasar spectra. The foreground gaseous clouds have a wild range of locations, which can be located at any position between the quasar center emission regions and the observer. Therefore, one often expects that quasar absorption lines have a wild range of origins, which can be roughly divided into two categories, namely intervening and associated/intrinsic gas media. The intervening gas medium \\cite[e.g.;][]{1986A&A...155L...8B,1991A&A...243..344B,2005pgqa.conf....5T,2008AJ....135..922K,2010ApJ...714.1521C} is beyond the gravitational well of the quasar system, and produces absorption features that have a significantly different redshift from the quasar system, which are usually called as intervening absorption systems. The associated/intrinsic gas medium would be located within the quasar host galaxy, galaxy halo and galaxy cluster, and produces absorption features with redshift similar to the quasar system  \\cite[e.g.;][]{2004ApJ...613..129W,2007ApJS..171....1M,2008ApJ...679..239V,2012ApJ...748..131S}, which are generally called as associated absorption systems. Of course, if the associated absorption systems are related to the quasar outflow/wind with high velocity, they would host redshifts that are obviously smaller than the quasar emission redshifts \\cite[e.g.;][]{2009NewAR..53..128C,2012ASPC..460...37C,2013MNRAS.434.3275C,2013ApJ...777...56C,2013MNRAS.434..163H}. Absorption signatures are very common in the quasar spectra, and their detections do not depend on the quasar emissions. In theory, absorption features would be marked on the quasar spectra as long as the quasar continuum emission passes through foreground gas medium before it reaches the observer. Therefore, the quasar associated absorption lines would be an efficient and important tool leading our insight into the nature of quasar dynamics, structures, gas distributions, environments, and so on.\n\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky survey \\cite[SDSS;][]{2000AJ....120.1579Y} is a very great project in astronomy community, which utilizes a dedicated wide-field 2.5 m telescope \\cite[][]{2006AJ....131.2332G} located at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico to image the universe in five broad bands \\cite[ugriz;][]{1996AJ....111.1748F}. The SDSS started routine spectroscopy survey in 2000 April, and in the following 8 years (2000 April --- 2008 July), the Legacy Survey of the SDSS obtained 105 783 spectroscopically confirmed quasars \\cite[e.g.;][]{2009ApJS..182..543A,2010AJ....139.2360S}. As the third stage of the SDSS (SDSS-III), the SDSS continued to collect data from 2008 July to 2014 June with update spectrographs \\cite[][]{2013AJ....146...32S}, and the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), which is the main dark time of the Legacy Survey of the SDSS-III, obtained $\\rm 297~301$ unique quasars specra \\cite[e.g.;][]{2011ApJS..193...29A,2013AJ....145...10D,2017A&A...597A..79P}. In our series of works on quasar-associated absorption systems, we will make use of the spectroscopically confirmed quasars compiled from the Legacy Survey of the first three stages of the SDSS \\cite[e.g.;][]{2010AJ....139.2360S,2017A&A...597A..79P} to assemble and analyze \\SiIVab, \\CIVab\\ and \\MgIIab\\ absorption doublets. Basing on the line widths of their profiles, quasar-associated absorption systems can be roughly classified into narrow absorption line systems (NALs), broad absorption line systems (BALs), and mini-BALs. The NALs generally show sharp profiles with full width at half maximum (FWHMs) less than a few hundred \\kms. In this paper, we define NALs with FWHM $<1000$ \\kms. As the first in a series of works on the SDSS quasar-associated absorption systems, this paper aims to look for \\MgII\\ NALs in the spectral data around \\MgIIwave\\ emission lines and statistically analyze the properties of the associated \\MgII\\ absorption systems.\n\nSection \\ref{sect:datasample} characterizes the quasar sample and spectral analysis. We present the properties of the \\MgII\\ absorption systems and discussions in Section \\ref{sect:properties_discussions}. The  summary is presented in Section \\ref{sect:summary}. In this paper, we adopt the $\\rm \\Lambda CDM$ cosmology with $\\rm \\Omega_M=0.3$, $\\rm \\Omega_\\Lambda=0.7$, and $\\rm H_0=70~km~s^{-1}~Mpc^{-1}$."

        "introduction": "Being able to determine accurate estimates of the various solar mode\nparameters is an important goal in helioseismology. Using inversion\ntechniques frequencies of the oscillation modes can be used to\nconstrain estimates of the sound speed and density in the solar\ninterior, while the rotational splitting of the modes can determine\nthe internal rotation rate.\n\nOver the years the quality and quantity of helioseismic data has\nimproved significantly enabling the parameter values to be\nconstrained with increasingly greater precision. However, with\ngreater precision comes the need for greater accuracy and this can\nonly be archived if the models used to fit the data are also\naccurate.\n\nFor low-degree (low-$\\ell$) Sun-as-a-star observations, the most\ncommon method of fitting is to split the power spectrum into a\nseries of fitting regions centered on $\\ell$ = 0/2 and 1/3 pairs.\nThe modes are then fitted, pair by pair, to determine the parameter\nvalues without the need to fit the entire spectrum simultaneously.\n\nThe main advantage of this ``pair-by-pair\" fitting method (hereafter\nabbreviated PPM) is its computational efficiency, since the number\nof parameters being varied is small. However, the cost of this\nefficiency is that the model used to fit the data encompasses only\nthose modes within the fitting region.

        "question": "What is the smallest known angular image separation among galactic-scale gravitational lens systems?",
        "introduction": "The double-image gravitational lens \\Bs was discovered in the Jodrell-VLA\\footnote{Very Large Array,\nNRAO} Astrometric Survey~(JVAS) of radio sources \\citep{Patnaik1992b}. It has the smallest angular\nimage-separation ($\\sim 330$~mas) amongst the known galactic-scale lens systems. The lensed object\nis a powerful radio galaxy (blazar) at a redshift of 0.944 \\citep{Cohen2003} with a typical core-jet\nmorphology and a frequency-dependent structure. Further, it has a variable radio emission and the\ntime-delay between variations in the images has been accurately measured by \\citet{Biggs1999},\n\\mbox{(10.5 $\\pm$ 0.4)~days}, which is consistent with the value of\n\\mbox{(10.1$^{+1.5}_{-1.6}$)~days} measured by \\citet{Cohen2000}. The lens is at a redshift of 0.684\n\\citep[][see also O'Dea~et~al.~1992]{Browne1993} and is believed to be a spiral galaxy based on the\nsmall angular image-separation and radio absorption lines that have been measured for this system. A\nrobust confirmation is provided by the recent HST-ACS image of this system with a very high\nresolution and sensitivity \\citep{York2005}, which clearly shows the two point images and the\nunderlying spiral structure of the lens galaxy.\n\n\\nocite{Dea1992}\n\nHigh-resolution maps of \\Bs using long baseline interferometers, such as the VLBA and the VLBI\nnetworks, reveal A and B to consist of two distinct components with similar separations\n($\\gtrsim$~1~mas) but with different relative shapes and orientations. The double features, 1 and 2,\nshown in Fig.~\\ref{fig:2cm} are identified with the core-jet morphology of a flat-spectrum radio\nsource, with component 1, based on its high turn over frequency, as the core or the jet-base, and\ncomponent 2 as a jet-component. The phenotypical core-jet picture of the background source is more\npronounced in the 8.4~GHz global VLBI maps by \\citet{Biggs2003}, in which the low-brightness\nemission constituting the jet is seen to extend out to $\\sim 15$~mas to 20~mas from the core in both\nthe images.  \\citet{Mittal2006} detected another component in the VLBI hybrid-map of image A at\n1.65~GHz~[see Figure~(8a) of their paper], which is separated by 12~mas from the superposition of\ncomponents 1 and 2. This feature is designated as component 3 and has not been found to have a\ncounterpart in image B.\n\n\\begin{figure} \n  \\centering\n  \\includegraphics[width=0.5\\textwidth]{lens2cm.eps}\n  \\caption{VLBI 15-GHz map of \\Bs for image A (right) and B (left), plotted with a restoring beam of\n    0.5~mas.}\n  \\label{fig:2cm}\n\\end{figure}\n\n\nAll the observed characteristics of this lens system, such as the lens-geometry and the image\npositions, can be reconstructed well using a simple lens-model, except the image flux-density\nratios. The anomaly in the image flux-density ratios in \\Bs was addressed and discussed extensively\nby \\citet[][hereafter M06]{Mittal2006}. It does not violate the \\textit{cusp or fold relations}\nobservable only in four-image systems, as is the case with the majority of other systems which show\nimage flux ratio anomalies. Instead there is a steady decline in the image flux-density ratio (A/B)\nfrom 4 to 2 with decreasing radio frequencies from $\\sim$ 20~GHz to 1~GHz, which violates the\nachromatic nature of the phenomenon of GL. In M06, the authors took into account the combined effect\nof an extended background object with a frequency-dependent structure and a strong gradient in the\nrelative image-magnification over the image plane, both of which exist in the \\Bs lens system. The\ntechnique of inverse phase-referencing was used to establish the positions of image-centroids at\nfive radio frequencies.  The results of their analysis led them to discard the gradient in the\nimage-magnification ratio across the images as a cause of the flux ratio anomaly in \\B.\n\nIn the present work, we extend this investigation but also seek other explanations, of entirely\ndifferent origins, for the flux ratio anomaly. The intervening matter along the lines-of-sight to\nthe gravitationally lensed images can, through non-gravitational (electromagnetic) effects, produce\ndeviations in the image properties. Emission from the background source can be absorbed and/or\nscattered causing a change in the original radiation intensity. These mechanisms, in combination\nwith the resolution of the observations, can affect the surface brightness of the lensed images\ndifferently and perturb the image flux-density ratio from its expected value. The most common\nphysical processes that occur are extinction in the optical region, and free-free absorption,\nscatter-broadening and Faraday rotation in the radio region. It is generally assumed that these\nmechanisms occur in the ISM of the lens galaxies and, when they occur, cause the lens to be no\nlonger `transparent'. It is to be noted that whichever mechanism is responsible for the flux ratio\nanomaly in \\B, it should explicitly produce a frequency-dependent change in the image flux-density\nratios, as observed. The physical quantities which appear in these above-mentioned astrophysical\nprocesses and which induce this $\\nu$--dependence are the refractive index of the intervening plasma\nin the case of scatter-broadening and optical-depth in the case of free-free absorption.\n\nWhile the task of identifying the signatures of gravitational lensing becomes more difficult in the\npresence of above interfering effects, this can be exploited to our benefit by allowing us to probe\nthe medium of the intervening lens galaxy in detail \\citep{Biggs2005}. Based on radio propagation\neffects, VLBI techniques have been largely used to explore the lens galaxy in numerous lens\nsystems. Such observations reveal a variety of constituents which otherwise are hard to detect, such\nas atomic and molecular species at different redshifts \\citep{Kanekar2003a,Chengalur1999} and\nsolar-mass objects that result in microlensing of the background radiation\n\\citep{Koopmans2000a}. Radio polarization measurements help us to study the ionized gas fraction and\nlarge-scale magnetic fields in galaxies \\citep{Narsimha2004a}. These studies are interesting also\nfor understanding the redshift evolution of elemental abundances and large-scale magnetic fields.\n\nThere is a substantial body of evidence which indicates that the ISM in front of image A is rich in\ngas and dust. \\citet{Falco1999} investigated 37 differential extinction curves in 23 gravitational\nlens galaxies and found that \\Bs and one other system (PKS~1830$-$211) in their sample have\nexceptionally high differential extinctions between the images of the lensed object \\citep[see\nalso][]{Munoz2004}. According to their measurements, the selective extinction for image A is higher\nthan for image B by $\\Delta E_{B-V} =0.9$ mag and the total (selective) extinction along the\nlines-of-sight to both the images is equal to $E_{B-V}=0.6$. This result is not surprising as there\nare various observations of atomic and molecular absorption lines in \\Bs\n\\citep{Henkel2005,Kanekar2003,Combes1998,Combes1997,Wiklind1995,Carilli1993} that present strong\nevidence of large amounts of molecular gas and H{\\sc i} in the lens galaxy. However, a strong\nrelative extinction in image A additionally implies that the molecular cloud, which is associated\nwith these molecular absorption lines, lies in front of image A. This is in agreement with the\nobservations of H{\\sc i} absorption in \\Bs using VLBI with a resolution of 80~mas by\n\\citet{Carilli2000}. They found that the dominant contribution to the H{\\sc i} 21~cm line comes from\nthe south-west component~(image~A). Similar findings were achieved by \\citet{Menten1996} who\nobserved the formaldehyde~(H$_2$CO) absorption lines with the VLA at 14.1~GHz and 8.6~GHz~(the VLA\nprovides an angular resolution of $\\lesssim 0.2$~arcsec at these frequencies). They showed that the\nabsorption arises solely due to image A and derived an upper limit on the optical depth for image B,\na factor three times smaller than that calculated for image A. This also lends support to the\nexplanation proffered by \\citet{York2005} in order to account for the mismatch in the image\nseparation between the radio and the optical measurements. Dust obscuration of image A can also\nexplain why image B is observed to be brighter than image A at optical wavelengths\n\\citep{Jackson2000,Lehar2000} while the opposite is true at all radio wavelengths.\n\nThe goal of this paper is multifold. First, we carry our investigation along the lines of argument\nsimilar to those presented in M06 further. The question that motivated additional investigation of\nthe frequency-dependent structure of the \\Bs images is whether the magnification at the centroid\nposition, $\\mu(\\vec{x}_c)$, gives a good estimate of the average magnification~(to be defined in\nSection~\\ref{sec:sec1}) suffered by an extended object. For a simple source structure this may\nreasonably and intuitively be assumed but for complicated source structures involving steep\nmagnification gradients in the image plane, the assumption does not hold any longer.\n\nSecond, we investigate the effects of non-gravitational processes on the image flux-densities in \\Bs\nin the hope of solving the long-standing problem of inconsistent image-magnification ratios. The\nmain focus of the present work is to explore these non-gravitational effects. The layout of the\npaper is as follows. In Section~\\ref{sec:sec1} we give an introduction of the lens models derived\nfrom the LensClean algorithm \\citep{Wucknitz2004b}, which we use throughout the paper. Here we also\ncalculate the magnification-weighted image flux-density ratios in detail to assess the contribution\nof this effect to the flux-ratio anomaly. The propagation effects are described in\nSection~\\ref{sec:prop}, which covers the free-free absorption mechanism~(Section~\\ref{sec:ffa}) and\nrefractive scattering~(Section~\\ref{sec:scatt}). Finally, we present a discussion on the results\nobtained from the above analyses in Section~\\ref{sec:disc} and conclude our work on the flux ratio\nanomaly in \\Bs in Section~\\ref{sec:conc}. All these investigations were carried out based on the\nmulti-frequency VLBI observations of this lens system, which are presented in M06. Throughout the\npaper we adopt the flat $\\Lambda$CDM concordance cosmological model for our calculations, with a\nHubble parameter of $H_\\st{ 0} = 71$~km~s$^{-1}$~Mpc$^{-1}$ and a cosmological constant of\n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda} = 0.73$."

        "question": "What is the primary mechanism responsible for the strong emission lines observed in HII galaxies?",
        "introduction": "HII galaxies are characterised by prominent emission lines.\n   In fact, they are defined as having strong H$\\beta$ and\n   OIII lines, but other ionised hydrogen (H$\\alpha$, H$\\gamma$,\n   etc.) and high excitation metallicity lines (OII, NII, and others)\n   are strong too.\n   These emission lines are driven by photoionisation of interstellar\n   gas by hot massive stars from young stellar populations\n   \\citep{sargent,french}.\n   The star forming activity in HII galaxies is so strong that\n   it can certainly not have been maintained at its present level\n   during a Hubble time \\citep*[see e.g.][]{searle2}.\n   In fact, they are the most extreme case of star forming galaxies,\n   showing the highest excitation emission lines, and thus the highest\n   (relative) star formation rates (SFRs). \\\\\n   They are also the lowest metallicity galaxies of the interstellar\n   medium, with metallicities around one tenth solar\n   \\citep*[][and others]{vilchez,perezmonteroa,kniazev,kehrigvilchez,izotov,haegele,perezmonteroc}. \\\\\n   It is now clear that the hypothesis of HII galaxies as galaxies\n   experiencing their first star formation burst can be ruled out, and\n   that their stellar content is predominantly old, older than one Gyr\n    \\citep*[][and others]{raimann,cidfernandes,kong,westera_04,cidasari,asari,hoyos},\n   Nevertheless, both the high relative SFRs and the low metallicities\n   indicate that HII galaxies are among the least evolved galaxies\n   in existence, which assigns to them a special role as fossil record\n   of galaxy evolution \\citep{lequeux}.\n   They are, therefore, ideal objects for chemical evolution studies.\n\n   Several authors have developed theoretical evolutionary models of\n   dwarf irregular galaxies, of which HII galaxies are a sub-category.\n   Some of these models predict the galaxies' present-day stellar - and gas\n   metallicities, among other properties.\n   In these models, several chemical enrichment processes are\n   identified. \\\\\n   \\citet{maclow} developed single-phased hydrodynamical models for\n   dwarf galaxies.\n   They model the effects of repeated supernova type II (SNII) explosions\n   from starbursts on the interstellar medium, that is,\n   the enrichment by the ejected metals on the one hand, and\n   the gas loss by supernova winds on the other hand, taking into\n   account the gravitational potential of their dark matter haloes.\n   They find that, in galaxies with gas masses below $10^6~M_{\\odot}$,\n   most of the gas is blown away, and in galaxies with masses between\n   $10^7~M_{\\odot}$ and $10^9~M_{\\odot}$, mainly the newly-formed\n   metal-rich gas is blown away, whereas the already present, metal-poor,\n   gas is retained.\n   They do not calculate the final (present-day) metallicities of their\n   model galaxies, but it is obvious that they remain low-metallicity,\n   at least the ones with gas masses below $10^9~M_{\\odot}$. \\\\\n   \\citet{recchimatta,recchimattb} simulate IZw18, one of the\n   lowest-metallicity galaxies known, using a single star formation\n   burst model and a model with a doubly peaked star formation\n   history.\n   They use a lower SNII heating efficiency than MacLow et al.\n   in their models, but include type Ia supernovae (SNeIa),\n   for which they use a higher heating efficiency.\n   As a consequence, alpha elements are ejected less efficiently\n   than in MacLow et al.'s model, resulting in higher metallicities.\n   The iron-peak elements, which are produced in SNeIa,\n   on the other hand, are still ejected, causing high [$\\alpha$/Fe]\n   ratios.\n   The (gas) metallicity in their single burst model remains very low,\n   [O/H$]\\stackrel{_<}{_\\sim}-1.3$, depending on the galaxy mass.\n   In their (more likely) double burst model, [O/H] can reach values up\n   to -1, depending on the details of the models, that is, the stellar\n   yields used, the stellar initial mass function (IMF), the time between\n   the bursts, the duration of the second burst, the gas density and -\n   metallicity in the star forming region, and the total mass of the\n   stars formed in the second burst.\n   The final metallicities of the double burst model galaxies are\n   between 0.6 and 1 dex higher than after the first burst. \\\\\n   \\citet{tenoriotagle} include photoionisation and cluster wind in\n   their two-dimensional hydrodynamic calculations.\n   They identify two mechanisms:\n   The storage of clouds into a long-lasting ragged shell inhibiting\n   the expansion of the thermalised wind, and the steady filtering of\n   the shocked wind gas through channels carved within the cloud layer.\n   They conclude that both processes must be at work in HII galaxies.\n   Unfortunately, they make no prediction about the present-day metallicity\n   of their model galaxies. \\\\\n   In a series of papers, Recchi and collaborators use a new generation of\n   chemo-dynamical models, some of which include infalling clouds.\n   The first two, \\citet{recchimattc} and \\citet{recchihenslera}, are\n   aimed at reproducing the properties of two specific objects,\n   IZw18 and NGC1569, respectively.\n   The third one, \\citet{recchihenslerb} investigates the influence of\n   several factors, such as the cloudiness of the gas distribution,\n   the IMF slope, and stellar yields.\n   They find that models with continuous low level star formation periods\n   in the past followed by a quiescent phase and a recent, stronger burst\n   best reproduce the chemical properties of the studied galaxies.\n   They also find that, for a homogeneous gas distribution, metals get\n   blown away by galactic winds, but cool infalling intergalactic clouds\n   can hamper these galactic winds.\n   The final metallicities in the their various models vary from\n   -2.5 to -0.8.\n\n   Although metallicity determinations of the various components of\n   HII galaxies cannot discriminate, how much each of these mechanisms\n   contribute to the chemical evolution, they can quantify the\n   metallicity at various stages of a galaxy's evolution, i.e.\n   at the time of the formation of the old ($>1$ Gyr) stellar populations\n   and at present, and thereby help to rule out some of the evolutionary\n   scenarios, and support others.\n   HII galaxies have the advantage that it is possible to determine\n   independently the metallicities of the young and the old populations\n   from their spectra.\n   As the young populations were formed recently out of the same\n   gas that is responsible for the emission lines, their metallicity\n   can be assumed to be more or less the same as the one of the\n   gas, which can be determined from the emission line strengths.\n   The metallicity of the old populations, on the other hand, can be\n   determined from the continuum and absorption features through\n   population synthesis. \\\\\n   The main goal of the present work is to measure the chemical enrichment\n   in a homogeneous sample of HII galaxies, and examine possible\n   trends with galactic properties such as total mass.\n   This way, we can evaluate the different models and make statements\n   on the importance of the various enrichment mechanisms.\n\n   Until recently, the discovery of HII galaxies was limited to the visual\n   inspection of objective-prism surveys, introducing ill-controlled\n   biases and selection effects\n   \\citep*[for compilations, see][and references therein]{terlevich,kehrig}. \\\\\n   The Sloan Digital Sky Survey \\citep*[SDSS;][]{york} presents for the\n   first time a comprehensive database of galactic spectra.\n   Data release 7 \\citep{abazajian} contains over 900'000 galaxy spectra\n   that have been selected on clear magnitude limiting criteria.\n   In an unprecedented manner, the SDSS allows to study star forming emission\n   line galaxies based on clear and quantitative criteria,\n   and not mere visual inspection.\n\n   In this work, we define clear emission line strength criteria to\n   distinguish galaxies containing strongly excited gas from other\n   emission line galaxies.\n   We only include spectra that contain the\n   [OII]~$\\lambda$3727~\\AA\\ emission line, as this line is indispensable\n   for an adequate determination of the gas metallicity.\n   This criterion excludes galaxies with redshift\n   $\\stackrel{_<}{_\\sim} 0.033$.\n   This way, we selected a homogeneous sample of $\\sim 700$ HII galaxy\n   spectra of high quality from the SDSS. \\\\\n   In this sample, we determine the metallicities of both the gas and\n   the old stellar content using emission line calibration\n   and stellar population synthesis methods, respectively.\n   It is the first time an independent metallicity determination\n   of the gas and the stars is performed on a

        "introduction": "From the {\\it IRAS} survey, it was clear that the absorption and re-emission of \nstarlight by interstellar dust in the Milky Way, and of both starlight and accretion energy \nfrom AGN by dust in external galaxies, is a very important process. The thermal emission \nspectrum of dust heated by this radiation, which is observed to peak at a wavelength \nof order 100\\,$\\mu$m, is redshifted into the submm waveband with a very strong \n$K$-correction, making high-redshift submm galaxies unusually easy to detect as \ncompared with their low-redshift counterparts. Between redshifts of about 0.5 and 10 \nthe $K$-correction almost balances the cosmological dimming of a source with a fixed \ntemplate SED, and so the flux density received from a galaxy is approximately\nconstant.\\cite{Hyfest} Although the submm waveband is thus a very attractive window \nfor cosmology,\\cite{BL93} it is technically very challenging to image submm radiation at \nthe faint sensitivity levels -- several mJy at 850\\,$\\mu$m -- required to detect even an \nultraluminous galaxy, defined as possessing a far-infrared(IR) luminosity in excess of \n$10^{12}$\\,L$_\\odot$, at any redshift $z \\ge 0.5$. \n\nSystematic submm-wave cosmology has only been possible since the \ncommissioning of the SCUBA camera at the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in \n1997.\\cite{Holland} A handful of known high-redshift galaxies and \nAGN were detected earlier using single-pixel detectors,\\cite{10214,4C,BR1202} but \nblank-field surveys were impossible, due to a combination of relatively low \nsensitivity and a very small field of view. SCUBA brought 37 and 91 detectors operating \nin the atmospheric windows at 850 and 450\\,$\\mu$m respectively, providing a \n2.5-arcmin field of view, and has been used to good effect to make a range \nof surveys of the high-redshift \nUniverse.\\cite{SIB,Hughes,Barger98,Eales,BCS,PvdW,Chapman} Recently, the MAMBO \ncamera at the IRAM 30-m telescope has also produced deep survey images \nat 1.25\\,mm.\\cite{Bertoldi} The existing BIMA, IRAM, Nobeyama and OVRO interferometer \narrays are very valuable for making sensitive, high-resolution mm-wave observations, \nbut because of their small fields of view, they are not practical survey instruments.

        "question": "What is the approximate Larmor precession frequency of nuclear spins used in experiments searching for axion-like particles with short-range spin-dependent interactions?",
        "introduction": "The Axion Resonant InterAction Detection Experiment (ARIADNE) intends to search for the QCD axion using techniques based on nuclear magnetic resonance \\cite{arv14,ger17}.  Axions or axion-like particles will generically mediate short-range spin-dependent interactions between an ensemble of nuclear spins and an (un-polarized) attractor mass.  In the experiment, a sample of laser-polarized $^3$He nuclear spins feels a fictitious \u201cmagnetic field\u201d as the teeth of a sprocket-shaped tungsten attractor rotate past the sample at the nuclear Larmor precession frequency, set to be approximately 100 Hz \\cite{ger17}. Here the axion is acting as the mediating boson responsible for the interaction.  The experiment has the potential to probe deep within the theoretically interesting regime for the QCD axion in the mass range of 0.01-10 meV, while being independent of cosmological assumptions. Detecting the axion would explain the smallness of $\\theta_{\\rm{QCD}}$ \\cite{axion1, axion2,PTViolation, Moody:1984ba} and identify a component of Dark Matter \\cite{arv14,PTViolation,ADMX}. \n\nThe axion can mediate an interaction between fermions (e.g. nucleons) with a potential given by \\begin{equation}\n U_{sp}(r)=\\frac{\\hbar^2 g_s^N g_p^N}{8 \\pi m_f}\\left( \\frac{1}{r \\lambda_a}+\\frac{1}{r^2}\\right) e^{-\\frac{r}{\\lambda_a}} \\left(\\hat \\sigma \\cdot \\hat r \\right),\n \\end{equation}\n where $m_f$ is their mass, $\\hat{\\sigma}$ is the Pauli spin matrix, $\\vec{r}$ is the vector between them, and $\\lambda_a = h/m_A c$ is the axion Compton wavelength \\cite{Moody:1984ba,arv14}, which determines the range over which the interaction extends. The range of interaction can be as small as $\\lambda=30$ $\\mu$m depending on the mass of the axion \\cite{pdg}. For the QCD axion the scalar and dipole coupling constants $g_s^N$ and $g_p^N$ are directly correlated to the axion mass. Since the axion couples to $\\hat{\\sigma}$ which is proportional to the magnetic moment $\\vec{\\mu}_N$ of the nucleus, the axion coupling can be treated as a fictitious \u201cmagnetic field\u201d $B_{\\rm{eff}}$ through an interaction potential \n \\begin{equation} \n U_{sp}(r)=-\\vec{\\mu}_N \\cdot \\vec{B}_{\\rm{eff}}.\\label{gsgp}\n \\end{equation}\nIn ARIADNE, the fictitious field is generated by a tungsten sprocket. As the teeth of the sprocket rotate past the $^3$He spin sample, the distance between the tungsten material and $^3$He spin sample is modulated, thus resulting in a modulation in the field strength seen by the spins. \n \n It is vital to note that such a magnetic field as described in Eq. (\\ref{gsgp}) does not conform to Maxwell's equations and so cannot be detected directly with a magnetometer such as a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID)\\cite{arv14}. Instead, the nuclear spins in a hyperpolarized sample of $^3$He do couple to the locally-sourced fictitious field, and can precess resonantly with the modulation as in a nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment. This precession allows the fictitious field to be indirectly detected by using a SQUID magnetometer to measure the real magnetic field generated by the precessing $^3$He nuclear spins\\cite{ger17}. The setup relies on superconducting magnetic shielding, required to screen the $^3$He sample from ordinary magnetic noise.  \n\nFor the geometry described in \\citet{ger17} and illustrated in Fig. \\ref{setup}, the fictitious magnetic field felt at the sample is constrained to be very small, less than $10^{-19}$ T. Thus experimental sensitivity is paramount. Under ideal operating conditions the sensitivity of the experiment will be limited by quantum projection noise in the sample itself \\cite{arv14}.  The sensitivity is thus maximized for a longer transverse decoherence time $T_2$ of the sample, with the minimum detectable magnetic field scaling as $(n V T_2)^{-1/2}$ where $n$ is the density of polarized spins in a sample of volume $V$. In practice the experimental sensitivity is constrained by several considerations. The first is ordinary (external) magnetic noise, which would exceed the sub-aT axion signal if unmitigated. A second stems from magnetic field gradients in the sample volume, which result in a Larmor frequency which varies throughout the sample, decreasing the effective $T_2$. Thirdly, the sample's nuclear Larmor precession frequency (set by the overall magnetic field felt by the sample) and the modulation frequency of the axion field set by the sprocket's rotational frequency must be matched in an experimentally practical way.\n\nThe methods presented in this paper may be generally useful for magnetic field control near superconducting boundaries in other experiments where similar considerations apply, even those relying on detecting the cosmological axion field, such as the Casper Axion Dark matter experiment \\cite{casper} or the QUAX proposal \\cite{quax}.\n\n \\begin{figure}[!t]\n\\begin{center}\n\\includegraphics[width=0.8\\columnwidth]{setup.pdf}\n\\caption{Setup: a sprocket-shaped source mass is rotated so its ``teeth'' pass near a laser-polarized $^3$He NMR sample at its resonant frequency, producing a time-varying ``fictitious'' magnetic field via the axion potential.

This distance between the rotating sprocket and He sample is kept within $\\approx 200$ $\\mu$m to search for short-range axion-mediated forces.

        "question": "What property of gamma-ray burst afterglows makes their peak flux theoretically independent of time under adiabatic hydrodynamic evolution?",
        "introduction": "There is now substantial evidence that $\\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs)\noriginate at cosmological distances (e.g. Metzger et al. 1997) from\nvery powerful explosions (e.g. Kulkarni et al. 1998, 1999).  They have\nbeen detected at very high redshifts, making them useful probes of the\nuniverse out to early cosmological epochs.  In addition, the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission is followed by delayed emission at longer\nwavelengths, from the $X$-ray to the radio band (Costa et al. 1997;\nvan Paradijs et al. 1997; Frail et al. 1997).  This afterglow is\ndescribed reasonably well as synchrotron radiation, emitted when a\nrelativistic shell collides with an external medium (Paczy\\'nski \\&\nRhoads 1993; Katz 1994; Waxman 1997a,b; Wijers, Rees \\& M\\'esz\\'aros\n1997; Sari, Piran \\& Narayan 1998). Afterglows, like their high energy\ncounterpart, are also expected to be detected out to very high\nredshift. The absorption-line systems and the Ly$\\alpha$ forest\nvisible in their spectra can therefore be used to trace the evolution\nof metallicity in the universe, and to constrain, or possibly measure,\nthe epoch at which re-ionization of the universe occurred (e.g.  Lamb\n\\& Reichart 2000).\n\nIn this {\\em Letter} we point out other uses that multi-wavelength\nobservations of afterglows might have in cosmology. Whereas it is by\nnow clear that GRBs (and consequently their afterglows) are far from\nbeing standard candles, the afterglows do have a very interesting\nproperty: the flux at the peak of the synchrotron spectrum is\nindependent of time for adiabatic hydrodynamic evolution (Katz 1994;\nM\\'esz\\'aros \\& Rees 1997; Sari, Piran \\& Narayan 1998), and the\nadiabatic shock model has received robust support from observations\n(Waxman 1997a,b).  Because the frequency of the peak flux smoothly\ndecreases with time, this provides a strong theoretical connection\nbetween observations at various widely-separated frequencies which is\nlacking in other high-$z$ objects such as quasars or galaxies.\n\nThis property makes GRB afterglows well suited to absorption studies\nof both the GRB immediate environment and host galaxy, and of the\nintervening intergalactic medium (IGM).  One such possibility is the\nstudy of intergalactic dust, which may play a role in observations of\nhigh-$z$ Supernovae (SNe).  In the past few years, observations of\nType Ia SNe by two separate groups have revealed a progressive dimming\nof SNe at high redshift with respect to the predictions of a\nmatter-dominated universe or even an open universe with a zero\ncosmological constant (Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter et al. 1998).\nThis dimming has been interpreted as evidence for acceleration in the\ncosmic expansion, probably caused by a positive cosmological constant.\nTwo important systematic effects which must be accounted for in\ndrawing this conclusion are evolution in the supernova intrinsic\nbrightness and dust obscuration; both groups have discussed these at\nlength. However, their dust corrections, based on reddening, rely on\nthe assumption that dust has everywhere the same characteristics as in\nthe Milky Way, which might not be the case.  As Aguirre (1999) has\nshown, a scenario in which galaxies expel a significant fraction of\ntheir metals in winds or by radiation pressure ejection of dust, and\nin which very small grains are selectively destroyed or retained by\ngalaxies, can self-consistently provide a viable candidate for an\nintergalactic (IG) dust component which is more 'grey' (i.e. less\nreddening) than dust in the Milky Way. Dust reddening properties also\nvary significantly within and between galaxies.\n \nGRB afterglows are observed in widely-separated bands at which even\ngrey dust will attenuate radiation very differently, and, as explained\nabove, a known relation exist between the expected fluxes in those\nbands in the absence of extinction. This {\\em Letter} shows that,\ngiven a sample of GRB afterglows for which a reliable correction for\nthe host galaxy absorption has been made, a comparison between the\nnumber count distribution of peak fluxes in various bands can\nsensitively test the presence of a cosmological distribution of grey\ndust. Whereas this test is insensitive to \nthe choice of model parameters made, such as type of cosmology,\nshape of the GRB luminosity function, redshift evolution of the GRB rate,\netc. (because these parameters influence in the {\\em same} way\nthe number counts in all bands, and we are {\\em\ncomparing} data in different bands), it does\n rely on the assumption of the constancy of the\npeak flux in the various bands. In reality, several effects \ncan contribute to a departure from the simple, ideal behavior\n(see e.g. Meszaros, Rees \\& Wijers 1998), and we discuss how\nand to what extent these can be corrected for, so that our test\nwould still remain possible.\n\nBesides probing the existence of IG dust, we show that the same type\nof multi-wavelength study of GRB afterglows can provide a useful probe\nof the evolution of metallicity (or dust-to-gas ratio) in the\nGRB-forming regions of galaxies.  Independent probes of metallicity\nevolution (i.e. not related to GRB sites) can then yield information\non the specific environments of GRBs in relation to galaxies, helping\nto elucidate the nature GRB progenitors. Conversely, assuming a GRB\nprogenitor type, one could obtain information about dust in the\nenvironment of that type of object, at very high $z$."

Nevertheless, \\cite{soria07}\nsuggested that some ULXs are consistent with black holes accreting at moderate rate with masses of ${\\approx}50-100{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$.\n\nThe study of the timing properties of ULXs represent a promising way to confirm the associations/similarities with this \nclass of sources and BHBs. The Power Density Spectra (PDS) of BHBs are usually composed by broad noise components \nand narrow components (quasi periodic oscillations, QPOs). Just a few ULXs show a QPO and their detection has been proven \nto be difficult (\\cite{heil09}). In this work we apply a recent tool (from \\cite{munoz11}), the Root Mean Square (rms)-Intensity Diagram, which \nhas been proved to be useful to map states in BHBs (without the need of any spectral information).\n\nWe studied the currently best available dataset from the ULX in the dwarf galaxy NGC~5408, located at a distance of \n${\\rm D}=4.8$\\,Mpc (\\cite{karachentsev02}). NGC~5408 X--1 is very bright, with a peak X-ray luminosity in the (0.3-10\\,keV) \nenergy range of ${\\rm L}_{\\rm X}=2{\\times}10^{40}\\,{\\rm erg}\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}$. \\cite{strohmayer09}\nfound a QPO in its PDS centred at $0.01$\\,Hz and inferred a mass\nfor the black hole in the range of $10^{3}-10^{4}\\,{\\rm M}_{\\odot}$. Recently, \\cite{dheeraj12} studied the timing and\nspectral properties of NGC~5408 X--1 and have found that the QPO frequency is variable and largely independent on the spectral \nparameters. They suggested that NGC~5408 X--1 is accreting in the {\\it saturation} (constancy of the power-law photon index\nand disc flux with a further increase in the QPO centroid frequency) {\\it regime} a few times observed in BHBs (\\cite{vignarca03}). We performed \ntiming and spectral studies, but focusing on the evolution of the broad-band noise rather than on the characteristics of the QPO."

        "question": "What is the typical pitch angle of spiral arms in the outer regions of the Milky Way galaxy?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\nHistorically, neutral hydrogen (\\HI) in the disk of the fourth quadrant of\nthe Milky Way has been understudied.  The last fully sampled survey of this\nregion was made with the Parkes 18m Radiotelescope in the 1970's with an\nangular resolution of 48\\arcmin\\ \\citep{kerr86}.  Recently the International\nGalactic Plane Survey \\citep{taylor03,mcgriff01a} consortium has\nundertaken a large-scale project to produce a fully sampled survey of the\nGalactic plane with one arcminute resolution.  For the fourth quadrant, in\nparticular, the Southern Galactic Plane Survey \\citep[SGPS;][]{mcgriff01a}\nconstitutes more than an order of magnitude improvement in angular resolution\nover previous surveys.\n\nIn the Southern Milky Way little is known about the full extent of the \\HI\\\ndisk and the shape of the \\HI\\ density fall-off with Galactic radius.\n\\citet*{knapp78} made an ambitious attempt to measure the full extent of the\n\\HI\\ disk.  The idea behind their work was that for very large radii the\nradial velocity of the gas approaches the projection of the local standard\nof rest (LSR) velocity, $\\Theta_0$, onto the line of sight.  For an extended\ndisk of \\HI\\ there should be a pile-up of gas at $v_{LSR} = \\Theta_0 |\\sin\nl|$.  Despite several very deep integrations, \\citet{knapp78} did not detect\na pile-up.  Subsequent attempts, including a recent one with the Green Bank\nTelescope, have also failed to detect any significant pile-up of gas at\nextreme velocities \\citep*{lockman02}.\n\nThe outer disks of large spiral galaxies occasionally show clear \\HI\\\nspiral arms extending to galactic radii in excess of 30 kpc, while the\nstellar arms stop at radii of $\\sim 10$ kpc.  A classic example is\nM83, where the \\HI\\ spiral arms extend three times as far as the\nstellar arms \\citep{tilanus93}.  Unfortunately, the positions of the\n\\HI\\ spiral arms in the outer Milky Way are not well known.  Early\nstudies of Galactic spiral structure suggest possible arms out to\ndistances of 20 kpc or more.  In particular, the \\citet{kerr69a}\nlatitude-velocity diagrams show a ridge of \\HI\\ in the fourth quadrant\nat extreme positive velocities.  \\citet{kerr69b} maps this feature as\na non-continuous spiral arm from $l=210\\arcdeg$ to $l=290\\arcdeg$.\n\\citet{davies72} also interpreted the low longitude ($l\\lesssim\n260\\arcdeg$) end of this feature as an outer spiral arm, possibly\nassociated with high-velocity clouds.  Despite these early studies,\nthere has been very little interpretation of this ridge and no\ndiscussion of it beyond $l=290\\arcdeg$.\n\nHere we present new data from the SGPS on this extreme positive\nvelocity ridge from $l=260\\arcdeg$ to $l=330\\arcdeg$ and discuss its\nstructure. We argue that it is a cohesive structure and interpret it\nas a distant \\HI\\ spiral arm at the edge of the Milky Way.  Using a\nsimple Galactic spiral model, we show that the shape is well-fit by a\nspiral arm with a pitch angle of $i \\sim 9\\arcdeg$."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the concentration parameter and virial mass of dark matter halos, and how does it vary across different mass scales from galaxies to galaxy clusters?",
        "introduction": "\\label{intro}\n\nThe current cosmological paradigm of a flat universe with low matter\ndensity (\\omegam) consisting of Cold Dark Matter (CDM) and dark energy\nhas become established recently through a variety of astronomical\nobservations, especially the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB),\nsupernova Hubble diagram, and statistics of large galaxy surveys\n\\citep[e.g.,][]{sper03a,asti06a,sper06a}. These key techniques probe the\nlarge-scale, high-redshift universe where the development of cosmic\nstructure may be studied in the linear clustering regime ($\\delta\\ll\n1$). Although the standard model appears to have withstood every test\nthus far \\citep[e.g.,][]{prim06a}, testing the \\lcdm\\ model on small\nscales, fully into the non-linear regime ($\\delta\\gg 1$), will further\nour understanding of galaxy formation and evolution and may also\nrefine the fundamental parameters of the world model itself.  \n\nThe dark matter halos of galaxies and clusters are the largest\nvirialized manifestations of small-scale, non-linear clustering.  An\nimportant probe of the structure of dark matter halos is the\nrelationship between concentration and virial mass.  The concentration\nparameter is defined as, $c\\equiv r_{\\Delta}/r_s$, where $r_{\\Delta}$\n-- the ``virial radius'' -- is usually taken to be the radius within\nwhich the average density equals $\\Delta\\rho_c$, where $\\rho_c$ is the\ncritical density of the universe, and $\\Delta$ is a number typically\nbetween $100-500$. The quantity $r_s$ is the scale radius of the NFW\nprofile \\citep{nfw}, but it is replaced by $r_{-2}$, the radius where\nthe logarithmic density slope equals -2, for more general profiles\n\\citep[][]{nava04a,grah06a}. The virial mass ($M$) is the mass\nenclosed within $r_{\\Delta}$.\n\nN-body simulations of CDM models find that $c$ declines slowly with\nincreasing $M$ but with substantial intrinsic scatter, independent of\n$M$ (\\citealt{bull01a}, hereafter B01; \\citealt{dola04a}, hereafter\nD04; \\citealt{kuhl05a,shaw06a,macc06a}). For a given $M$ the value of\n$c$ in CDM models varies significantly with changes in cosmological\nparameters, particularly the normalization \\sige, \\omegam, and $w$,\nthe parameter representing the dark energy equation of state\n(\\citealt{eke01a,alam02a}; D04; \\citealt{kuhl05a}). The amount of\nintrinsic scatter in the $c-M$ relation is a robust prediction of CDM\nmodels, though preferentially selecting relaxed, early forming systems\nyields smaller scatter than for the entire halo population\n\\citep{jing00a,wech02a,macc06a}.\n\nThe expected decrease of $c$ with increasing $M$ in CDM models has yet\nto be confirmed by observations. Optical studies of groups and\nclusters ($M>10^{13}\\msun$) using several different techniques --\ngalaxy dynamics \\citep{bivi06a,loka06a}, redshift-space caustics\n\\citep{rine06a}, and weak gravitational lensing \\citep{mand06a} -- all\nare consistent with no variation in $c$. However, the $c-M$ relations\nobtained by these studies are consistent with the concordance \\lcdm\\\nmodel.\n\nX-ray studies of the $c-M$ relation using data from the \\asca\\\nsatellite \\citep{wu00a,sato00a} found, $c\\sim M_{200}^{-0.5}$, much\nsteeper than produced in CDM models (B01; D04; \\citealt{macc06a}).\nHowever, it has only become possible with data from the \\chandra\\ and\n\\xmm\\ satellites to obtain spatially resolved temperature measurements\nof sufficient quality for reliable X-ray constraints on the mass\nprofiles of elliptical galaxies, galaxy groups, and clusters\n\\citep[e.g., see reviews by][and references therein]{buot03d,arna05a}.\nIndeed, our recent study of the mass profiles of seven early-type\ngalaxies with \\chandra\\ indicates $c-M$ values consistent with \\lcdm\\\n\\citep{hump06b}. The $c-M$ relations for clusters ($M>10^{14}\\msun$)\nobtained using \\xmm\\ \\citep{poin05a} and \\chandra\\ \\citep{vikh06a}\neach are consistent with no variation in $c$ and with the gentle\ndecline with increasing $M$ expected for CDM models. In each case the\nscatter in $\\logten\\ c$ about the mean relation is not well\nconstrained and is consistent with the CDM prediction.\n\nOur present investigation aims to improve significantly the\nconstraints on the $c-M$ relation by analyzing a wider mass range with\nmany more systems than the previous \\chandra\\ and \\xmm\\ studies.  For\nthis purpose we undertook a program to obtain accurate mass\nconstraints on relaxed systems with $10^{12}\\la M \\la 10^{14}\\msun$,\nrepresenting 24 individual early-type galaxies and galaxy\ngroups/clusters, each of which possesses high-quality \\chandra\\ and/or\n\\xmm\\ data \\citep{hump06b,gast06a,zapp06a}.  To these systems we added\nresults for 15 relaxed, massive clusters from \\citet{poin05a} and\n\\citet{vikh06a}. Using this combined sample, optimized for X-ray mass\nmeasurements, we obtain empirical constraints on the local $c-M$\nrelation with a simple power-law model and compare this model to the\npredictions of a suite of CDM models.\n\nWe note that the primary purpose of this paper is to assemble accurate\n$c-M$ measurements from \\chandra\\ and \\xmm\\ observations from galaxy\nto cluster scales and to test whether $c$ decreases with increasing\n$M$ similar to that predicted by CDM models. However, we also make an\ninitial attempt to constrain the parameters of CDM models to examine\nthe efficacy of the $c-M$ relation in this regard and to highlight\nsources of systematic error both in the models and data that need to\nbe addressed with future studies.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. We describe the X-ray $c$ and $M$\nmeasurements in \\S \\ref{obs}. Our procedure for fitting a power-law\nmodel to the $c-M$ data is discussed in \\S \\ref{method}. We define the\ncosmological models that are compared to the X-ray data in \\S\n\\ref{models}. We present our results in \\S \\ref{results} and discuss\nsources of systematic error in \\S \\ref{sys}. In \\S \\ref{conc} we give\nour conclusions.  All distance-related quantities, unless stated\notherwise, are computed assuming a flat universe with $\\omegam=0.3$,\n$\\omegalambda=0.7$, and $H_0=100h$~\\kmsmpc\\ with $h=0.7$."

        "question": "At what approximate distance from the Sun do cometary nuclei begin to experience significant sublimation of water ice?",
        "introduction": "Cometary nuclei are the most primitive objects in the solar\nsystem. Within about 3 AU of the sun, solar heating causes the surface\ntemperature of the nucleus to rise above 200 K; water ice sublimes and\nother volatiles and icy dust grains are expelled from the surface. The\nmotion, chemistry and rate of sublimation of molecules from the icy\ngrains are influenced by the solar wind and solar radiation. Initially\nthe escaping gases form a dynamic, gravitationally-unbound atmosphere,\nthe coma. They are subsequently swept into the comet's plasma and dust\ntails and eventually dissipate into interplanetary space. The surface\nof the nucleus is processed during the course of repeated visits to\nthe inner solar system, becoming covered with a rubble blanket of\nparticles too large to be dragged away by escaping gas. During the\ncourse of numerous perihelia, the outer surface becomes completely\ndepleted of volatile materials which either escape from the surface or\nelse migrate inwards. This creates an outer mantle of siliceous dust\n(Huebner, 2008), above a layered structure in which the more volatile\nspecies are found at greater depths (Prialnik et al., 2008). This\nstructure results in the great variety that is observed in active\ncomets.\n\nCometary nuclei typically have radii of $\\sim$3 km and are not able to\nbe resolved from Earth. During close approaches, the inner coma of\nsome comets are resolvable with large terrestrial\ninstruments. However, in general, data obtained with Earth-based\ninstruments are indicative of conditions in a wider region of the\ncoma, and our understanding of conditions within the inner coma (a\nregion extending up to a few hundred km, where energy transfer is\ncollisionally-dominated, relies largely on modelling. Our\nunderstanding of the more extended regions of the coma, where the\ndensities of the species are too low for thermodynamic equilibrium to\nexist, also relies on modelling. In particular, models of cometary\ncoma predict the existence of so-called `solar pumped fluorescent'\n(SPF) H$_2$O emission lines. These originate from ro-vibrational\nexcited upper states of the molecule, which, if observed in a\ncollisionally-dominated region would be characteristic of kinetic\ntemperatures of several thousand K, but are able to be produced in the\ncold, rarefied conditions existing in cometary coma, since these\nexcited states, which have relatively large Einstein A coefficients,\nhave time to decay radiatively before they are de-excited by collision\nwith another molecule.\n\nDespite the success of models in predicting SPF lines (Crovisier,\n1984; Weaver and Mumma, 1984, Mumma et al., 1995), the physical\nconditions existing in cometary coma are highly complex and recent\nobservations of Comet Tempel 1 (Barber et al., 2007) revealed a type\nof emission line, not previously recorded in cometary spectra, and not\npredicted by the existing cometary models. These so-called `SH' lines\noriginate from upper states that are excited to higher vibrational\nenergies than are the upper states of the SPF lines. Consequently,\ntheir production mechanisms are not able to be explained simply, by\nthe existing cometary models. The near-Earth approach of Comet\n8P/Tuttle in January 2008, provided an opportunity for us to search\nfor, assign and characterise SH emission lines in its coma. We believe\nthat our findings, which are presented in this paper, provide the\nbasis for a more thorough investigation of the physical processes\ninvolved in the production of SH lines in cometary coma."

Detailed reviews of GW sources, of the expected event rates,\nand of the physics that these sources could teach us are available\nelsewhere,\\cite{Ferrari,Hughes,Kip} but I shall list briefly the most\npromising astrophysical systems from which we could learn about NSs\nusing Earth-based GW interferometers such as LIGO and VIRGO.\n\\begin{enumerate}\n\\item \\emph{NS--NS and NS--BH binaries in the last few minutes of\ntheir inspirals.}  For a long time, these inspiraling systems have been\nthe prototype for the category of the short-lived \\emph{chirp} signals detectable using Earth-based interferometers. The reason, of course,\nis that NS--NS binaries have actually been observed in our\ngalaxy,\\cite{Thorsett} but also that the part of the inspiral\naccessible to the interferometers (with GW frequencies between 40 and\n1000 Hz) sits well before the final merger of the binary, so it is\ndescribed very accurately by the well-developed post--Newtonian\nequations for point masses.\\cite{Blanchet} The successful\nobservation of GWs from these events will teach us about the masses,\nspins and locations of NSs, but not about their internal structure.\n\nOn the contrary, the detection of GW from the endpoint of NS--BH inspirals should produce detailed information about NS structure and EOS. For a wide range of binary parameters, the NS will be torn apart by the tidal field of the BH well before the final plunge into the hole, and the tidal-disruption waves will be well inside the frequency range of good interferometer sensitivity.\\cite{Vallisneri} NS--BH binaries have also been proposed as engines for gamma-ray bursts\\cite{Janka} and as suitable environments for the production of heavy nuclei in $r$-processes.\\cite{Lee} I will discuss these systems more extensively in \\mbox{Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:tidal}} of this paper.\n\\item \\emph{Rapidly spinning, deformed NSs.}  This class includes the\nknown and unknown radio pulsars (when their gravitational\nellipticity is high enough to provide strong GWs), and the systems\nknown as low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXB), where the NS is accreting\nmatter and angular momentum from a companion, but instead of\nincreasing its rotation, it is locked into spin periods of about 3 ms;\nit is conjectured that the angular momentum being accreted is\nlost to the emission of GW.\\cite{Bildsten}\n\nTo detect rapidly spinning NSs, it\nwill be necessary to integrate the GW signal for times up to several\nmonths, so the Doppler frequency modulation caused by the movement of\nthe Earth around the sun will make it much harder to detect previously\nunknown sources.\\cite{Brady} At the same time, the shape of this\nmodulation will make it possible to obtain the position of the source\nin the sky,\\cite{Jaranowski} and to match the GW source with one of\nthe objects known from electromagnetic observations.\n\nIf any GWs are detected, their features would be very informative, in particular when examined in correlation with electromagnetic signals from the same source. For instance, the ratio of the GW frequency to the NS angular frequency could identify the nature of the inhomogeneities that give rise to the GW emission, and the evolution of the GW amplitude and frequency could provide interesting data about NS physics such as crust structure and dynamics, crust--core interactions, magnetic fields, viscosity, superfluidity, and more.\\cite{Kip}\n\\item \\emph{Proto-neutron stars.}  Finally, NSs could be\nobserved as the rapidly spinning, strongly asymmetric remnants of\nstellar-core collapse, or as the proto--NSs produced by the\naccretion-induced collapse of white dwarves. Proto--NSs that\nspin very fast can hang up centrifugally at a stage where their radius\nis still large compared to that of the final NS. Such a\nconfiguration might be unstable to a bar mode, giving rise to an\nelongated object that would emit very strong GWs.\\cite{bars}\nThe newborn NSs might also develop a GW-induced instability in\ntheir $r$-modes.\\cite{Lindblom,Kokkotas} I will discuss this\npossibility more extensively in Sec.\\ \\ref{sec:rmode}.\n\nFor all these systems, GWs would provide information complementary to that made available by neutrino observations, focusing on the density structure and asymmetry of the collapsing core rather than on its thermal structure.\n\\end{enumerate}\n\n\\noindent While we wait eagerly for the first detections, numerical\nsimulations of GW sources are beginning to provide precious insight into\nthe effect of NS structure and dynamics on the GW\nsignals.

The thermal state of the IGM is also\nan important \\lq nuisance\\rq\\ factor when using the Lyman-$\\alpha$\nforest to study the nature of the dark matter \\citep{boyarsky2009}, or\nto determine the amplitude of the UV-background \\citep{bolton2005}.\n\n\\cite{schaye1999} described a method for inferring $(T_0,\\gamma)$ from the line width versus column density ($b-N_{\\rm HI}$) scatter plot of Lyman-$\\alpha$ lines, when the Lyman-$\\alpha$ forest is fitted as a sum of Voigt profiles for example using {\\sc vpfit}\\footnote{{\\sc vpfit} is developed by R. Carswell and J. Webb, http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/\\~rfc/vpfit.html.}. This improved and extended the work of \\cite{theuns1998} who had noted that the small $b$ cut-off of the $b$-parameter distribution was sensitive to temperature. \\cite{schaye2000}, and \\cite{ricotti2000, bryan2000} and \\cite{mcdonald2001}\nused this to measure the $T-\\rho$ relation at redshifts $z\\sim 2-4$.\n\nSince then other measurements have been performed over a larger redshift\nrange, some also based on Voigt profile fitting \\citep{rudie2012},\nor based on small-scale power spectrum or wavelet analysis \\citep{theuns2000a,\n  mcdonald2000, zaldarriaga2001, theuns2002b, viel2009,\n  lidz2010,garzilli2012}, transmission PDF statistics\n\\citep{bolton2008, viel2009, calura2012, garzilli2012} and more\nrecently on curvature statistics \\citep{becker2011}. Current\nmeasurements still have large error bars for $T_0$ and constraints are\neven poorer for $\\gamma$. \\cite{bolton2008} and \\cite{viel2009} even\nargue that $\\gamma<1$, which is difficult to understand from a\ntheoretical point of view \\citep{mcquinn2009, compostella2013}.\n\nThe basis for all these methods is the assumption that line widths are relatively directly related to the temperature of the absorbing gas. However, it is in fact well known that - in the simulations - the absorption lines are invariably wider than just the thermal broadening. In addition there is a very large {\\em scatter} in line widths at a given density, in the sense that some lines are {\\em much} wider than the thermal width at a given density.\n\n\nIn this paper we present a new model for measuring and interpreting\nline widths, which builds on previous work. In our model lines\nare {\\em always} broader that the thermal width, and we also explain the\norigin of the large scatter. We describe how the model can be used to\ninfer not just $T_0$ and $\\gamma$, but also to constrain the size of\nthe absorbers. This paper is organised as follows. In Section~2 we begin by contrasting the \\lq fluctuating Gunn-Peterson\\rq\\ description of the IGM with one where the absorption is due to a distribution of individual absorbers. We do so in order to establish notation and explain the motivation for our modelling. We discuss the properties of these absorbers, and in particular what sets their line widths. In Section~3 we introduce the simulations and use them to test the basic assumptions of the model. In Section~4 we examine whether the method can in principle be applied to observables.\nWe present a summary of our conclusions in Section~5."

        "question": "What is the primary mechanism responsible for the rotation of circumstellar disks around Be stars?",
        "introduction": "Be stars are non-supergiant, early-type stars with a circumstellar (CS) disk that is created from matter ejected from the star. Recent observational facts brought by spectro-interferometry and spectro-astrometry \\citep[e.g.][]{2012A&A...538A.110M,2012MNRAS.423L..11W} supports the fact that so far all studied Be star disks rotate in a Keplerian fashion. This characteristic, together with other observational signatures of the disk outlined in \\cite{2011IAUS..272..325C}, are properties that only the viscous decretion disk  (VDD) model can reproduce. This model, first suggested by \\cite{1991MNRAS.250..432L} and further developed by \\citet{1997LNP...497..239B}, \\citet{1999A&A...348..512P}, \\citet{2001PASJ...53..119O}, \\citet{2005ASPC..337...75B} and \\citet{2008MNRAS.386.1922J}, among others, uses the angular momentum transport by turbulent viscosity to lift material into higher orbits, thereby causing the disk to grow in size. This model has already been successfully applied to systems showing stable continuum emission: e.g. $\\zeta$ Tauri \\citep{car09}, $\\chi$\\,Oph \\citep{2008ApJ...689..461T} and $\\beta$\\,CMi \\citep{2012MNRAS.423L..11W} and systems exhibiting a more variable photometric activity \\citep[28\\,CMa,][]{2012ApJ...744L..15C}.  In a recent review paper, \\cite{rev2013} discuss in detail the observational and theoretical evidences in support of the VDD scenario for Be stars.\n\nPolarization is a powerful tool to study the geometry of the disk (opening angle, flaring) of Be stars without angularly resolving it. Polarized flux originates from electron scattering off the disk, and is affected by both pre- and post-scattering absorption by \\ion{H}{1} atoms \\citep{wood96b,2013ApJ...765...17H}. Since \\ion{H}{1} opacity depends on the physical state of the gas, studying polarimetric observables at different wavelengths allows one to probe different regions of the disk. In the literature, the polarimetric technique has an established history of providing a unique diagnosis in identifying and studying the detailed CS environments of Be stars \\citep[][]{1997ApJ...477..926W,2007ApJ...671L..49C,car09,2010ApJ...709.1306W,2011ApJ...728L..40D}.\n\nHaubois et al. (2012), hereafter Paper I, studied the temporal variability of Be disks, based on {\\sc singlebe} VDD hydrodynamics simulations  \\citep{2007ASPC..361..230O}. {\\sc singlebe} solves the 1-D surface density evolution equation for a viscous isothermal Keplerian decretion disk. The effects of variable mass injection rates on the disk structure, and their corresponding effect on the photometry, were studied at different wavelengths and compared to observations. More specifically, we first studied the different timescales that characterize the evolution of the disk surface density and how this surface density responds to changes in the mass injection rates. These surface density profiles were used as inputs to the three-dimensional non-LTE Monte Carlo radiative transfer code {\\sc hdust}  \\citep{car06,2008ApJ...684.1374C} that allowed the calculation of photometric observables at various wavelengths. The characteristic shapes of these lightcurves agree qualitatively well with observations, which provide strong circumstantial evidence that viscosity is indeed the mechanism that redistributes matter along the CS disk. The first successful confrontation of theoretical VDD lightcurves with observations was done by \\cite{2012ApJ...744L..15C} for the Be star 28\\,CMa.\nTo summarize, Paper I  provides the reader with a description of the photometric variability from a Be star in the framework of the VDD model. With the present paper, we aim at  exploring the variability of the  \\emph{continuum} polarimetric features in the same manner.\n\n%We then computed lightcurves for Be stars subject to different mass loss rate histories and studied how the lightcurves depended on the other system parameters. \n \nIn \\S\u00f7\\ref{origin}, we describe the polarigenic mechanisms operating in Be disks. Then we present the dynamical models we investigated and their signatures on common continuum polarimetric observables. We also show the diagnosis potential of a series of diagrams that we named polarization color diagrams (PCDs) that represent a powerful tool to follow the mass injection history in Be stars (\\S\u00f7\\ref{prediction}). Finally, a discussion and a comparison to observed data of these synthetic observables are presented in \\S\u00f7\\ref{comp} before concluding.\n\n%mass injection = (mass ejected from the central star and injected into the disk)"

        "introduction": "In recent studies of galaxy formation and evolution, the most massive and luminous galaxies have played a \nleading role. Most luminous galaxies, such as submillimetre galaxies and ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs\\footnote{Galaxies with a total infrared (8 -- 1000\\,$\\mu$m) luminosity of 10$^{12\\mathrm{-}13}$\\,L\\,$_\\odot$.}) \nat high redshifts are now believed to be the progenitors of massive spheroids, and highlight the early formation \nof massive galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{2004ApJ...616...71S,2005ApJ...622..772C,2008ApJ...680..246T}. This supports the scenario of anti-hierarchical or `down-sizing' galaxy formation \\citep[e.g.][]{2004Natur.428..625H,2006A&A...453L..29C}. \n\nMid-infrared (IR) surveys are a powerful tool for studying the most luminous galaxies at high redshifts, by \nproviding the infrared luminosity function and the star formation rate in a large \ncosmic volume as a function of redshift \\citep[e.g][]{2005ApJ...630...82P,2005ApJ...632..169L,2006MNRAS.370.1159B,2007ApJ...660...97C,Goto_LF}. \nHowever, this work can suffer uncertainty from the $k$-correction, which requires knowing the \nappropriate mid-IR spectral energy \ndistribution (SED). %\nIn fact, sensitive IRS observations with the Spitzer Space Telescope reveal that the mid-IR spectra of submillimetre galaxies resembles that of over 2 orders of magnitude less luminous starburst galaxies  \\citep{2007ApJ...660.1060V,2008ApJ...675.1171P,2008ApJ...677..957F},  \nwhich have prominent emission features of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).\nThis raises questions about  the nature of most luminous galaxies, and how they differ systematically from low-$z$ to high-$z$. \n\nMulti-wavelength mid-IR surveys with AKARI provide a unique\nmeasure of the mid-IR properties of infrared galaxies at high redshifts with a statistically valid sample. \n\\cite{2007PASJ...59S.557T} demonstrate that AKARI/IRC all-band photometry is capable of \nidentifying the approximate spectral shape of the PAH emission, specifically the steep rise of flux at \nthe blue side of the PAH 6.2\\,$\\mu$m feature. \nSuch a steep flux rise can only be accounted for by PAH emission. Using this fact, we propose a new photometric selection method for galaxies whose mid-IR emission is dominated by PAH emission. This is possible if photometric observations are sufficiently comprehensive enough to trace the PAH  emission feature in the SED, as in the AKARI/IRC all-band photometric survey. We call galaxies selected in this method PAH-selected galaxies. \n\nIn this paper, we utilize the multi-wavelength mid-IR coverage of the NEP-Deep survey with AKARI, in order to \nidentify galaxies with strong PAH emission. Sections 2 and 3 describe the data and sample selection, respectively. Our SED-fitting method using the optical to mid-IR wavelength range, and its results are presented in section 4.

        "question": "What observational evidence challenges the wind-regulation mechanism proposed in the single degenerate model for Type Ia supernovae?",
        "introduction": "\\label{ss.intro}\nSupernovae (SNe) play a central role in astrophysics, not only as\ndistance indicators for cosmology (e.g., Riess et al. 1998; Perlmutter\net al. 1999), but as prime synthesizers of heavy\nelements (e.g. Woosley 2007), \nsources of kinetic energy, and accelerators of cosmic rays\n(e.g. Helder et al. 2009). \nHowever, many of the most basic facts about these events are still\npoorly understood.  \nType-Ia SNe (SNe~Ia), the subject of this review, are linked by indirect\nevidence to the thermonuclear detonations of  carbon-oxygen white\ndwarfs (WDs) whose masses have grown to near the Chandrasekhar limit\n(Hoyle \\& Fowler 1960). However,\ncompeting scenarios exist for the initial conditions and evolutionary \npaths that lead to this mass growth. In the single degenerate (SD)\nmodel (Whelan \\& Iben 1974), a WD grows in mass through accretion from\na non-degenerate stellar companion. The \ndouble degenerate (DD) scenario, on the other hand, was first proposed\nin the landmark paper by Ron (Webbink 1984), the same \npaper we have seen referenced in so many of the talks at this meeting,\non so many different topics. (The same idea was proposed simultaneously by  \nIben \\& Tutukov 1984). In this scenario, \ntwo WDs merge after losing energy and \nangular momentum to gravitational waves. To cite Ron in the abstract of\nthat paper:\n``C/O-C/O pairs are again unstable to dynamical time-scale mass\ntransfer and, since their masses exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, are\ndestined to become SNe''.\n\nAlthough 27 years have passed, \n neither the SD nor the DD models can yet be excluded observationally (nor clearly\n favored), and hence we find ourselves in an embarassing situation: \nthese explosions are of the utmost astrophysical importance, we use \nthem to reach radical conclusions about the existence and properties\nof dark energy, and yet we do not even know for sure {\\it what} is exploding!\nIndeed, the recent Astronomy and Astrophysics \nDecadal Survey\n (\\url{http://sites.nationalacademies.org/bpa/BPA_049810}) \nhas listed \ndetermining the nature of SN Ia progenitors as one of the major\nobjectives of the coming decade.\nApart from the wide-open progenitor question,\n many questions remain  \nregarding the subsequent phases: the details of the probably multiple\naccretion episodes; the enigmatic common-envelope phase; the\ntype and the location of the ignition; the nature of the combustion -- \ndeflagration, detonation, or both; and within all of these details,\nthe eventual causes of the regularities, trends, and environmental\ndependences observed in SN Ia light curves and spectra (see, e.g., the\nrecent review by Howell 2010). Interestingly, even the\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass conjecture has come under renewed scrutiny.\nSub-Chandrasekhar explosions have been proposed as a way of explaining\nsome, or perhaps even most SN Ia events (Raskin et al. 2009; Rosswog et\nal. 2009; Sim et al. 2010; van Kekwijk, Chang \\& Justham\n2010). Conversely, the Ni mass deduced for some SN Ia explosions is\nstrongly suggestive of a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor\n (e.g. Tanaka et al. 2010; Silverman et al. 2010).\n\nBoth the SD and the DD models suffer from numerous problems, both\ntheoretical and observational. In terms of SD theory, it has long been \nrecognized that the mass accretion rate on to the WD needs to be\nwithin a narrow range, in order to attain stable hydrogen burning on the\nsurface, and mass growth toward the Chandrasekhar mass. \nToo-low an accretion rate will lead to explosive\nignition of the accreted hydrogen layer in a nova event, which likely\nblows away more material from the WD than was gained (e.g. Townsley\n\\& Bildsten 2005). Too-high an\naccretion rate will lead to the escape of the accreted material in a\nwind. The self-regulation of the accretion flow by the wind from the\ncompanion, as conceived by Hachisu \\& Nomoto (e.g. Hachisu et al. 1999) has\nthus long been considered to be an essential element of the SD model. \nQuestions, however, have been raised as to whether \nthe mechanism does not \nrequire too much fine tuning (Cassisi et al. 1998; Piersanti et\nal. 2000; Shen \\& Bildsten 2007).\n\nThe SD model faces additional obstacles when it comes to observational\nsearches for its signatures. Badenes et al. (2007) searched seven\nyoung SN Ia remnants for the wind-blown cavities that would be\nexpected in the wind-regulation picture. Instead, in every case it\nappeared the remnant is expanding into a constant-density ISM. Leonard\n(2007) obtained deep spectroscopy in the late nebular phase of several SNe\nIa, in search of the trace amounts of H or He that would be expected\nfrom the stellar winds. None was found. Prieto et al. (2008) have\npointed out the SNe Ia have been observed in galaxies with quite low \nmetallicities. This may run counter to the expectations that, at low\nenough metallicities, the optical depth of the wind would become\nsmall, and the hence the wind-regulation mechanism would become\nineffective. Variable NaD absorption has been detected in the spectra\nof a few SNe Ia (Patat et al. 2007; Simon et al. 2009) and has been\ninterpreted as circumstellar material from the companion in an SD\nmodel. But why is such absorption seen in only a minority of cases searched?\nThe companion, in an SD scenario, will survive the explosion, and is\nlikely to be identifiable by virtue of its anomalous velocity,\nrotation, spectrum, or composition. However, searches for the survivor \nof Tycho's SN have not been able to reach a consensus\n(Ruiz Lapuente et al. 2004; Fuhrman 2005;\nIhara et al. 2007; Gonzalez-Hernandez et al. 2009; Kerzendorf et\nal. 2009). Perhaps the effects of the explosion on the companion are\nmore benign than once thought (see Pakmor et al. 2008). Hayden et\nal. (2010), however, place observational limits on the presence\n of any shock signatures in the light curves of 108 SNe Ia with good\n early-time coverage, shocks that are expected from the ejecta hitting the\n companion, as calculated by Kasen (2010).\n Finally, di Stefano (2010), and Gilfanov \\&\nBogdan (2010), have raised related arguments that the accreting and\ngrowing WDs in the SD scenario would be undergoing stable nuclear\nburning on their surfaces, and hence would be visible as super-soft\nX-ray sources (SSS). The actual numbers of SSS are far below those \nrequired to explain the observed SN Ia rate.\n\nThe DD model is also not free of problems. Foremost, it has long\nbeen argued  that the merger of two unequal-mass WDs will lead to \nan accretion-induced collapse and the formation of a neutron star,\ni.e. a core-collapse SN, rather than a SN Ia (Nomoto \\& Iben 1985;\nGuerrero et al. 2004). Others, however, have argued for ways to avoid\nthis outcome (Piersanti et al. 2003; Pakmor et al. 2010; \nVan Kerkwijk et al. 2010).\nObservationally, it has been much harder to find evidence either for\nor against the DD scenario because, by construction, it leaves\nessentially no traces -- it is the perfect crime! The most promising \navenue has been to search the Solar neighborhood for the close and\nmassive WD binaries that will merge within a Hubble time, surpassing\nthe Chandrasekhar mass and presumably \nproducing DD SNe Ia. The largest survey to\ndate, SPY (Napiwotzki et al. 2004; Geier et al. 2007) has found no\nsuch pairs among $\\sim 1000$ WDs. However, only of order one pair is probably \nexpected given the (highly uncertain) Galactic SN Ia\nrate (Maoz 2008). Clearer results may emerge from the ongoing SWARMS survey by \nBadenes et al. (2009), which searches for close binaries among an\norder of magnitude more WDs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.\n\nThere are additional problems that are shared by both scenarios, SD\nand DD. The energetics and spectra of the explosions do not come out\nright, unless finely (and artificially) tuned in an initial subsonic\ndeflagration that, at the right point in time, spontaneously evolves into\na supersonic detonation (Khokhlov 1991). \nIf the ignited mass is always near-Chandrasekhar, why is there the \nrange of SN Ia luminosities inherent to the Phillips (1993) relation?\n(Indeed, Sim et al. 2010 show that their sub-Chandrasekhar models do a fair\njob of reproducing the Phillips relation).\nWhy is there a dependence of the SN Ia luminosity (or, equivalently, \nthe mass of radioactive Ni synthesized) on the age of the galaxy host\n(e.g. Howell et al. 2009)?\nThe oldest hosts, with little star formation, are clearly observed to\nhost only faint, low-stretch, SNe Ia, while star-forming galaxies host\nboth bright-and-slow and faint-and-fast SNe Ia. Finally, both scenarios\npredict, based on binary population synthesis, SN rates that are lower\nthan actually observed (more on this later)."

        "question": "What is the typical timescale of optical microvariability observed in quasars?",
        "introduction": "The flux emitted from quasars and other Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) such as Seyferts, BL Lacs and Blazars\nhas been found to vary aperiodically on\ntime-scales from hours to decades and from X-ray to radio wavelengths. \nIn the case of radio-loud and radio-quiet quasars optical flux changes over timescales as short as minutes and\nwith amplitudes ranging from a few hundredths to a few tenths of a magnitude \n(often\nrefereed to as `optical microvariability'),\nhave been widely reported (Miller, Carini $\\&$ Goodrich \\cite{mil89}, Stalin et al. \\cite{stalin05}). The mechanism(s)\nresponsible for this short-term microvariability is still debated, with much of the visible spectral \nvariability being explained by thermal processes associated with a black-hole accretion disk and/or non-thermal processes\nassociated with the relativistic beaming of a jet (Ramirez et al. \\cite{ram10}, Pereyra et al. \\cite{per06}).\nIn fact Sesar et al. (\\cite{ses07})\nhave found that nearly all quasars vary at some level when observed over long enough times scales, with $\\sim$ 90$\\%$\nof quasars found in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) varying by $>$ 0.03 mag over a six year time scale at\nvisible wavelengths. \nAlthough the actual cause of (long-term) variability in these objects is also still a matter of\nintense debate, variability studies of these sources are important since (in principal) they can set limits on the size of the emitting\nregions and can also constrain models of the emission mechanisms  thought to operate in these\nactive galaxies.\n\nNumerous variability studies have been aimed at establishing correlations between\nquasar visible variability and important physical parameters such as source luminosity, redshift, time-lag (i.e. the time period between\ntwo sets of observations)\nand radio loudness (Helfand et al. \\cite{helf01}, Vanden Berk et al. \\cite{van04}, de Vries et al. \\cite{devries05}, Ramirez et al. \\cite{ram09}).\nThe establishment of such correlations is important since there is increasing evidence that the source\nof quasar variability\nis linked to the accretion disk surrounding the central supermassive black\nhole engine (Peterson et al. \\cite{peter04}, Pereyra et al. \\cite{per06}, Wold et al. \\cite{wold07}). For example,\nBachev (\\cite{bach09}) has studied the observed\ntime lags between the continuum emission from several optical bands for a large sample of quasars.\nHe demonstrates that the lags are broadly consistent with an emission model in\nwhich the optical variations are largely due to the reprocessing of the\ncentral X-ray radiation in a surrounding thin accretion disk. However,  both\nKelly et al.  (\\cite{kelly09}) and MacLeod et al. (\\cite{mac10}), using a `damped random walk model', have suggested\nthat these optical emission variations result from thermal\nfluctuations in the accretion disk that are powered by an underlying stochastic process such as a turbulent magnetic field.\nClearly there is still much debate as to the interpretation of \nthese optical variability studies (Kozlowski et al. \\cite{koz10}), and other emission mechanisms such as\nbursts of supernovae events close to the nucleus and extrinsic variations due to line-of-sight microlensing events\ncannot  (as yet) be totally discounted (Ulrich et al. \\cite{ulrich97}).\u00ca\nIt is mostly agreed that the level of quasar variability increases with decreasing rest wavelength, which is related to the\nobservation that their spectra become bluer in their bright phases. \nSeveral authors have claimed\na variability-redshift correlation in the visible, although the actual sign of the correlation in the\nstudies is debated (Giveon et al. \\cite{giv99}, Trevese and Vagnetti  \\cite{trev02}). For example,\nVanden Berk et al. (\\cite{van04}) have claimed evidence for redshift evolution in quasar variability,\nwith greater variability occurring at higher redshifts. However, such a trend is only revealed\nwhen an allowance is made for rest wavelength, absolute magnitude and time lag for each redshift interval.\nSuch corrections to the observed optical variability data are crucial, since spectral features may move in and\nout of the photometric pass-bands with changes in the target redshift.\n\nQuasars and AGN have also been well studied at ultraviolet (UV) wavelengths, such that typically their far UV spectra\nappear as several strong emission lines (formed in gas located further away from\na central black hole and excited by continuum radiation) superposed on an underlying accretion-driven continuum.\nIn contrast, their near UV spectra contain only a UV continuum with a `bump' at 2800\\AA\\ superposed with the MgII\nemission lines (Vanden Berk et al. \\cite{vanden01}).\nThe UV variability of these objects has been widely reported,\nparticularly with reference to\nreverberation mapping observations that in principal allow measurement\nof the size of the broad emission-line region and can infer the mass of the alleged central black hole (Peterson\net al. \\cite{peter93}, Kaspi et al. \\cite{kaspi00, kaspi07}). UV photons are generally\nbelieved to be radiated from the quasar supermassive black hole accretion disk when its gravitational\nbinding energy becomes released, while X-rays are produced in the disk corona.\nA statistical survey of the UV variability of 93\nquasar/AGN, as observed with\nthe I.U.E. satellite, was carried out by Paltani and Courvoisier (\\cite{palt94}) who found no strong evidence\nfor correlations between variability and parameters such as redshift, luminosity or UV spectra-index. However,\nchanges and instabilities in the accretion disk must surely\nbe linked to their observed UV variability, but recognizing and understanding the\nemission signatures from such features still remains problematic. \n\nTo proceed further with studies of UV variability\nwe require access to far larger data sets than previously possible, and with the launch of the\nNASA $\\it Galaxy$ $\\it Evolution$ $\\it Explorer$ (GALEX) satellite (Martin et al. \\cite{mar05}) we now have a\nsignificantly large database\nof far UV (FUV: 1350 - 1785\\AA) and near UV (NUV: 1770 - 2830\\AA) observations of quasars and AGNs that cover\na timespan of over 5 years.\nTrammell et al. (\\cite{tram07}) have \npresented a preliminary\nanalysis of the basic UV properties of  6371 SDSS Data Release 3 (DR3) selected quasars\nobserved during the first few years of the $\\it GALEX$ mission. One major conclusion from this study\nwas that $>$ 80$\\%$ of the DR3 listed quasars had a corresponding $\\it GALEX$ NUV detection,\nimplying that many more quasars should be detected during the remaining years of operation\nof the $\\it GALEX$ satellite. Bianchi et al. (\\cite{bianch09}) have shown that $\\it GALEX$ is also\nideal for detecting quasars with blue (FUV-NUV) colors that are difficult to identify from visible observations alone.\nSince the publication of these initial studies, newer and far\nlarger versions of both the\nSDSS and $\\it  GALEX$ catalogs are now in-hand.  In particular,  the \ncatalog of quasars contained in the SDSS Data Release 5 (DR5) published\nby Schneider et al.( \\cite{schn07}) lists some 77,000+ objects (with\nassociated redshift and luminosity values), the majority of which\nshould have UV counterparts observable with $\\it GALEX$. Furthermore, since\nmany quasars are known to be variable, this potentially enables us to study the UV\nvariability of a significantly large number of these sources.\n\nThe largest group of known variable sources listed in the $\\it GALEX$ UV Variability-2 catalog are active\ngalaxies (Wheatley et al. \\cite{wheat08}). This sample of sources was derived solely through selection due to their\nobserved UV variability, without prior knowledge that such sources were in fact AGN.   \nThese variable sources possessed redshifts as high as $\\it z$ $\\sim$ 2.5 and flux\nchanges as large as $\\sim$ 2.3 AB mag. were found in both of the $\\it GALEX$ near and far UV bands for\nAGN that were repeatedly observed over a 3.5 year time period. Based on the apparent\nquality of these data, we decided to\nsearch the entire $\\it GALEX$ archival database (which now spans 5+ years\nof $\\it GALEX$ observations) for spatial matches to quasars previously identified and listed in the SDSS DR5 catalog\nand then, for those sources that had multiple visit measurements, determine which ones exhibited measurable\nUV variability. This Paper discusses which $\\it GALEX$ sources were identified with SDSS quasar counterparts,\nwhich ones showed long-term  UV variability (as measured over timeframes $>$ 3 months) and which, if any, correlations\nexist between this UV variability\nand other astrophysically interesting source parameters."

        "question": "What is the typical difference in environmental density between the regions surrounding microquasar jets and those surrounding AGN jets?",
        "introduction": "From the time of discovery of relativistic jets in Galactic X-ray binary\nsources their morphological and physical similarity with AGN jets has been\nstressed in the literature \\citep[see][ for a review on the\nsubject]{mirabel:99}.  This similarity has inspired comparison of Galactic\nand extragalactic jets on a qualitative level.\n\nSuch comparisons are a powerful tool to study the dependence of jets on the\ninput conditions, knowledge of which is crucial for understanding the\nprocess of jet formation.  While the central black holes in AGNs span a\nrange of 3 orders of magnitude in central mass $M$, with measurements of\n$M$ often hampered by the lack of accurate indicators, Galactic compact\nobjects fall into a relatively narrow range in $M$, while extending the\nmass scale to a range of over 9 orders of magnitude.\n\nSo far, the comparison has focused mainly on the emission from the inner\njet, while large scale (lobe) emission has traditionally been difficult to\nobserve in Galactic jets and has thus not been considered much in the\nliterature.  This {\\em letter} presents arguments for the scaling expected\non large scales.  Section 2, reviews the scaling relations of jet\nparameters.  In Sect. 3 we argue that, typically, microquasar jets are\nlocated in low density environments compared to AGN jets, derive simple\nscaling relations for radio lobes and put limits on the ISM density\nsurrounding GRS 1915+105 and GRO J1655$-$40.

        "question": "What is the approximate size range of solar bright points in the photosphere?",
        "introduction": "In order to understand which processes control solar activity, we must know how the Sun's magnetic\nfield interacts with the solar plasma and how it influences the conversion of energy between its mechanical, magnetic, thermal, and radiative forms.\nIn the photosphere the thermal, kinetic, and magnetic energy have the same order of magnitude, so that this layer of the solar atmosphere plays\na key role because there the energy can easily be transformed from one form into another. This interaction is responsible for the creation of\na variety of magnetic structures, starting with sunspots ($\\sim$10000-50000~km), pores ($\\sim$1000-5000~km), and micropores ($\\sim$300-1000~km) down to\nbright points ($\\sim$200~km or less), among the smallest known magnetic features.\n\nBright points (BPs) are brightness enhancements in the dark lanes separating solar granules. BPs are caused by magnetic flux concentrations\nin the kilogauss range and are important for, e.g., the analysis of the solar influence on the Earth's climate. In the last 35 years, measurements\nof satellite-based instruments revealed that the solar constant (which is the solar irradiance integrated over all wavelengths) is not constant, but\nvaries over an 11 year cycle by about 0.1\\,\\%. Surprisingly, the solar constant is on average higher during maximum solar activity than during minimum\n(Willson \\& Hudson 1988). The darkness of the sunspots is overcompensated by the increased brightness of BPs, whose number density is considerably higher\naround sunspots than in the quiet Sun (Fr\\\"ohlich 2013; Solanki et al. 2013).\n\nThe magnitude of the variation of the solar irradiance is not uniformly distributed over the electromagnetic spectrum, but 60\\,\\% of the variations (Krivova et al. 2006) or\neven more (Harder et al. 2009) are produced at wavelengths shorter than 400\\,nm. A variation of the ultraviolet (UV) radiation changes the chemistry of the\nstratosphere which can propagate into the troposphere and hence influence the weather and climate on Earth (London 1994; Haigh et al. 2010; Ermolli et al. 2012).\nThe most famous indication of a solar influence on the terrestrial climate is the so-called Maunder minimum, the period between 1645-1715 in which almost no\nsunspots were observed and which coincides with the coldest part of the little ice age in Europe and Northern America.\n\nOne possibility to gain time series of the photosphere in the UV spectral range with high spatial and temporal resolution is to fly a telescope in the gondola\nof a stratospheric balloon. Such balloon flights have a long tradition in solar physics, which was extended by the \\sunrise{} mission described below\n(an overview of the mission is given by Solanki et al. 2010 and Barthol et al. 2011)."

        "question": "How many confirmed transiting exoplanets with orbital periods greater than 500 days were reported in the NASA Exoplanet Archive at the time of this study?",
        "introduction": "Since the end of the primary \\Kepler Mission, the number of confirmed or validated transiting exoplanets with periods of hundreds of days has grown rapidly, despite their low inherent transit probabilities. Presently, the NASA Exoplanet Archive reports 138 confirmed transiting exoplanets with periods greater than 100 days, 9 of which have periods greater than 500 days \\citep{Akeson2013}. This is in part due to dedicated searches for long-period exoplanets \\citep[e.g.][]{Fischer2012,Wang2015,Uehara2016} and is also a result of the ongoing analysis of the \\Kepler data set \\citep[e.g.][]{Morton2016,Kipping2016b}. \n\nLong-period exoplanets that orbit near or beyond their systems' snow-lines provide valuable opportunities to explore theories of planetary formation and evolution \\citep{Oberg2011}. Their atmospheric abundances provide a test of theories such as core accretion \\citep{Pollack1996} and disk instabilities \\citep{Boss1997}. Furthermore, massive long-period planets may influence the dynamic stability and final architecture of multi-planet systems through planetary migration \\citep{Rasio1996,Ida2004}. \n\nA variety of observational challenges have so far impeded efforts to probe the atmospheres of exoplanets akin to the four gas giants in the solar system. Their low effective temperatures prevent detection through direct imaging. These exoplanets' slow orbital velocities also limit the usefulness of high-resolution spectroscopy to observe Doppler-shifted, atmospheric spectral features \\citep{Snellen2010,Birkby2013}. Characterizing long-period exoplanet atmospheres through reflected light is possible but will not be feasible until the launch of future missions such as the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope \\citep{Spergel2015,Lupu2016}. \n\nThe atmospheres of long-period transiting exoplanets can be probed via transmission spectroscopy \\citep{Dalba2015}. However, for an exoplanet with fewer than three documented transits, the magnitude of transit timing variations (TTVs) due to the dynamical influence of an unknown companion is unconstrained. In some cases, long-period exoplanets exhibit TTVs of up to 40 hours \\citep{Wang2015}. Without an estimate of the magnitude of TTVs, planning follow-up observations for atmospheric characterization is a risky practice, if not altogether infeasible. \n\nHere we focus on the long-period exoplanet \\textit{Kepler}-421b: a 4.2-$R_{\\earth}$ planet transiting a G9V star with an orbital period of $\\sim$704 days discovered by \\citet{Kipping2014a}. \\textit{Kepler}-421b has a calculated equilibrium temperature of $\\sim$185 K (assuming a Bond albedo of 0.3) and likely resides near its system's snow-line. The \\textit{Kepler} Spacecraft only observed two 15.8-hour transits of \\textit{Kepler}-421b in Quarters 5 and 13. Since the re-purposed \\textit{K2} Mission cannot return to the original \\Kepler field \\citep{Howell2014}, there was no dedicated observatory to view the third transit that was set to occur on UT 2016 February 19. With only two documented transits and no information about companions in the \\textit{Kepler}-421 system, the influence of TTVs on \\textit{Kepler}-421b's transit ephemeris was entirely unknown.   \n\nIn this letter, we describe ground-based observations of \\textit{Kepler}-421 taken during the anticipated third transit of \\textit{Kepler}-421b (assuming a linear ephemeris) in order to constrain the magnitude of TTVs."

        "question": "What is the typical X-ray luminosity range of Ultraluminous X-ray objects (ULXs) observed in nearby galaxies?",
        "introduction": "\\label{s:intro}\n\nIn the early 1980s, surveys of normal galaxies with the Einstein X-ray\nsatellite revealed intermediate-luminosity (L$_X$ $\\sim$\n10$^{39}$$-$10$^{40}$ erg~s$^{-1}$) X-ray sources which were seemingly\nlocated in the centers of spiral galaxies (Fabbiano 1989).  This was\nvery interesting, since Seyfert nuclei (active galactic nuclei [AGNs]\nin nearby spirals) are typically much more luminous (L$_X$ $\\sim$\n10$^{42}$$-$10$^{44}$ erg~s$^{-1}$) and black hole X-ray binaries (BH\nXRBs) are much less luminous (typically L$_X$ $\\lesssim$ 10$^{38}$\nerg~s$^{-1}$).  It was not clear whether these intriguing sources were\nunderluminous accreting supermassive BHs, overluminous XRBs located\nnear the galactic nucleus, or an entirely new type of astrophysical\nobject altogether (e.g., Colbert \\etal 1995).  In the 1990s, ROSAT\nHigh Resolution Imager (HRI) observations showed that these\nUltraluminous X-ray objects (ULXs; also known as\nIntermediate-luminosity X-ray Objects, or IXOs) are compact X-ray\nsources, and are quite common in the local Universe (Colbert \\&\nMushotzky 1999; Roberts \\& Warwick 2000).  Many ULXs were found to be\noffset from the optical nucleus (e.g., Colbert \\& Mushotzky 1999).\nMore complete surveys from ROSAT (e.g., Roberts \\& Warwick 2000;\nColbert \\& Ptak 2002) and Chandra imaging data place their frequency\nof occurrence at about one in every five galaxies (Ptak \\& Colbert 2004). \nMost of the ULXs found\nin these surveys are clearly significantly displaced from the galactic\nnuclei, implying that their masses must be $\\lesssim$10$^5$\nM$_{\\odot}$ since dynamical friction would otherwise cause them to\nsink to the center of the galaxy in a Hubble time (Tremaine, Ostriker\n\\& Spitzer 1975).\n\nULXs are generally unresolved at the high spatial resolution ($\\sim\n0.5''$) of Chandra, and many show variability (Colbert \\& Ptak 2002;\nFabbiano \\etal 2003), which rules out the hypothesis that ULXs are\nclosely-spaced aggregates of lower-luminosity X-ray sources. Bondi\naccretion from a dense ISM may not be sufficient to explain the observed\nluminosities (King \\etal 2001), although an intermediate mass black\nhole ($M \\gtrsim 300 M_{\\odot}$) in a dense molecular cloud may\nachieve luminosities in excess of $10^{39} \\rm \\ ergs \\ s^{-1}$\n(Krolik 2004) . They are therefore most likely powered\nby accretion in binary systems. This is supported by evidence for\nperiodicity in a few individual objects (Sugiho \\etal 2001; Liu\n\\etal 2002b). If one assumes that ULXs have L$_X$ below the Eddington\nluminosity and are not beamed, then the mass of the central object is\nrequired to be in the range $\\sim 15-500 M_\\odot$. This is too massive\nto be a neutron star or a black hole formed through normal stellar\nevolution, thus we would have to be dealing with intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs). This interpretation is quite fascinating, as\nreviewed by van der Marel (2004) and Miller \\& Colbert (2004). For\nsome individual ULXs it has been argued that the presence of an IMBH\nis plausible (Portegies Zwart \\etal 2004), but in general it poses\nmany challenges from a theoretical point of view (see King\n\\etal 2001; King 2002). Alternatively, ULXs may instead be\nstellar-mass black hole systems that are emitting anisotropically with\neither mild (King \\etal 2001) or relativistic beaming (K\\\"ording,\nFalcke \\& Markoff 2002), or are actually emitting at super-Eddington\nrates (Begelman 2002; Grimm, Gilfanov \\& Sunyaev 2002). For example,\nthe galactic microquasar GRS 1915 has a known black hole mass of $14\nM_{\\odot}$ and is often observed with X-ray luminosities exceeding\n$10^{39}\\rm \\ ergs \\ s^{-1}$, qualifying it as an ULX. In this case\nthe high luminosity is due to both relativistic beaming and\nsuper-Eddington emission (King 2002; Mirabel \\& Rodriguez 1999).\n\nPhenomenologically there appear to be several breeds of ULXs.  They\nmay be preferentially found in star-forming galaxies (Kilgard \\etal\n2002; Grimm \\etal 2003), with starburst galaxies such as the Antennae\n(Zezas \\etal 2002; Zezas \\& Fabbiano 2002) and the Cartwheel (Gao\n\\etal 2003) having large numbers of ULXs. This suggests an\nassociation between the incidence of ULXs and star formation (although\nPtak \\& Colbert [2004] have found that this is not necessarily the\ncase in general). Indeed, optical counterparts reported for ULXs\nsuggest a young star cluster in one case (Goad \\etal 2002) and a\nsingle O-star in another case (Liu, Bregman \\& Seitzer\n2002a). \\citet{tera06} discuss a study of optical counterparts to ULXs\nin M51 and varyingly find no, one or several candidate counterparts.\nThe colors and absolute magnitudes of counterparts in several cases\n(where there were only one or two counterparts) were consistent with\nstars of mass 7-9 $M_{\\odot}$ and 10-15 $M_{\\odot}$, implying\nthat these ULXs may be high-mass X-ray binaries.\n A\nradio counterpart was found for a ULX in the dwarf galaxy NGC 5408\n(Kaaret \\etal 2003), with two possible HST counterparts in the X-ray\nerror circle.  The brighter of these counterparts has $M_V\n\\sim -6.2$, consistent with a supergiant O star.  \n\nULXs have also been\nfound in elliptical galaxies and galactic bulges (Colbert \\& Ptak\n2002; Angelini \\etal 2001; Wu \\etal 2002; Jeltema \\etal 2003). This\nsuggests that some ULXs are associated with old systems such as\nglobular clusters.  However, ULXs with $L_X > 2 \\times 10^{39} \\rm \\\nergs \\ s^{-1}$ found in ellipticals are often not associated with\nglobular clusters and are observed in numbers consistent with the\nexpected number of background sources (Irwin \\etal 2004).  A study of\noptical counterparts to four ULXs by Gutierrez (2006) found that three\nare background AGN and one is likely to be foreground star.  Three of\nthese ULXs were found in early-type galaxies, again showing a tendency\nfor ULXs associated with early-type galaxies to be background AGN.\n\nX-ray spectroscopy can give clues about accretion disks and coronae\nthat may be present in ULXs (Colbert \\& Mushotzky 1999; Makishima \n\\etal 2000; Roberts \\etal 2001; Strickland \\etal 2001; Zezas \\etal 2002; \nFoschini \\etal 2002; Miller \\etal 2003). However, there are important\nquestions about the nature of ULXs that can only be answered using the\nmulti-wavelength properties of as large a sample of ULXs as\npossible. In the Antennae, ULXs are often observed close to star\nclusters, but not coincident with them. This may suggest a scenario in\nwhich ULXs are X-ray binaries that can be ejected out of clusters\nthrough recoil (Portegies Zwart \\& McMillan 2000). If this is\ngenerally true then it would preclude an IMBH because the mass would\nbe too large for the binary to be ejected (Miller \\& Hamilton 2002).\nIn cases where individual counterparts are not detected learning about\nthe environment of the ULXs can also be instructive. For example, it\nhas been suggested that ULXs in late-type galaxies are preferentially\nfound in or near HII regions (Pakull \\& Mirioni 2002).\n\nWe have established a pipeline to continuously\nanalyze Chandra data from galaxies as it becomes publicly available,\nwith emphasis on producing a catalog of ULXs. The\npresent paper presents a study of archival Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST) images obtained with the Second Wide Field and Planetary Camera\n(WFPC2) of fields that contain ULXs in our Chandra catalog. The goal\nis to search for optical counterparts to the ULXs, and to characterize\ntheir environment. While a few individual optical ULX counterparts\nhave been reported by other groups, the present work represents the\nfirst large-scale Chandra/HST ULX cross-comparison and cataloging\neffort. The use of HST data is critical, given that ground-based\nobservations do not have the spatial resolution to resolve individual\nstars (unless the star is unusually isolated) and often cannot reach\nthe apparent magnitudes of even supergiant stars except for the\nnearest galaxies. The results provide much improved statistics with\nfewer biases than previous work, as well as a catalog of sources for\nuse in follow-up studies.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows. Section~\\ref{s:sample} discusses\nthe sample selection and the Chandra and HST data that we have used\nfor the study. Section~\\ref{s:astrocor} discusses the astrometric\nregistration of the Chandra and HST data. Section~\\ref{s:photometry}\ndiscusses the results from photometric analysis on the potential\ncounterparts that were located. Section~\\ref{s:discuss} discusses the\nmain results of the study, and the implications for our understanding\nof ULXs. Section~\\ref{s:conc} summarizes the main conclusions."

        "question": "What is the Waldmeier effect in solar cycle dynamics?",
        "introduction": "\\label{s:introduction} \n\nThe main features of solar magnetic activity, as measured by the solar (or Wolf) sunspots number (SSN), are successfully explained by dynamo theory \\cite{Ossendrijver2003}.  A short cycle was first discovered by Schwabe and later reported by Wolf, who estimated its period to be approximately 11 years.  This cycle is not periodic, with variations in amplitude and length, and also phases of inactivity such as the Maunder minimum.  Longer-scale structures known as Gleissberg cycles have also been identified, but their analysis is complicated by the limited time-span of observations.  The existence of multiple-scale dynamics, or non-stationarity, adds a layer of complexity to the important problem of solar-activity forecasting.  This problem is technologically relevant as it affects the estimation of orbital drag and other space-weather effects such as the rate of solar flares, coronal mass ejections, and cosmic rays.\n\nDifferent methods have been proposed in the literature to predict the maximum amplitude of Solar Cycle 24 (for a good review see \\citeauthor{Pesnell2008}, 2008).  Following \\inlinecite{Pesnell2008}, existing techniques can be broadly classified as climatological, precursor, dynamo model, spectral, and neural network:\n\\begin{itemize}\n\\item Climatological forecasts assume that amplitude variations around the mean are random and therefore predict a forthcoming cycle of mean intensity, where the average can be computed over the full historical record or a more recent past \\cite{Wang2002,Horstman2005,Kim2006,Lantos2006,Clilverd2006}.  \n\\item Precursor methods have recourse to leading indicators of solar activity.  Two important examples of this type of signals are the intensity of solar polar magnetic fields and geomagnetic activity at the declining phase or cycle minimum \\cite{Schatten2005,Svalgaard2005,Hathaway2006,Jain2006,Hamid2006,Kane2007-2}.  \n\\item Dynamo models, on the other hand, attempt to explain solar dynamics from first principles by integrating conservation equations.  Examples of this type of approach include \\inlinecite{Dikpati2006} and \\inlinecite{Choudhuri2007}. \n\\item Spectral methods search for regularities or predictable patterns in the spectral content of the SSN time series.  Autoregressive forecasts are also classified as spectral.  Representative examples are given by \\inlinecite{Kane1999}, \\inlinecite{Duhau2003}, \\inlinecite{deMeyer2003}, \\inlinecite{Clilverd2006}, and \\inlinecite{Hiremath2008}.\n\\item Finally, neural networks attempt to capture nonlinear relationships between a set of input features and future solar activity.  Examples in this category are given by \\inlinecite{Calvo1995}, \\inlinecite{Verdes2004}, and \\inlinecite{Maris2006}.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nThe proposed method is statistical in nature and falls into the climatological class.  More precisely, we apply and extend a previously developed methodology for maximum solar-activity prediction \\cite{Verdes2000}.  Based on the curvature of the SSN time series at a solar-cycle minimum, we forecast the main features of the following cycle, namely maximum amplitude, time to maximum, and total length.  In \\inlinecite{Verdes2000} we proposed a restricted version of this approach only for the prediction of maximum amplitude and applied it to the case of Solar Cycle 23.  The contributions of the present work are: i) the application of the previously proposed technique to predict the maximum intensity of Solar Cycle 24, and ii) its extension to forecast other cycle features such as ascent time and total length.  The rationale behind the proposed method can be ultimately summarised as follows: fast-rising cycles will reach higher levels than slower-rising ones, with shorter ascent times and total cycle lengths.  This is known as the Waldmeier effect \\cite{Waldmeier1955} and has been further documented by \\inlinecite{Hathaway1994}, \\inlinecite{Hathaway2002}, and \\inlinecite{Dikpati2008}.\nAs a proxy for rising speed we use the curvature (second derivative) at the minima of the SSN time series, and effectively find that it determines the main characteristics of the unfolding cycle.  We report details on these studies below."

        "question": "What is the significance of the equation of state parameter w being equal to -1 for dark energy?",
        "introduction": "The equation of state parameter of dark energy -the mysterious\nagent responsible for the current accelerated expansion of the\nUniverse- ranks among the biggest unknowns in cosmology. It is\nusually written as $w= p_{\\phi}/\\rho_{\\phi}$ and lies in the range\n$(-1, -1/3)$ if the dark energy is quintessence, and $(- \\infty,\n-1)$ if it is of phantom type; in either case it may run with\nexpansion. By contrast, in the very particular (but\nobservationally favored) instance of a cosmological constant $\\,\nw$ stays fixed at $\\, -1$. It is then apparent that some knowledge\non the nature of dark energy can be gained by setting limits on\n$w$.\n\nObservational constraints on this quantity from supernovae type Ia\n(SN Ia), temperature anisotropies of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation (CMB), baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO),\netc, suggest that nowadays $w$ is not far from the cosmological\nconstant value. However, all these studies rest on some or other\nworld model and on inevitable priors imposed upon the parameters\nspace to ease the data analysis.\n\nRecently, bounds on $w$ have been derived  from the very\nreasonable requirement that the variation experienced by the dark\nenergy scalar field $\\phi$ (regardless it may be phantom or\nquintessence) from any redshift, $z$, within the classical\nexpansion era, till now should not exceed Planck's mass (see Huang\n\\cite{huang}, and Saridakis \\cite{saridakis}). This is to say\n\\begin{equation}\n|\\Delta \\phi(z)|/M_{P} < 1 \\, ,\n\\label{condition}\n\\end{equation}\n\\noindent where -as can be readily deduced-\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{|\\Delta \\phi (z)|}{M_{P}} = \\frac{1}{M_{P}} \\,\n\\int_{t}^{t_{0}} {\\dot{\\phi} \\, dt} = \\int_{0}^{z}{\\frac{\\sqrt{3\n\\, |1+w(x)| \\, \\Omega_{\\phi}(x)}}{1+x}}\\, dx \\, . \\label{Deltaphi}\n\\end{equation}\n\nHuang's analysis confines itself to quintessence fields with\nvarious $w$ parameterizations (viz: $w$ constant, a linear\nfunction of redshift, and the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder\nparametrization \\cite{ch-p,linder}) \\cite{huang}. Saridakis\nconsiders phantom fields only and uses identical parameterizations\nthan Huang plus a further one in which $w$ depends linearly  on\nthe logarithm of the scale factor \\cite{saridakis}.\n\n\nThe bound (\\ref{condition}) looks a rather natural condition and\npersuasive arguments  have been advanced in its favor\n\\cite{banks,huang1,yun-gui}. Moreover, we have found a further,\nsolid, motivation for it. Namely: if condition (\\ref{condition})\nis violated, then dark energy dominates at very early times which\ncannot be reconciled with observation (see Fig. \\ref{fig4} and\n``forbidden\" regions on the top right corner of the panels of\nfigures \\ref{fig6}, \\ref{fig9}, and \\ref{fig11}, below). In\nparticular, as noted by Bean {\\it et al.} \\cite{rachelbean}, the\nfractional density of dark energy cannot exceed $5 \\%$ and $39 \\%$\nat the primeval nucleosynthesis and recombination epochs,\nrespectively, -we shall elaborate on this in a future publication.\nNevertheless, we refrain ourselves from imposing (\\ref{condition})\non every dark energy field. Its seems safer to demand that\n$|\\Delta \\phi|/M_{P}$  be not much larger than order unity.\nHowever, the latter requirement cannot be easily implemented and,\nat any rate, it would translate on rather loose constraints on\n$w$. Therefore, we choose to circumscribe our analysis to dark\nenergy fields that fulfill condition (\\ref{condition}).\n\nIn Huang's as well as in Saridakis' work matter and dark energy\ninteract with each other only gravitationally. Certainly this is a\nreasonable assumption but nonetheless minimalist since, while dark\nenergy interactions with baryons are severely restricted by solar\nsystem experiments \\cite{solar}, there is nothing against a\npossible coupling (interaction) with dark matter. On the contrary,\na transfer from dark energy to dark matter alleviates the cosmic\ncoincidence problem (the observational fact that both energy\ndensities are comparable today \\cite{paul}) and may  solve it in\nfull \\cite{rapidc}. Besides, as revealed by optical, x-ray and\nweak-lensing data, the internal dynamics of 33 relaxed galaxy\nclusters seems to favor such interaction \\cite{binw}. Likewise, a\nrecent analysis using the 397 SN Ia of the ``Constitution\" set\n\\cite{constitution}, BAO and CMB data adds significant weight to\nthe existence of the coupling \\cite{shafieloo}. In fact, the\nsubject has evolved into a field of active research -see e.g.\n\\cite{active,gabriela1} and references therein; a recent review\ncan be found in \\cite{review}.\n\nIn the presence of a coupling, say $Q$, the continuity equations\nfor the three main contributors to the present cosmic budget adopt\nthe form,\n\\begin{eqnarray}\n\\dot{\\rho}_{b}\\, &+&\\, 3H \\rho_{b} = 0 \\, , \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\rho}_{c}\\, &+& \\, 3 H \\rho_{c} = Q \\, , \\nonumber \\\\\n\\dot{\\rho}_{\\phi}\\, &+& \\, 3 H (1+w) \\rho_{\\phi} = - Q \\, ,\n\\label{continuity}\n\\end{eqnarray}\nwhere the subscripts, $b$, $c$, and $\\phi$ stands for baryons,\ncold dark matter, and dark energy, respectively. This paper aims\nto constrain  different parameterizations of $w$ under diverse\nexpressions for $Q$. Regrettably, guidelines about the latter are\nrather loose: it must be positive-semidefinite and small. If $Q$\nwere negative, the energy densities could become negative, and the\nsecond law of thermodynamics get violated \\cite{db}. If it were\nlarge, dark energy would have dominated the expansion at early\ntimes and possibly not today. Thus, for the time being, we must\ncontent ourselves with guessing plausible expressions for $Q$ just\non phenomenological bases.\n\nIn view of the above equations the coupling must be a function of\n$H \\rho_{c}$ and $H \\rho_{\\phi}$.

To simplify the analysis we will consider\nin turn that one of the two coefficients vanishes.

However, as we shall see,\nthis is not the case. {\\em A priori} we can argue in favor of some\nnon small departure from the findings of \\cite{huang} and\n\\cite{saridakis} by considering the ratio between $Q$ and the\nsecond term in last equation of (\\ref{continuity}). Indeed,\ndividing the right hand side of (\\ref{int}.1) by the second term\nof the said equation yields $\\epsilon/(1+w)$. In general, this\nratio cannot be neglected and it can be large in absolute value\nwhen $w$ is close to $-1$. Likewise, using  instead (\\ref{int}.2)\nwe have $\\epsilon \\, \\rho_{c}/(1+w)\\rho_{\\phi}$. Its absolute\nvalue can be of order unity, or even larger, for extended periods\nof the cosmic history.\n\nAlthough  expressions (\\ref{int}) were proposed on\nphenomenological grounds they can be obtained in scalar-tensor\ngravity from the action (in the Einstein frame) \\cite{kaloper}\n\\begin{equation}\nS = \\int{d^{4}x\\, \\sqrt{-g}}\\, \\left\\{ \\frac{1}{16 \\pi G} R -\n\\frac{1}{2} \\,\\partial_{a}\\phi \\,\\partial^{a} \\phi \\, + \\,\n\\frac{1}{\\chi^{2}(\\phi)}\\, L_{c}(\\zeta, \\partial \\zeta, \\chi^{-1}\ng_{ab})\\, + \\, L_{b}(\\xi, \\partial \\xi, \\chi^{-1} g_{ab}) \\right\\}\n\\, . \\label{action}\n\\end{equation}\nHere $R$ denotes the Ricci scalar, $L_{c}$ and $\\zeta$ stand for\nthe dark matter Lagrangian and the dark matter degrees of freedom,\nrespectively (corresponding meanings have $L_{b}$ and $\\xi$); on\nthe other hand, $\\chi(\\phi)$ couples dark matter with the dark\nenergy field $\\phi$. From (\\ref{action}) the interaction term\nbetween dark matter and dark energy can be expressed as\n\\begin{equation}\nQ = H \\rho_{c} \\left[\\frac{d(\\ln \\bar{\\chi}(a))}{d \\ln a}\\right]\n\\, ,\n\\label{Q-action}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $\\bar{\\chi}(a) = \\chi(a)^{(3w_{c} - 1)/2}$ with $w_{c}$ the\nequation of state parameter of dark matter (zero in our case).

        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\n\n\n\n\\src\\ is a novel transient radio source \\citep{hlkrmy-z05,hlrrkn06}, whose\nnotable properties have included ``bursts'' with approximately 1~Jy peak flux density\nlasting approximately 10~min.\\ each and occurring at apparently\nregular 77~min.\\\nintervals. We first identified \\src\\\nfrom archival~330~MHz (90~cm) observations taken with the Very Large Array (VLA)\non~2002 September~30. We then detected a single burst from the source with the Giant\nMetrewave Radio \nTelescope (GMRT) in archival observations from~2003 September~28 at the same frequency.\n\\src\\ is located about~1.25\\arcdeg\\ south of the\nGalactic center just outside (in angular distance) the shell-type\nsupernova remnant \\objectname[]{SNR~G359.1$-$0.5} \\citep{rf84}. The\nenvironment of the source is discussed further in \\cite{hlrrkn06}.\n\nThe source \\src\\ is notable because it is one of a small number of \n\\emph{radio-selected} transients.  Moreover, with only a few\nexceptions \\citep{m02} such as electron cyclotron masers from flare\nstars and the planets, plasma emission from solar radio flares, pulsar\nradio emission, and molecular-line masers, most radio transients are\nincoherent synchrotron emitters.  For an incoherent synchrotron\nemitter, the energy density within the source is limited to an\neffective brightness temperature of roughly $10^{12}$~K by the inverse\nCompton catastrophe \\citep{readhead94}.\nThe properties of \\src\\ suggest strongly that its brightness\ntemperature exceeds $10^{12}$~K by a large factor and that it is a\nmember of a new class of coherent emitters \\citep{hlkrmy-z05}.\n\nThe two previous detections of \\src\\ were based on VLA and GMRT 330~MHz observations from\ntwo different epochs, but from which similar source properties were observed.  \nThis \\emph{Letter} reports on a third 330~MHz archival observation of \\src, made with the \nGMRT in 2004, in which a single, much fainter and shorter burst is detected in contrast\nto the burst properties observed in 2002 and 2003. In addition, the burst is found to have a very steep spectrum, as expected for a coherent emitter, providing another important clue to understanding the nature of this enigmatic source.\n\nPossible models for \\src\\ include nearby objects such as a flaring brown\ndwarf, flare star, or extra-solar planet, although, as discussed in\n\\cite{hlkrmy-z05}, the properties of the source do not easily fit these classes.\nAlternative models proposed for \\src\\ thus far are a nulling pulsar (\\cite{kp05}),\na double pulsar (\\cite{tpt05}), a transient white dwarf pulsar \n(\\cite{zhanggil}), and a precessing radio pulsar (\\cite{zhuxu}). As noted in\nthe latter paper, the double pulsar model predicts a $\\sim$3-yr bursting\nactivity period which is not supported by the redetections in 2003 and 2004.     \nFurthermore, in \\cite{hlrrkn06} we presented tentative evidence suggesting that the 2003 burst was\nan isolated one, and not one of several bursts emitted at 77 min.\nintervals, as observed in 2002.\nThis evidence could be problematic for some or all of \nthese models. For example, the proposed double pulsar\nwould link the radio emission to a 77 min. orbital period. In this model, \ncoherent radio emission is triggered by the shock formed through the interaction\nof the wind of the more enigmatic pulsar with the magnetosphere of the companion pulsar.\nOn the other hand, in analogy to the PSR B1259-63 system which consists of a pulsar and Be star companion, \nit is also possible that the magnetosphere of the companion is not constant, and therefore that \nthe radio bursts are not always triggered every orbit. \nIndeed, the much fainter detection from \\src\\ reported in this \\emph{Letter} could  be\nevidence of variable conditions in the environment around a companion star.\n \n\nSimilarly, the precessing radio pulsar and transient white dwarf pulsar models would also require one or more\ntypes of nulling effects to explain the occurrence of isolated bursts in the short term,\nas well as the low duty cycle in the long term. A few radio pulsars\nare known to have a very large nulling fraction. PSR B1931+24 remains in an off state for $\\sim$90\\% of the time,\nand it emits bursts quasi-periodically at $\\sim$40 per day \\citep{cordesetal04}.\nSuch a high nulling fraction may be consistent with the measured duty cycle estimated for \\src."

        "question": "What is the primary advantage of using weak gravitational lensing over galaxy surveys to map the distribution of matter in the universe?",
        "introduction": "Mapping the matter distribution of the universe is one of the principal\naims of cosmology. The traditional approach to this problem has been the\nuse of galaxy surveys, the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey\n\\shortcite{2001MNRAS.328.1039C} and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n\\shortcite{2000AJ....120.1579Y} being the most relevant examples today.\nHowever, galaxy surveys only map the luminous matter in the universe;\ngeneralising to all forms of matter requires the additional assumption\nthat the luminous matter faithfully traces the total matter\ndistribution. On the other hand, weak lensing, or the coherent\ndistortion of the shapes of background galaxies by intervening matter,\nrequires no such assumption and is emerging as a powerful tool to map\nthe matter in the universe.\n\nThe possibility of lensing by large scale structure (LSS) was first\npointed out in pioneering work by \\citeN{1967ApJ...150..737G} and has\nsince been theoretically and numerically studied by a number of authors\n(\\shortciteNP{1991MNRAS.251..600B}, \\shortciteNP{1991ApJ...380....1M},\n\\shortciteNP{1992ApJ...388..272K}, \\citeNP{1997A&A...322....1B},\n\\shortciteNP{1998ApJ...498...26K}, \\shortciteNP{1997ApJ...484..560J},\n\\shortciteNP{2000Natur.405..143W}, \\citeNP{2000ApJ...530..547J},\n\\shortciteNP{2000Natur.405..143W}). However, detecting this ``cosmic\nshear'' had to wait for advances in imaging technology and has only\nrecently become possible. \nThere now are a number of detections (\\citeNP{2000MNRAS.318..625B},\n\\shortciteNP{2000A&A...358...30V},\n\\citeNP{2001ApJ...552L..85R}, \n\\shortciteNP{2002ApJ...572...55H}) by various groups and with more\nobservations in progress or planned, this number will \ncontinue to grow. The next generation of lensing observations such as\nthe NOAO deep field, the CFHT legacy survey and the Deep Lens Survey \nwill go beyond simply detecting cosmic shear but will map it over\nlarge areas of the sky. \nSuch large scale surveys will herald in an era of precision cosmology\nfor weak lensing. At the same time, these surveys bring with them the\nsame computational challenges that current CMB experiments and galaxy\nsurveys are facing. The number of background galaxies is\n$N_{gal} \\sim$ 10$^{5}$ to 10$^{6}$, making any brute force approach\nprohibitively expensive. Analysing these surveys therefore requires the\ndevelopment of algorithms that make the problem computationally\ntractable. Furthermore, the algorithms must be able to handle aspects of\nreal data including noise, incomplete sampling, arbitrary cuts and so\non.\n\nThis work has two principal goals; the first is the development of an\nalgorithm that solves the computational challenges of large $N$\nsurveys, where $N$ can be number of galaxies or just pixelized intensity \n(as for the CMB). \nWe then test this algorithm (described in detail in the\nAppendix) on various applications of weak lensing surveys using\nsimulated data. The paper therefore serves the dual purpose of being a\ntest of our algorithm as well as a survey of the potential\nof weak lensing surveys in cosmology.\n\nWe focus on three applications of weak lensing that we believe are the\nmost interesting for cosmology. The first of these, reconstructing the\nmatter distribution, is the basic goal of large lensing surveys. Lensing\nmeasures the integrated line of sight matter distribution, or the\nconvergence ($\\kappa$) map. Since this reconstruction includes all\nmatter, luminous and dark, such a map gives us a glimpse of the true\ndistribution of matter in the universe. Such maps could also be combined\nwith the high quality imaging data of the lensing survey to understand\nthe relationship between luminous and dark matter.\nWeak lensing reconstructions have been considered under two broad\ncontexts, cluster mass reconstructions\n(\\shortciteNP{1993ApJ...404..441K}, \\shortciteNP{1995ApJ...449..460K},\n\\shortciteNP{1995A&A...297..287S}) and LSS reconstructions\n\\shortcite{1998ApJ...506...64S}. Since the surveys we are considering in\nthis paper are large field surveys, we will focus on methods for the\nlatter, including effects of non uniform sampling, irregular boundaries\nand noise.\n\nThe next scales of interest are the largest gravitationally bound\nsystems in the universe, clusters of galaxies. \nAs clusters are the rarest and most massive of all structures, they\nprovide a sensitive probe of structure \nformation and the initial conditions of the universe. One such test is\nthe number density of clusters \n\\shortcite{1998ApJ...504....1B} as a function of mass and redshift,\nwhich \ndepends sensitively both on the total matter in the universe as well as\nthe presence \nof dark energy and its properties. In order to use such tests, \none needs to have a large catalogue of clusters, with well defined\nselection criteria \nand completeness fractions. One approach is to use large photometric or\nspectroscopic surveys of galaxies \\shortcite{2001astro.ph.10307W} to\nconstruct such catalogues; lensing provides us with an alternative\napproach (\\shortciteNP{2001AAS...199.1608H},\n\\shortciteNP{2001astro.ph.11490W}). An advantage to lensing is that it\ndetects all massive structures, whether they are luminous or not, while\nother methods assume the presence of luminous matter. Since theory\npredicts the total number of such objects, lensing allows for the most\ndirect comparison to predictions. Also, any \npossible existence of ``dark clusters'' (e.g.\n\\shortciteNP{2002A&A...388...68M}) would bias the latter methods, \nwhile lensing surveys would be unaffected. However, lensing has its own\ndisadvantages \nthat must be understood, if it is to be reliably used.\n\nThis paper develops a method to detect clusters in lensing surveys, as\nwell as addressing the theoretical limitations of lensing for cluster\nsearches. It then characterises the completeness and reliability\n(defined below) of such surveys. We also examine the potential of such\nsurveys to constrain the profile of the dark matter haloes associated\nwith such clusters. This work parallels and extends the work in\n\\shortciteN{2001astro.ph.11490W}, although we use different methods.\n\nFinally, we address the measurement of the convergence power spectrum.\nThe power spectrum is one of a host of \nstatistics that can be measured, but it has emerged as the statistic of\nchoice for cosmology, \nsince many models predict a gaussian random field distribution on large\nscales, for which the power spectrum \ncontains all the information. Also, the power spectrum has a natural\ninterpretation from linear structure formation, and therefore is a\npowerful probe of cosmology, especially in conjuction with other\nastrophysical measurements (\\shortciteNP{1997ApJ...484..560J},\n\\shortciteNP{1998ApJ...498...26K}, \\shortciteNP{1999ApJ...514L..65H}).\nThe techniques for estimating the power spectrum are similar to those\nalready employed in CMB and galaxy redshift surveys. Here\nwe adapt them to weak lensing. \n\nThe paper is organised as follows: We start by describing the features\nof our algorithm. In $\\S3$, we review the basic formalism of weak\nlensing, while $\\S4$ describes the simulations used in the paper. We\nthen examine each of our chosen weak lensing applications, image\nreconstructions ($\\S5$), cluster detections ($\\S6$), and power spectrum\nestimation ($\\S7$ ). We conclude in $\\S8$. The numerical algorithms used\nin this paper are described in the Appendix."

        "question": "What factors determine whether charged particles can form stable off-equatorial orbits in the coronae around black holes and neutron stars?",
        "introduction": "\\label{Sec:Intro}\nThe role of magnetic fields near strongly gravitating objects has been\nsubject of many investigations \\citep[e.g.][]{punsly08}. They are relevant for \naccretion disks that may be embedded in large-scale magnetic fields, for\nexample when the accretion flow penetrates close to a neutron star\n\\citep{lipunov92,halo2_11}. Outside the main body of the accretion\ndisk, i.e.\\ above and below the equatorial plane, the accreted material\nforms a highly diluted environment, a `corona', where the density of\nmatter is low and the mean free path of particles is large in comparison\nwith the characteristic length-scale, i.e.\\ the gravitational radius of\nthe central body, $R_{\\rm g}\\equiv GM/c^2\\approx 1.5(M/M_\\odot)\\;$km,\nwhere $M$ is the central mass. The origin of the coronal flows and the\nrelevant processes governing their structure are still unclear. In this\ncontext we discuss motion of electrically charged particles outside the\nequatorial plane.\n\nOff-equatorial, energetically bound motion of charged particles in\nstrong gravitational and electromagnetic fields is pertinent to the\ndescription of accretion disk coronae around black holes and compact\n(neutron) stars. In our previous papers \\citep{halo1, halo2}  we\ndiscussed the existence of energetically-bound stable orbits of charged\nparticles occurring outside the equatorial plane, extending thus a large\nvariety of complementary studies\n\\citep[e.g.,][and further references cited therein]{halo2_4,halo2_5,halo2_3,halo2_6,aliev02}. Particles on\noff-equatorial stable trajectories form a coronal flow that is possible\nat certain radii and for certain combinations of the model parameters,\nnamely, the specific charge of the particles, the conserved energy and\nthe angular momentum of the particle motion, the strength and\norientation of the magnetic field, and the spin of the central body.\n\nWe assume that the magnetic field permeating the corona has a\nlarge-scale (ordered) component \\citep{bisnovatyi07}. In this case,\ncharged particles can be trapped in toroidal regions, extending symmetrically\nabove and below the equatorial plane and forming two halo lobes. However,\nthis trapping happens only for certain combinations of model parameters\n\\citep{halo2}.\n\nWe consider two types of the model setup: a rotating (Kerr) black hole\nin an asymptotically uniform magnetic field parallel to the symmetry\naxis \\citep{wald,tomimatsu01,koide04,koide06}, and a non-rotating star (described\nby the Schwarzschild metric) endowed with a rotating magnetic dipole\nfield \\citep{petterson,sengupta}. Both cases can be regarded as integrable \nsystems with the electromagnetic field acting as a perturbation.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.6, clip]{fig1a.eps}\\includegraphics[scale=0.61, clip]{fig1b.eps}\n\\caption{In the left panel we present a poloidal section of the\nselected isocontours of the effective potential\n$V_{\\rm{}eff}(r,\\theta)$, eq.\\ (\\ref{effpot}),  for a charged\nparticle ($\\tilde{q}\\tilde{Q}=2$, $\\tilde{L}=5\\;M$) on the Kerr background\n($a=0.5\\;M$). We assume  the presence of Wald uniform magnetic field\n($\\tilde{q}B_{0}=2M^{-1}$). The off-equatorial potential lobes\nare present, allowing stable motion. Two exemplary trajectories of\ntest particles are shown -- in the left lobe a chaotic orbit of energy\n$\\tilde{E}=1.796$, while in the right lobe the regular, purely\noff-equatorial trajectory of $\\tilde{E}=1.78$. Both particles were\nlaunched at $r(0)=3.11$, $\\theta(0)=\\pi/4$ with $u^r(0)=0$ and their\ntrajectories interweave with each other.  We plot the poloidal\n$(r,\\theta)$ projection of the trajectory; what appears as a lobe in the\npoloidal plane is an axially symmetric 3-dimensional rotational\nstructure. The latter is illustrated in the right panel where the case\nof the off-equatorial regular trajectory is shown.}\n\\label{fig1}\n\\end{figure*}\n\nThe above-mentioned lobes are defined by the figures of the effective\npotential in the poloidal plane. These were previously studied in the\ncontext of charge separation that is expected to occur in pulsar\nmagnetospheres \\citep[e.g.][]{neukirch93}. Here, we address whether the\ntrajectories within these lobes are regular (i.e., whether the system is\nintegrable), or if they instead exhibit a chaotic behavior. A related\nproblem was studied recently by \\citet{japonci} in an attempt to find a\nconnection between chaoticness of the motion and the spin of a rotating\nblack hole residing in the center. These authors suggest that chaotic\nbehavior occurs for certain values of the black hole spin, while for\nothers the system is indeed regular.\n\nThe idea of investigating the connection between the spin of a black\nhole and chaoticness of motion of matter near its horizon is very\ninteresting for the following reason. Because of high degree of symmetry of the background\nspacetime, the unperturbed motion is regular \\citep{carter}; no chaos is\npresent. The electromagnetic perturbation may trigger the chaos,\nhowever, its effect can be expected to diminish very near the horizon,\nwhere strong gravity of the black hole should prevail. This is also the\nregion where the spin effects are most prominent. Further out various\nother influences become important due to distant matter and the\nturbulence in accreted material. Therefore the connection between the spin\nand the motion chaoticness is best applicable in the immediate vicinity\nof the black hole, i.e.\\ within the inner parts of corona.\n\nThe recurrence analysis \\citep{marwan} provides us with a powerful tool\nfor the investigation of complex dynamical systems. The method examines\nthe recurrences of the system to the vicinity of previously reached\nphase space points. It has been typically adopted to study the\nexperimental data, where often only some (if not just one) of the phase\nspace variables are known from the measurements. Takens' embedding\ntheorems \\citep{takens} are then used to reconstruct the phase space\nportrait of such a system. In our study we are equipped with the full\nphase space trajectory from the numerical integration of the equations\nof motion, so that we can use the recurrence analysis directly.\n\nIt appears that the method of Recurrence Plots has not been employed in\nthe context of relativistic astrophysical systems yet. To this end, one\nneeds a consistent definition of the neighborhood of a point in the\nphase space in a curved spacetime. Below, we discuss the phase space distance\nand suggest a form of the distance norm suitable in such circumstances.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In sec.\\ \\ref{pohrce} we review the\nequations of particle motion, which we then integrate to obtain\ntrajectories. In sec.\\ \\ref{ra} we introduce the basic properties of\nRecurrence Plots. Sec.\\ \\ref{sectionwald} analyses the motion around a\nKerr black hole endowed with a uniform magnetic test field. We employ\nPoincar\\'e surfaces of section and Recurrence Plots. The two approaches\nallow us to show the onset of chaos in different, complementary ways. We\nexamine  the motion in off-equatorial lobes, pay special attention to\nthe spin dependence of the stability of motion, and we notice the\nemergence of `potential valleys' that allow the particles to escape from\nthe equatorial plane along a narrow collimated corridor. Analysis of the\noff-equatorial motion around a magnetic star is presented in sec.\\\n\\ref{sectionmagnetized}. We consider a dipole-type magnetic  field,\nwhich sets different limits on the off-equatorial range of allowed\nmotion of charged particles. It also defines different regimes of\nchaoticness in comparison with the uniform magnetic field. Finally,\nresults of the analysis are summarized in sec.\\ \\ref{concl}.\n\n\\begin{figure*}[htb]\n\\centering\n\\includegraphics[scale=0.55, clip]{fig2.eps}\n\\caption{The overview of possible topologies of the off-equatorial\npotential structure above the event horizon (thick line in plots) of\nKerr black hole endowed with the Wald test field.}\n\\label{wald_abc}\n\\end{figure*}"

It is not clear whether AGN represent episodic phenomena in the life of galaxies, are random\nprocesses (given that the Supermassive Black Hole is already there), or are more fundamental. \nSome authors claim that AGN are\nkey in quenching the star formation bursts in their host galaxies \\citep{Granato04,Springel05}.\nIt has also been shown that the mass dependence\nof the peak star-formation epoch appears to mirror the mass dependence of Black Hole (BH) activity, \nas recently seen in redshift surveys of both radio-and X-ray-selected active \ngalactic nuclei \\citep{Waddington01,Hasinger03b}.\nFor these reasons, searching for signatures of AGN feedback in \nthe properties of AGN host galaxies is one of the most promising ways of testing the role of AGN in galaxy evolution. \n\nOne way of finding variations in the AGN population with redshift is to compare their SEDs \ndefined over a broad wavelength range. The SED of an AGN can reveal the presence of the underlying \ncentral engine, together with the luminosity of the host galaxy, the reddening, and\nthe role of the star formation in the various frequency regimes. SED determination in samples of\nAGN at different redshifts is an efficient method to search for evolutionary trends.\nAccuracy in the photometry and a filterset spanning a broad wavelength range are required to characterize correctly  \ndifferent types of AGN. \n\n\nMultiwavelength surveys are fundamental in the study of active galactic nuclei, since these appear \nconsiderably\ndifferent depending on the wavelength range of consideration. The hard X-ray selection of AGN using \ndeep observations is one of the most reliable methods of finding AGN \\citep{Mushotzky04}, although a percentage of them  \nremains undetected using this technique \\citep{Peterson06}, specially the most highly obscured objects.\nFor this reason, it is important to characterize AGN at different wavelength ranges, \nin order to be capable of identifying them by more than one selection technique, and to distinguish between\nthe different groups of active nuclei, including those that could be contaminated, or even hidden, by starbursts. \nMid-infrared surveys have been very successful in finding X-ray undetected AGN in large numbers, \nbut in this case it \nis crucial to distinguish the AGN from the non-active star-forming galaxies. This can be achieved  \nusing typical mid-infrared colors of AGN \\citep{Lacy04,Stern05,Alonso06,Donley08} or by combining mid-infrared \nand radio detections \\citep{Donley05,Alonso06,Martinez-Sansigre05,Martinez-Sansigre07,Lacy07,Park08}.\n\n\nThe Extended Groth Strip ($\\alpha$ = 14$^{h}$ 17$^{m}$, $\\delta$ = 52$^{o}$ 30') enlarges the Hubble Space\nTelescope Groth-Westphal strip \\citep{Groth94} up to 2$^{o}$x15', having the advantage of\nbeing a low extinction area in the northern sky, with low galactic and zodiacal infrared emission, and\ngood schedulability by space observatories. For these reasons, there is a huge amount of public data at\ndifferent wavelength ranges that only require to be compiled and cross-correlated in a consistent way.\nThe overall majority of the observational work in the EGS\nhave been coordinated by the AEGIS proyect\\footnote{The AEGIS project is a collaborative effort to obtain both \ndeep imaging covering all major wavebands from X-ray to radio and optical spectroscopy over a large area \nof sky. http://aegis.ucolick.org/index.html} \\citep{Davis07}. \n\n\nWith the huge amount of data available for this region of the sky, we have constructed a robust AGN sample, \ndetected in the X-rays and in the mid-infrared, intermediate in depth and area in comparison with other surveys\n\\citep{Jannuzi99,Dickinson01,Lonsdale03,Eisenhardt04,Franceschini05}.\nThe photometry has been performed over the publicy available images, in several bands, in order to compile\nas best-sampled SEDs as possible.\nThe biggest advantage of our AGN sample, compared with other works, is the robustness of the photometry, \nperformed in a consistent way among the different bands, and its multiwavelength nature: it is the most complete \ncompilation of data for such a big sample of AGN in the EGS. This allows us to determine accurate photometric redshifts, \nand to distinguish clearly between the different groups of AGN.\nWe have used a comprenhensive set of AGN plus starburst templates \nfrom \\citet{Polletta07}, to fit the SEDs of the galaxies in the sample, \nand to separate them in five different main groups. Through this classification, we can study the properties \nof the different types of AGN in this sample.\nSection 2 describes the sample and the cross-matching of the multiwavelength data, Section 3 explains the  \ntechnique of classification of AGN based on the fit of their spectral energy distributions, in Section 4 the \nresults of this paper are discussed, and finally in Section 5 the main conclusions are summarized.\nThroughout this paper  we assume an \nH$_{0}$=75 km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ and a $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology with $\\Omega_{m}$=0.3 and \n$\\Omega_{\\Lambda}$=0.7."

        "question": "What is the relationship between the metallicity of halo stars and their distribution in action space?",
        "introduction": "Samples of halo stars near the Sun provide us with accessible\ndocumentation on the early history of the Galaxy.  But, like medieval\npalimpsests, the manuscript pages have been overwritten. Dissipative\nevents, such as the assembly of the Galactic disk, and dissipationless\nprocesses, such as phase-mixing in the time-evolving Galactic\npotential, make the text difficult to read.  Nonetheless, the spatial\ndistribution, kinematics and chemistry of local halo stars provides us\nwith important evidence on the nature and timescale of events in the\nearly history of the Galaxy, if we could but decode and interpret it.\n\nActions are invariant under slow changes~\\citep[e.g.,][]{Go80}. They\nhave often been suggested as the natural coordinates for galactic\ndynamics~\\citep{Bi82,Bi87}, in which of course the potential is\nevolving in time (though possibly not slowly).  One of the advances\nover the last few years has been the development of fast numerical\nmethods to compute actions in general axisymmetric\npotentials~\\citep{Bi12,Bo15,Sa16}. For the first time, this allows\n  the study of the local halo in action space using realistic Galactic\n  potentials comprising disks (both stellar and gas), halo and\n  bulge~\\citep{Mc17}. The only other work known to us that displays\n  the local halo in action space is the pioneering paper of\n  \\citet{Ch00}. These authors worked with a much smaller sample of\n  stars ($\\sim 1000$) and out of necessity used a global St{\\\"a}ckel\n  potential as a model of the Galaxy, as their work predated fast\n  numerical action evaluators.\n\nIn this {\\it Letter}, we map the halo stars in action space using\n  a new dataset, the SDSS--{\\it Gaia} catalogue. This has six-dimensional \n  phase space information for 62\\,133 halo stars, an order of magnitude\n  larger than previous studies of the local halo. We use this new\n  dataset, coupled with the recent advances in action evaluation, to\n  provide new maps of the local halo in action space, which\n  graphically illustrate the dichotomy between the metal-rich and\n  metal-poor stars.  We identify two new components of the\n  halo. First, there is a high energy retrograde component that is\n  limited to the metal-rich stars. Although retrograde stars have been\n  identified before~\\citep{Ma12,He17}, we show here that they are\n  largely restricted to metallicities in the range $-1.9 < $ [Fe/H] $<\n  -1.3$. Second, we provide strong evidence for the existence of a\n  resonant component. It is present across all metallicities, and it\n  has a strong spatial dependence, which satisfies the characteristics\n  of a dynamically induced resonance. This resonance may be linked to\n  a well-known resonance in disk stars, which causes the Hercules\n  Stream. The presence of resonant stars at such low metallicities has\n  not been seen before. We conclude with a discussion of how these\nfindings are related to fundamental events in the Galaxy's early\nhistory.\n\n\\begin{figure*}\n    \\includegraphics[width=180mm]{fig2.png}\n  \\caption{Histograms of the stellar halo in action space\n    ($J_R,J_\\phi$), ($J_R,J_z$) and ($J_\\phi,J_z$) split into\n    metal-rich (left column, $-1.6<$ [Fe/H] $< -1.1$) and metal-poor\n    (middle column, $-2.9 <$ [Fe/H] $< -1.8$).

        "question": "What is the efficiency of identifying gravitationally lensed galaxies by selecting bright submillimeter sources in wide-area surveys?",
        "introduction": "Gravitational lensing increases the angular size and integrated flux\nof affected sources.  It is exploited to investigate the mass\ndistribution of the foreground lensing structures as well as the\nproperties of the background lensed galaxies \\citep[see reviews\nby][]{Bartelmann10, Treu10R}.\n\n \nThe magnification provided by gravitational lensing makes it an\neffective tool for identifying and studying intrinsically faint and\ntypically distant galaxies \\citep[e.g.][]{Stark07, Richard08,\n  Richard11}.  The flux boost from lensing yields an improved\ndetection and the associated spatial enhancement increases the ability\nto investigate the internal structure of distant galaxies to levels\notherwise unattainable with the current generation of instrumentation\n\\citep[e.g.][]{Riechers08, Swinbank10, Swinbank11, Gladders12}.\nFurthermore, gravitational lensing probes the total mass of the\nforeground deflectors, including the relative content of dark and\nluminous mass. In combination with dynamical studies, lensing mass\nreconstruction allows one to obtain the density profile of the dark\nmatter in individual lensing galaxies down to $\\sim10$\\,kpc scales\n\\citep[e.g.][]{MiraldaEscude95, Dalal02, Metcalf02, Rusin05, Treu04}.\n\nThe statistics of galaxy-galaxy lensing events, particularly the\nabundance of strongly lensed sources from a sample of galaxies with a\nknown redshift distribution, can be used to constrain the global\ncosmological parameters, such as the cosmological constant. For\nexample, the 28 lensed quasars in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nQuasar Lens Search (SQLS) led to an estimate of $\\Omega_\\Lambda=0.74\n\\pm 0.17$, assuming a spatially flat Universe \\citep[][]{Oguri12}.  A\nsystematic search for large samples of lensed galaxies could provide\nconstraints on cosmological parameters that are competitive with other\ncosmological probes \\citep[e.g.][]{Marshall09}.\n\nThe past decade has seen dedicated optical and radio imaging and\nspectroscopic surveys for background sources strongly lensed by single\nforeground galaxies (so-called strong galaxy-galaxy lensing).  These\ninclude the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS; \\citealt{Bolton06}), SQLS\n\\citep{Oguri06}, Strong Lens Legacy Survey (SL2S;\n\\citealt{More12,Ruff11}), and the BOSS Emission Line Lens Survey\n(BELLS, \\citealt{Brownstein12}) in the optical and the Cosmic Lens All\nSky Survey (CLASS; \\citealt{Browne03}).  Unfortunately, in order to\nconvert the lensing rate into a test of cosmological models,\ncosmological studies require that the selection function be simple and\neasy to describe.  Furthermore, the initial selection of candidates is\noften inefficient or the resulting targets are biased to low\nredshifts. For example, at radio wavelengths $\\sim0.2\\%$ of the\ninitial targets of CLASS are lensed \\citep{Browne03}, although this\ncan be improved to $\\sim2\\%$ by including SDSS information in the\ninitial target selection \\citep{Jackson07}.  SDSS-based lensing\nsearches are more efficient, but are limited to lensed galaxies with\n$z\\la0.7$ due to the survey depth \\citep{Treu04, Koopmans06,\n  Bolton08a, Bolton08b, Auger10b, Brownstein12}.\n\nIt has long been proposed that large samples of gravitationally\nlensed, high-redshift galaxies can be efficiently selected by\nsearching for bright sources in wide area blank-field submillimeter\nsurveys \\citep[e.g.][]{Blain96, Perrotta02, Negrello07, Paciga09}.\nThe unique advantage of selecting bright submillimeter sources as\nlensed galaxy candidates lies in the efficiency of this technique and\nthe low contamination of samples.  The number counts of distant\nsubmillimeter galaxies (SMGs) have intrinsically steep slopes at\nbright flux densities \\citep[e.g.][]{Barger99, Blain99, Coppin06,\n  Scott06, Patanchon09, Weiss09, Glenn10, Oliver10, Clements10}.\nThus, a population of apparently bright 500\\,\\micron\\ sources is\nexpected to be dominated by gravitationally lensed sources, local\nlate-type galaxies and flat spectrum radio quasars \\citep[or\nblazars;][]{Negrello07}.  The two contaminants can be easily removed\nby cross-identifying the bright submillimeter sources with shallow\nall-sky optical and radio surveys \\citep[e.g.][]{Negrello10}.\n\nWith the launch of the \\herschel\\ Space\nObservatory\\footnote{\\herschel\\ is an ESA space observatory with\n  science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator\n  consortia and with important participation from NASA.}\n\\citep{Pilbratt10} blank-field submillimeter surveys of\nhundreds of square degrees are being undertaken for the\nfirst time \\citep[e.g.][]{Oliver12, Eales10}, making systematic\nsearches for strong galaxy-galaxy lensing practical.  The first\nsystematic \\herschel\\ survey for lensed SMGs was undertaken with\n\\herschel-Astrophysical Terahertz Large Area Survey (H-ATLAS;\n\\cite{Eales10}) Science Demonstration Phase (SDP) data. In that study\n\\citet{Negrello10} identified a total of 12 sources with 500\\,\\micron\\\nflux density, $S_{500}$,$>100$\\,mJy in 14.4\\,deg$^2$. Seven of the\nsources are associated with $z<0.1$ late-type galaxies or radio-loud\nblazars and the five remaining sources were confirmed as systems\nundergoing strong galaxy-galaxy lensing. Thus, \\citet{Negrello10}\nshowed that one can reach $\\sim100\\%$ efficiency in the identification\nof strongly lensed galaxies, simply based on an observed submillimeter\nflux cut and existing all-sky survey data.  The five \\atlas\\ lensed\nsystems have since been subject to extensive analysis and follow-up\neffort \\citep{Frayer10, Hopwood11, Lupu10, Omont11, Valtchanov11}.\n\nAdditional gravitationally lensed SMGs have since been identified in\nother extragalactic surveys with the Spectral and Photometric\nImaging Receiver (SPIRE; \\citealt{Griffin10, Swinyard10}) on \\herschel.\nThese include the $z=2.957$ \\hermes\\ source, HLock01\n\\citep[Section~\\ref{sec:l1}; ][]{Conley11, Gavazzi11, Riechers11,\n  Scott11}, and the \\atlas\\ galaxies ID141 ($z=4.24$; \\citealt{Cox11}),\nand HATLAS12--00 ($z=3.259$; \\citealt{Fu12}).  In addition,\n\\citet{Harris12} used \\aco\\ linewidths and integrated luminosities to\nshow that 11 lensed galaxies from \\atlas\\ are, on average, magnified by\nfactors of 10, with a range of $\\sim 3$--20 for individual sources.\n\\citet{GonzalezNuevo12} recently showed that \\herschel-SPIRE data can\nbe used to identify fainter lensed galaxies, although the selection\nprocess is necessarily more involved, and will not be discussed further\nhere.  Outside of \\herschel, a recent South Pole Telescope (SPT;\n\\citealt{Carlstrom11}) survey of the cosmological millimeter background\nidentified 13 discrete sources in\n  87~deg$^2$ that are consistent with gravitationally lensed galaxies\nat high redshift. These sources are \n  detected at $>4.5\\sigma$ ($\\sim 15$~mJy) at 1.4~mm, have 1.4 to\n  2.0~mm spectral indices consistent with thermal dust emission, and\n  were not detected by IRAS \\citep{Vieira10}.\n\nIn order to build-up large samples of strongly lensed SMGs it is\nclearly necessary to test the supposition that high efficiency can be\nreached with only a flux cut and existing shallow optical and radio\ndata.  In this paper, we present a systematic survey for a sample of\nstrongly lensed SMGs in $\\sim95\\,{\\rm deg}^2$ of the \\herschel\\\nMulti-tiered Extragalactic\nSurvey\\footnote{http://hermes.sussex.ac.uk/} \\citep[\\hermes;][]{\n  Oliver12} data.  In the $\\sim95\\,\\rm{deg}^2$ of \\hermes\\ blank-field\ndata 13 principal and 29 supplementary candidate lensed SMGs are\nidentified.  We describe a simple statistical lensing model,\nconsisting of a foreground matter distribution and background SMGs,\nand show that the observed lensed number counts are consistent with\nthe model prediction.\n\nWe have begun a follow-up multi-wavelength campaign to further\nunderstand the nature of the candidate lensed SMGs. Detailed\nobservations of nine of the sources, are presented, and these\nestablish that they are all gravitationally lensed.  Follow-up data is\navailable for four of the 29 secondary candidates, of which only one\nis confirmed to be lensed; one is an intrinsically luminous galaxy;\none is a blend of multiple sources in the \\herschel\\ beam; and the\nnature of the other is unclear.\n\nIn this paper we focus on the ensemble properties of the primary\nlensed candidate list and consider statistics such as the lensing\nrate, number counts, and submillimeter color and redshift\ndistributions of the lensed SMGs.  In order to facilitate community\nparticipation in the follow-up observations we also present the\ncatalogs of our primary and secondary candidate lensed sources.\nFuture publications will present detailed analysis of individual\nsystems, including lensing mass models and properties of both the\nforeground and background galaxies, similar to the detailed\npresentation in \\citet{Fu12}.  The paper is organized as follows: the\nselection of the candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies is\ndescribed in Section~\\ref{sec:sample}, and their basic properties are\ndiscussed in Section~\\ref{sec:prop}.  In Section~\\ref{sec:model} we\npresent a simple statistical model of the lensing rate and discuss the\nmodel predictions for the population of strongly lensed 500-\\micron\\\nselected sources. Follow-up data are described in\nSection~\\ref{sec:followup} and lensed candidates are discussed on a\nsource-by-source basis in Section~\\ref{sec:indi}.  Individual\nsupplementary candidate gravitationally lensed galaxies are discussed\nin Appendix~\\ref{app:sources}.

The Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey \\citep[BOSS: ][]{2013AJ....145...10D,2011AJ....142...72E} observed a specific part of the galaxy population, the most massive ellipticals at redshift 0.57, by selecting in the color-color diagram $g-r$, $r-i$ \\citep{2013MNRAS.435.2764M}. BOSS is the first to measure the Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation standard ruler at the percent level\\citep[BAO:][]{2003ApJ...598..720S}, which\ndirectly constrains the cosmological model \\citep{2014MNRAS.441...24A}. The WiggleZ survey targeted star-forming galaxies at redshift 0.6 \\citep{2010MNRAS.401.1429D} and measured the BAO standard ruler at the 5 \\% level \\citep{2014MNRAS.441.3524K}. Finally, the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey \\citep[VIPERS,][]{2014A&A...566A.108G} observed galaxies at redshift 0.8 and measured the growth rate of structure at the 17\\% level \\citep{2013A&A...557A..54D}. \n\nMeasuring standard rulers and the growth rate of structure is key to understand the cosmological model \\citep{2013PhR...530...87W}, but this does not require the galaxy sample to be volume limited.\nAs illustrated by the measurement of the BAO feature using samples that are not volume limited, such as the Ly$\\alpha$ forest of quasars \\citep{2015A&A...574A..59D} or the WiggleZ survey, the BAO feature is an intrinsic property of the matter field and does not require a volume-limited sample. However, it is mandatory to understand in depth how the selected tracers are related to the dark matter field \\citep{2015JCAP...05..060B,2015MNRAS.449.1454P,2015arXiv150704356F,2015arXiv150906404R}. Furthermore, \\citet{2014MNRAS.442.2131A} found that galaxy formation effects, such as the selection function or bias models, can bias the BAO scale measurement at the 0.2\\% level, which is well below the expected precision by eBOSS.\nTherefore, we can spectroscopically observe any tracer of the matter field. In particular, we can choose any type of galaxy that is believed to be a Poisson sampling of the underlying density field, provided its density is sufficient to overcome the shot noise and that accurate redshifts can be obtained in a short time, so that a large ($>h^{-3}$Gpc$^3$) volume can be covered within a few years of observations.\n\nThe extended Baryonic Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey \\citep[eBOSS,][]{2015arXiv150804473D} uses color selection to identify three types of galaxies: luminous red galaxies \\citep[LRGs,][]{2015arXiv150804478P}, emission-line galaxies (ELGs), and quasars \\citep[QSOs,][]{2015ApJS..221...27M}. The ELG and QSO samples will not provide volume-limited samples. \n eBOSS will measure the angle-averaged BAO distance ladder with point-like tracers to the 1\\% precision at redshift 0.7 using LRGs , 2.2\\% at redshift 0.87 using ELGs (or d$_A$(z) to an accuracy of 3.1\\% and H(z) to 4.7\\%), and 1.6\\% at redshift 1.37 using QSOs \\citep{2015arXiv150804473D,2016MNRAS.457.2377Z}. We expect to reach this measurement by acquiring 195,000 emission line galaxy redshifts at an effective redshift of z = 0.87 using 300 dedicated plates. The efficiency of the targeting algorithm needs to be higher than $N(0.6<z_\\mathrm{reliable}<1)/N_\\mathrm{targets}>74.5\\%$ or $N(0.7<z_\\mathrm{reliable}<1.1)/N_\\mathrm{targets}>74.5\\%$ to obtain the correct amount of reliable redshifts in the range of interest. Additionally, the fraction of catastrophic redshifts in the range $0.6<z<1$ or $0.7<z<1.1$ must be below 1\\%. \n\nThe target selection of the ELG for BAO surveys is driven by the requirement to acquire as many spectra as possible in the smallest amount of observing time to maximize the volume covered by the survey. \nThe resulting precision on the measurement of the BAO scale is directly related to the effective volume sample, that is, the volume where the density of tracers is above shot noise. For a constant density as a function of redshift, increasing the area is the only handle to increase the effective volume. For a peaked redshift distribution, increasing the density also increases the effective volume by overcoming shot noise at the tails of the redshift distribution. \nThe trade-off of density vs. area was studied, and we found that targeting 340 ELG deg$^{-2}$ on 750 deg$^2$ or 170 ELG deg$^{-2}$ on 1,500 deg$^2$ would provide the same effective volume and therefore the same BAO measurement \\citep{2015arXiv150804473D}. \nWe present here the pilot data that were observed to investigate the possible target selection algorithms using photometric data sets  that are available on an area at least larger than 750 deg$^2$ and that can provide a density of targets, denoted $\\rho$, such as $170<\\rho<340$ deg$^{-2}$. These target selection algorithms must fulfill the redshift efficiency requirement mentioned above. \n\nFor both ELGs and QSOs, schemes that select targets for spectroscopy exist using either color selection \\citep{2013MNRAS.428.1498C,2010AJ....139.2360S} or higher dimensional algorithms \\citep{2016A&A...585A..50R,2012ApJ...749...41B}. \nTo assess algorithms, eBOSS tested them on a 10 deg$^2$ sky patch covered by many photometric surveys around $\\alpha\\sim36^\\circ$ and $\\delta\\sim-4.5^\\circ$. This region was indeed observed by the following surveys SDSS, CFHT-LS Wide, DES, SCUSS, and WISE \\citep[][respectively]{2012ApJS..203...21A,2012AJ....143...38G,2015MNRAS.446.2523B,1538-3881-150-4-104,2010AJ....140.1868W}.\n\nIn addition to finding the right algorithm, we face another challenge:\nwe need to develop the best targeting algorithm implementable with existing photometry to construct a homogeneous ELG sample. \n\nThis paper is included in a series of eBOSS papers. \\citet{2015arXiv150804473D} gave an overview of the eBOSS survey. \\citet{2016MNRAS.457.2377Z} provided the Fisher matrix forecast on the accuracy of the BAO and RSD measurements expected.

        "introduction": "}\nThe discovery of three X-ray transient ultracompact accreting millisecond pulsars (MSPs), XTE J1751-305 \\citep{mark02}, XTE J0929-314 \\citep{gall02}, and XTE J1807-294 \\citep{mark03a, mark03b} have demonstrated the existence of binary pulsar systems with low mass, $M_2 \\approx 10^{-2} \\msun$, donors.  These three ultracompact systems (here defined as binaries with orbital periods, $\\Torb<60$ min) are remarkably homogeneous, with measured $\\Torb=42.4,\\,43.6,\\,40.1$ min respectively, well below the minimum period for a system with a donor composed primarily of hydrogen \\citep{rapp82}.  Since the nature of the donors in these systems today depends on the prior evolution of the system, it is useful to discuss the potential formation mechanisms for these systems.\n\nBinary systems with $\\Torb<80$ min can form through at least two channels.  Stable mass transfer from an evolved main-sequence star \\citep{nels86, fedo89, pods02, nels03} or a He burning star \\citep{savo86} onto a neutron star (NS) is one mechanism.  In this scenario, the main-sequence star is brought into Roche lobe contact due to orbital angular momentum losses from magnetic braking at a time when the core has nearly completed H burning.  Such a system will evolve to orbital periods comparable to the ultracompact MSPs and can reach $\\Torb \\approx 10$ min \\citep{pods02, nels03}. \\citet{pods02} and \\citet{nels03} show that the resulting ultracompact binaries have donor masses  $M_2 \\approx 0.1-0.2 \\msun$ as they pass through $\\Torb\\approx 40$ min on their way towards a shorter period.  These masses are significantly greater than those measured in the ultracompact MSPs \\citep{gall02,mark02,bild02}.  However, systems evolving through 40 min on the way out from the period minimum have masses more in line with the measurements ($M_2 \\approx 0.01 \\msun$) and by this time the donors have become partially degenerate with core temperatures $T_c \\sim 10^5-10^6$ K \\citep{nels03}. \n\n The second scenario that may form ultracompact systems involves triggering a common envelope phase during an unstable mass transfer episode from the donor onto the NS. The core of the donor, either a He or C/O white dwarf (WD), and the NS spiral-in to shorter orbital periods until the envelope is expelled \\citep{pacz76}. Several authors have proposed binary evolution scenarios in which the system, after emerging from the common envelope phase, then suffers in-spiral due to gravitational wave (GW) emission and eventually re-establishes contact \\citep{iben85,rasi00,dewi02,yung02}.  During this long GW in-spiral, the WD will have had time to cool, setting the entropy of the donor at the onset of the second mass transfer phase \\citep{bild02}. \\citet{taur96} finds that a large fraction of the NS-WD binaries that undergo a common envelope phase will reach contact within 1 Gyr.  Even considering a longer 4 Gyr delay between the formation of the WD secondary and the onset of mass transfer, a He WD will have  $T_c \\approx \\ee{3}{6}-10^7$ K \\citep{alth97,drie99,sere01}, while a C/O WD will have  $T_c \\approx \\ee{2-3}{6}$ K \\citep{sala00}. The mass transfer time-scale at contact is much shorter than the WD cooling time-scale for these WDs so that the  initial entropy of these objects is the minimum attainable.  As noted by \\citet{bild02}, if these objects adiabatically expand under mass loss, their $T_c$ will have been reduced by a factor of $\\approx 15$ by the time they have reached $M_2 \\approx 0.01 \\msun$. \n\nIn addition to the evolutionary arguments that donors in the ultracompact MSPs have not reached a $T=0$ configuration, the system XTE J1751-305 provides observational evidence for a hot donor since, as noted by \\citet{bild02},  a fully degenerate companion composed of He or C can not fill its Roche Lobe (RL) in this system. Hence, in examining the donors in the ultracompact accreting MSPs, we need to consider them to be arbitrarily degenerate, low mass objects of evolved (He or C/O) composition. To further constrain the nature of these donors (for example, their $T_c$) requires knowledge of their mass-radius, $M$-$R$, relation.  For the compositions (He, C/O), mass ($\\sim 0.01 \\msun$) and $T_c$ ($\\sim 10^5-10^7$ K) ranges of relevance to these objects, the corresponding central densities, $\\rho_c$ ($\\sim 10^3 \\mathrm{g \\,cm^{-3}}$) are such that Coulomb and thermal contributions to the equation of state (EOS) provide non-negligible corrections to the degenerate electron pressure, impacting their \\MR relations. In this paper, we detail the \\MR relation for low-mass stellar objects of finite $T_c$, extending the \\MR relations of \\citet{zapo69} for $T=0$ objects. In particular, we make clear that there is a \\emph{continuous connection} between fully degenerate objects (i.e. WDs), fully convective low-mass stars (i.e. $n=3/2$ polytropes), and Coulomb dominated objects.\n\n We begin in \\S \\ref{sec:toymod} by constructing a simple model of these objects using an approximate EOS. Although crude, this model describes adequately the relevant physics and yields an analytic description of the qualitative behavior of the \\MR relations and how they are affected by Coulomb and thermal contributions to the EOS. We find that at finite $T_c$, arbitrarily degenerate sequences exhibit a two branch solution, a fact noted previously [e.g.,\\citet{cox68, cox64, hans71, rapp84}].  Further, for sufficiently high $T_c$, the sequence of solutions on these two branches exhibit a mutual end point at a \\emph{non-zero mass}, $\\Mmin$, below which equilibrium solutions do not exist.  When Coulomb contributions are small and electrons are non-relativistic, fully convective stellar models of arbitrary degeneracy are well represented by $n=3/2$ polytropes \\citep{haya63, stev91, burr93, usho98}. In \\S \\ref{sec:polytropes}, we review the role played by degeneracy in determining the \\MR relation for $n=3/2$ polytropes and the existence of a two branch solution for the polytrope \\MR relation.  Other authors have noted that for a given $M$, there is a maximum $T_c$ that such polytrope models may have \\citep{cox68, rapp84, stev91, burr93, usho98}.  We connect the existence of a maximum $T_c$ with that of $\\Mmin$.  In \\S \\ref{sec:adiabats}, we  construct realistic \\MR relations using an EOS for fully ionized plasmas. There we exhibit explicitly the impact of Coulomb physics on the \\MR relations.  Like the simplified and polytrope models, we find that the \\MR relations of this model exhibit a two branch solution and a non-zero $\\Mmin$ at high $T_c$. \n\nIn \\S \\ref{sec:binapps} we apply our stellar models to the ultracompact MSP systems.  For each of these systems, there is a donor (of some composition and $T_c$) which will fill the RL at the required $\\Torb$ for any given orbital inclination.  And, for a given composition, there is, in each system, a relation between orbital inclination and $T_c$.  We examine what constraints this places on the composition and $T_c$ of the donors in these systems.  For example, in XTE J1807-294, C and He donors can have any $T_c$, while an O donor's $T_c$ has a minimum value.  In XTE J1751-305, all He or C/O donors must be hot.  We also examine how the future evolution of these systems depends on donor composition and $T_c$ and highlight the fact that a multiple-valued \\MR relation leads to a multiple-valued relation between $\\Torb$ and the system's mass transfer rate, $\\Mdot$.  Finally, in the context of adiabatic evolution, we discuss the expected number distribution of ultracompact systems as a function of $\\Torb$.  In a steady state, this distribution depends almost solely on the response of the donor radius, $R_2$, to mass loss through the quantity  $\\nrm \\equiv d \\ln R_2/d \\ln M_2$. The increased importance of Coulomb physics in C/O donors alters $\\nrm$ as compared to He donors and the expected distribution for the two donor types differs dramatically. Depending on donor type, the relative number of systems at $\\Torb \\approx 40$ min as compared to those at $\\Torb \\approx 10$ min is $\\approx 60$ for He donors and $\\approx 160$ for C/O donors.  We conclude in \\S \\ref{sec:conc} by discussing future applications of and refinements to our models."

        "question": "What specific problem do one-dimensional photoionization models face when trying to explain the observed radio brightness temperature of HII regions and planetary nebulae?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}  \nThe emission-line spectra of planetary nebulae, HII regions and \nactive galactic nuclei have been largely used to derive\nthe physical conditions and elemental abundances in these\nobjects. An empirical method proposed by Peimbert \\& Costero (1969) \nis usually used, providing average values of  the electron temperature and  \ndensity of the emitting gas, as well as of the ionic fractions and   \nelemental abundances, from the observed emission-line intensities. \nSince the main mechanism powering the emitting regions is photoionization,\nnumerical simulations based on photoionization codes have also\nbeen used to study those objects. \n  \nSince the 1960's, photoionization codes have been developed and   \n became a powerful tool to analyze the emission-line  \nspectra of those objects. Presently, several such codes are  \navailable  (see, for instance,   \nFerland et al. 1995), one of the most popular being CLOUDY. \nUntil recently,  \nonly these one-dimensional(1-D) codes, assuming    \nspherical or plane-parallel symmetry, were available. In the  \nlast few years, some effort has been devoted to develop 3-D  \nsimulations (Gruenwald, Viegas \\& Brogui\\`ere 1997, Och, Lucy \\& Rosa 1998).    \n  \nThe 1-D photoionization codes have been used either to derive   \nthe general properties of a given class of emission-line objects or to  \nobtain a detailed analysis of selected objects. In the first case,  \na grid of models is used to create diagnostic diagrams where  \ntheoretical and observational data are compared. On the other hand,  \ndetailed analysis of a given object, with observations available in   \na large wavelength range, provide a test for the physical processes  \noccurring in the gas. However, even for HII regions \nand planetary nebulae,  which are surely powered by photoionization, \nthe usual 1-D models fail  \nto reproduce all their properties. The main problems are:   \n  \n(a) the observed  \nradio brightness temperature is lower than predicted by the models. To  \n overcome  \nthis problem, it is usual to include a filling factor in the calculations as  \nproposed by Osterbrock \\& Flather (1959).  \n   \n(b) the  \ndiscrepancy between the temperatures derived from the [O III] lines and from  \nthe Balmer lines is not explained by the models (see, for instance, Liu \\&  \nDanziger 1993). The discrepancy may be solved if the codes include  \neither condensations (Viegas \\& Clegg 1994) or    \nadditional heating to produce temperature fluctuations  \n(Mathis, Torres-Peimbert \\& Peimbert 1998 and references therein).   \n  \n(c) the discrepancy between the chemical abundances derived from  \nforbidden and permitted emission-lines (Kaler 1986, Peimbert,  \nStorey \\& Torres-Peimbert 1993),  \n which could be explained by the presence of condensations    \n(Viegas \\& Clegg 1994, Liu et al. 2000).  \n  \nRegarding active galactic nuclei, self-consistent  \nmodels reproducing both the  \nemission-line and continuum spectra of selected objects indicate  \nthat shocks are present in the narrow-line region (Contini, Prieto   \n\\& Viegas 1998a,b, Contini \\& Viegas 1999).  \n  \nIn the following, the main issues associated with photoionization  \nmodels are reviewed. In particular, models for the  \n well-known HII galaxy, I Zw 18, are discussed, and possible explanations  \nfor the discrepancy between model results and observational data  \nare suggested."

        "question": "What is the predicted fate of a metal-free star with a mass between 100 and 250 solar masses?",
        "introduction": "The existence of a very first generation of objects, namely Population III, \nhas been originally\npostulated by the presence of a noticeable amount of heavy elements\nin Population II stars (see, e.g., Carr, Bond, \\& Arnett 1984 and\nreferences therein) \nand has recently gained increasing importance\nowing to the discovery of intergalactic metals in the Ly$\\alpha$ forest\n(Cowie et al. 1995; Songaila \\& Cowie 1996). \nIn those respects, Population III objects need to be such \n massive stars that they can produce metals at the end of their evolution. \nRecent theoretical analyses on the evolution of metal-free stars predict that \nthe fate of the massive metal-free stars can be classified as follows\n (e.g., Heger, Woosley, \\& Waters 2000; Chiosi 2000; see also \n Portinari, Chiosi, \\& Bressan 1998 for the effects of mass loss.): \n(1) A star with a mass of $m \\gtrsim 250 M_\\odot$ \n collapses completely to a black hole (BH) without \n ejecting any heavy elements (Bond, Carr \\& Arnett 1984).\n(2) A star of $100M_\\odot \\lesssim m \\lesssim 250 M_\\odot$\n is partly or completely disrupted by \n electron-positron pair instability.\nFor $m \\gtrsim 150 M_\\odot$, the core completely disrupts,\n  and the whole core involving heavy elements\nis injected in the intergalactic medium.\nIf it is an extremely energetic event (a hypernova),\nit might lead to a gamma ray burst (GRB).\n(3) A star of $35M_\\odot \\lesssim m \\lesssim 100 M_\\odot$ \n probably collapses into a black hole.\n(4) A star of $10M_\\odot \\lesssim m \\lesssim 35 M_\\odot$ results\n in a type II supernova. \n\nPopulation III stars are related to various issues that are\ncurrently the object of considerable attention.\nThe luminous Population III stars could cause the reionization \nof the universe at redshifts $\\gtrsim 5$ \n(Couchman \\& Rees 1986; Fukugita \\& Kawasaki 1994; \nOstriker \\& Gnedin 1996; Gnedin \\& Ostriker 1997;\nHaiman \\& Loeb 1997; Miralda-Escud\\'{e} \\& Rees 1998; Gnedin 2000).\nAlternatively, moderately massive BHs as the end products of massive \nstars might coagulate into a super-massive BH, evolving to \nprimordial AGNs (Larson 2000). The accreting super-massive BHs \nmay be more responsible for cosmic reionization \n(Tegmark \\& Silk 1994; Sasaki \\& Umemura 1996; Haiman \\& Loeb 1998;\nValageas \\& Silk 1999). \nIn addition, Population III stars may play an important role \n in the early evolution of galaxies \n (e.g., Tegmark, Silk, \\& Blanchard 1994; Ostriker \\& Gnedin 1996)\n or the early formation of massive BHs of $\\sim 10^5 M_\\odot$\n (Umemura, Loeb, \\& Turner 1993).\nThey may be responsible for the observed abundance patterns\n of extremely metal-deficient stars\n (McWilliam et al. 1995; Ryan, Norris, \\& Beers 1996; \n Audouze \\& Silk 1995; Shigeyama \\& Tsujimoto 1998).\nFinally, if a significant number of MACHOs are ancient white dwarfs\n(M\\'{e}ndez \\& Minniti 2000), they may stem from low-mass \nPopulation III stars (Carr 1994; Larson 1998; Rees 1999). \nIn the light of all of such possible\nsignificant consequences,\nthe initial mass function (IMF) of Population III stars\nis an issue of undoubted importance.\n\nMany authors have studied the collapse\n of primordial clouds to estimate the masses of Population III stars\n (e.g., Matsuda, Sato, \\& Takeda 1969; Yoneyama 1972;\n Hutchins 1976; Silk 1977, 1983; Carlberg 1981; \n Palla, Salpeter, \\& Stahler 1983;\n Yoshii \\& Saio 1986; Nishi et al. 1998).\nThese studies have emphasized the importance of\n radiative cooling by H$_2$ molecules because the primordial gas \n is deficient in heavy elements, which are the most efficient\n coolants in present-day star formation.\nIn the first collapsed objects, baryonic gas is heated\n to temperatures above $10^3$ K during the contraction.\nThis enhances the H$_2$ formation rate\n and causes the H$_2$ abundance \n to rise from its initial value of $\\sim 10^{-6}$ to \n a quasi-equilibrium value of $10^{-4}\\sim 10^{-3}$\n(e.g., Palla et al. 1983; Lepp \\& Shull 1984; Haiman, Thoul \\& Loeb 1996).\nThus, H$_2$ molecules cool the gas to a temperature of \n $\\sim 500$ K.\nAs a result, the Jeans mass descends to a stellar mass\n and Population III stars can form in this way\n through fragmentation of the first collapsed objects.\nAlthough many elaborate analyses have been made, \nthe estimated masses of Population III stars\n have not been well converged.\nSeveral authors have suggested that Population III stars\n were low mass, \n whereas others have suggested that they were massive or \n very massive.\nThis discrepancy seems to come from most studies being\n restricted to highly simplified models such as \n homogeneous, pressureless, and/or spherical collapses.\n\nIn the bottom-up scenarios like cold dark matter (CDM) models,\n the first collapsed pregalactic objects should form \n at redshifts of $z\\sim 10-10^2$ and have masses of \n $10^5 \\sim 10^8M_\\odot$ (Tegmark et al. 1997).\nBecause of the asymptotic scale-invariance of the CDM density \nfluctuations, pregalactic clouds with this mass range could\nundergo a run-away collapse, forming cores of\n$\\sim 10^2 M_\\odot$\n (Abel et al. 1998; Abel, Norman, \\& Bryan 2000),\nor form mini-pancakes, fragmenting into pieces of\n$10^2 M_\\odot-10^3 M_\\odot$ (Bromm, Coppi, \\& Larson 1999).\nIn these calculations, one of the common features is\n the formation of a filamentary structure. \nFilamentary clouds are gravitationally unstable and likely to \n fragment into dense clumps. \nSuch dense clumps are expected to evolve into Population III stars.\nThe physics of the fragmentation of filamentary primordial clouds \nhas been studied analytically\n(Uehara et al. 1996) or by a one-dimensional numerical\nsimulation (Nakamura \\& Umemura 1999, hereafter Paper I).\nThese studies suggest that the minimum mass of Population III stars\nis of the order of $M_\\odot$. However,\nthe physical processes are still unclear to determine whether\nPopulation III stars can be far above $M_\\odot$ or \nbe eventually reduced to a few $M_\\odot$.\nThus, as a further step following Paper I, we here perform two-dimensional\nhydrodynamical simulations.\nAttention is focused on elucidating\nthe physical process of the fragmentation of\nprimordial gas filaments to assess the mass of Population III stars.\n\nIn Paper I, we pursued the radial contraction \n of primordial filaments and \nshowed that the filaments continue to contract\n quasi-statically, the temperatures staying nearly constant \n at $T\\sim 500$ K.\nWhen the cloud becomes optically thick to the H$_2$ lines,\n the radial contraction essentially stops.\nApplying a linear stability analysis,\n the fragmentation was expected to take place at that stage and \n the minimum masses of Population III stars\n were estimated as a few $M_\\odot$.\nThus, Population III stars were anticipated to be \n low-mass deficient compared to the present-day stars.\nIn this paper, we pursue the fragmentation processes of the filaments\n by means of two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations.\nThe present model is an improved version of Paper I.\nThe numerical model and method are described in \\S 2.\nNumerical results are given in \\S 3 and \\S 4.\nWe show that filaments with low initial density can fragment\n into dense clumps before the cloud becomes optically\n thick to the H$_2$ lines.\nThen, the masses of the clumps\ncould be much more massive than a few $M_\\odot$.\nHowever, relatively dense filaments result in clumps of a few $M_\\odot$.\nHence, in \\S 5, it is predicted that the initial mass function\n of Population III stars is likely to be bimodal. \nIn \\S 6, we discuss some implications for the first metal\n enrichment and baryonic dark matter."

        "question": "What type of radio galaxy is PKS 2153-69 classified as, and what does this classification indicate about its characteristics?",
        "introduction": "The morphology of a typical radio galaxy is strongly influenced by interactions\nbetween the relativistic jet that  originates at its nucleus and material in\nthe interstellar and intergalactic media.  This appears true at all stages of\nradio galaxy evolution.  In the GHz Peaked Spectrum and Compact Steep Spectrum\nobjects, in many cases thought to be radio  galaxies in the early stages of\nevolution \\citep{2003PASA...20...38S}, interactions between their jets and\ntheir nuclear environment have been observed\n\\citep[e.g.][]{2002RMxAC..13..196O}.  In the more mature, low-power FR-I type\nradio galaxies, entrainment of material by a relativistic jet has been\nsuggested as the mechanism responsible for their  expanding, decelerating jets\nand center-brightened radio lobes \\citep[e.g.][]{1994ApJ...422..542B}.  In\ncontrast, in the  higher-power FR-II radio galaxies, interactions between the\njets and the intergalactic medium terminate the jets in spectacular lobe\nhot spots, giving these radio galaxies their characteristic edge-brightened\nlarge-scale morphologies \\citep[i.e.][]{1991ApJ...383..554C, 1997A&A...328...12P}.\n\nThe jets themselves, and the interaction regions, produce emission via both thermal and  non-thermal mechanisms over a wide range of spatial scales, from sub-pc to Mpc.  Much of the detailed physics pertaining to relativistic jets in radio galaxies is still uncertain \\citep{de_young_04} and the complexity of the physics involved in interactions between these jets and their environments is underscored by a number of recent theoretical and numerical simulation studies \\citep[e.g.][]{2002ApJ...572..713H}.\n\nWith these considerations in mind it is immediately apparent that high spatial\nresolution, multi-wavelength  observations of radio galaxies are a prerequisite\nfor detailed investigations of the physical processes involved. The benefits of\nhigh spatial resolution, multi-wavelength observational studies of radio\ngalaxies are illustrated by recent work on the nearby radio galaxies Pictor A\n\\citep{2001ApJ...547..740W, 1997A&A...328...12P} and Centaurus A\n\\citep{2003ApJ...593..169H}.\n\nPKS 2153--69 is one of the few nearby and powerful radio galaxies, a transition\nFR-I/FR-II object \\citep{1998MNRAS.296..701F} at a redshift of $z = 0.0282$\n\\citep{1988MNRAS.235..403T}.  The proximity of PKS 2153--69 ($20\\pct$ closer than Pictor A) makes  it an ideal object in which to study a relativistic jet and its relationship to its environment.  As well as the  strong radio lobe\nhot spots typical of FR-II radio galaxies, PKS 2153--69 also contains one of the\nbest examples of  an interaction between a relativistic jet and an\nextra-nuclear cloud of gas \\citep{1987Natur.325..504T, 1988MNRAS.235..403T,\n1998MNRAS.296..701F, 1990iuea.rept..513F, 1988Natur.334..591D}.  Radio and \noptical imaging by \\citet{1998MNRAS.296..701F} and VLBI observations by\n\\citet{1996AJ....111..718T} have provided good evidence that a jet originating\nat the nucleus of the host galaxy impacts a cloud of gas in the outskirts of\nthe galaxy,  possibly the remnant of a merging galaxy.  Near the interaction\nsite, an optically emitting cloud (line and continuum) with a complex \nmorphology and ionization structure is seen.  \n\nIn this paper we present observations that address the twin goals of\nmulti-wavelength coverage and improved spatial resolution.  First, comprehensive\nChandra X-ray imaging observations of PKS 2153--69 are presented,  including\nanalyses of the major X-ray emitting regions of the system: the hot halo, the\nnucleus, the jet/cloud  interaction, and the lobe hot spots.  Second, high spatial resolution radio observations (VLBI) are presented  that are\ntargeted to the aforementioned regions of interest.  In particular, we present\nthe highest linear resolution observation of a radio galaxy lobe hot spot yet\nproduced.\n\nWe attempt to produce a coherent physical picture of the jet interaction\nregions in this radio galaxy by considering the Chandra X-ray data, the VLBI\ndata, archival HST data, and other published data.\n\nWe use the WMAP measured cosmology of $H_0 = 71 \\kmpspMpc$ and $\\Omega_\\Lambda\n= 0.73$ \\citep{2003ApJS..148....1B}.

        "introduction": "X-ray novae (XRNe) are a subclass of low mass X-ray binaries characterized by the exhibition of occasional outbursts with a recurrence time-scale of a few decades (see the reviews by van Paradijs \\& McClintock 1995; Tanaka \\& Shibazaki 1996; van Paradijs 1998). During the outburst state the optical spectrum of the companion star is overwhelmed by the light of the X-ray irradiated accretion disc surrounding the compact object. During the long intervals of quiescence, the X-ray luminosity falls by at least 5 orders of magnitude, rendering the spectrum of the secondary star detectable. This provides an ideal opportunity to obtain the system parameters, constrain the physical properties of both the compact object and companion star and hence cast light on the nature and origin of these binary systems (see e.g. Charles 1998). In this way it has been shown that $\\sim~75$~per cent of the XRNe harbour black holes. \n  \nCentaurus X-4 is a well-studied XRN. It was discovered during an X-ray outburst in 1969 (Conner, Evans \\& Belian 1969), and a second outburst ten years later allowed the identification of its optical counterpart which had brightened by $\\geq$~6 magnitudes (Canizares, McClintock \\& Gridlady 1980). A Type I X-ray burst was detected during the decline phase of the outburst (Matsuoka et al. 1980), indicating that the primary in this case is an accreting neutron star. Photometric and spectroscopic studies of the optical counterpart in its quiescent state led to the determination of a 15.1 hr orbital period (Chevalier et al. 1989; McClintock \\& Remillard 1990) and a $\\sim$~0.2~M$_\\odot$ mass function (Cowley et al. 1988). The secondary star was identified as a ${\\rm K}5-{\\rm K}7$ evolved main sequence star.\n\nThe Cen X-4 quiescent light curves show a double-humped modulation with a full amplitude of $\\sim$~0.15~mag (Cowley et al. 1988; Chevalier et al. 1989; McClintock \\& Remillard 1990) which is associated with the tidal distortion of the Roche-lobe-filling secondary star. McClintock \\& Remillard (1990), based on the phasing of the H$\\beta$ emission line radial velocity curve, suggested the presence of an accretion disc hotspot to explain the unequal maxima and unusual different depths of the minima in the {\\it V} and {\\it I} light curves. Star spots or X-ray heating of the K-star were also invoked to explain the long term changes observed in the light curves by Chevalier et al. (1989). Shahbaz, Naylor \\& Charles (1993) observed Cen X-4 in the IR, where the contamination of the ellipsoidal light curve by the accretion disc is minimized. Their fit of the {\\it H}-band light curve with an ellipsoidal model led to the determination of a low inclination ($31^{\\circ}-54^{\\circ}$) and a primary mass lying in the range $0.5-2.1$~M$_\\odot$. \n\nIn this paper we refine the system parameters and ephemeris of Cen X-4. From our higher resolution spectra we are able to determine the rotational broadening of the companion star for the first time. Finally, we investigate the H$\\alpha$ Doppler map of the system during the quiescent state."

        "question": "What is the typical brightness temperature of giant pulses emitted by the Crab pulsar?",
        "introduction": "\\label{intro}\n\nMost radio pulsars are characterised by a stable average pulse profile\nat a given sky frequency. The average profiles are formed by\nintegrating all pulses emitted by the star over a given time.  The\npulsed emission from the star is observed as individual pulses that\ncarry detailed information about the physics of the pulsar radio\nemission. These pulses can only be directly detected in a fewer than a\nthird of the known radio pulsars, mainly because of their weak\nnature. One of the remarkable features of the single pulse emission is\nthe occurrence of intense pulses called giant pulses, which are\ndefined as pulses with energy greater than 10 times the average pulse\nenergy. Furthermore, the giant pulses are very narrow compared to the\nwidth of average pulsed emission and result in a pulse intensity\ndistribution described by a power law. For example, in the radio\nemission of the young Crab pulsar, the giant-pulse widths are found to\nbe narrower than 0.4 ns, implying a high brightness temperature of\n$\\sim$10$^{41}$K \\citep{he07}, and the single pulse flux distribution\nfollows a power law with slope $-$3.3 \\citep{lcu+95}. Another example\nis the emission of single bright pulses from the young Crab-like\npulsar, PSR B0540$-$69 located in the Large Magellanic Cloud; the\npulsar is visible at radio wavelengths only by virtue of the star's\nintense giant pulse emission \\citep{jr03}. Similar bright and narrow\npulses were reported in the emission of very old millisecond pulsars\nsuch as PSR B1937+21 \\citep{cstt96} and B1821-24\n\\citep{rj01}. Concerted giant pulse searches in these older and short\nperiod pulsars have revealed more giant pulse sources e.g., PSRs\nJ1823-3021A and J0218+4232 \\citep{kbmo05,kbm+06}. The only common\nfeature of these pulsars is a strong magnetic field ($B_{LC}\n\\sim$10$^5$G) at the velocity of light cylinder, which is the limiting\nradius where the velocity of the co-rotating plasma and magnetic field\nlines is less than the speed of light.\n\nHowever, some studies propose giant pulse-like emission in\npulsars with a low magnetic field at the light cylinder e.g., $B_{LC}$\nin the 4--100 G range. For instance, the bright single pulse emission\nfrom PSRs B0031$-$07, J1752$+$2359, and B1112$+$50 at 40 and 111 MHz\n\\citep{ke04,ek05,ek03}. \\cite{kkg+03} also report bright pulses\nfrom PSR B1133$+$16 at 5 GHz. If these bright pulses are similar to\nthe classical giant pulses, this questions the requirement of a high\nvalue of $B_{LC}$ to produce giant radio pulse emission. After the\ninitial discovery, a detailed statistical analysis of the bright pulses\nin these low B$_{LC}$ pulsars has not been attempted, unlike the\nextensive studies of the giant pulses from the young pulsars and the\nmillisecond pulsars \\citep{lcu+95,kt00,kni07,kbmo06}.\n\nThe pulsars in this study also exhibit other interesting single pulse\nbehaviour: PSRs B1133$+$16, B0031$-$07, and B1112$+$50 show drifting\nsubpulses \\citep{bac73,tmh75,wsw86} and nulling\n\\citep{hr07,rit76,wsw86,viv95}. PSR B1133$+$16 also shows narrow\nemission features called microstructure \\citep{han72, cwh90,\n  lkwj98}. \n\nRadio pulsars in general show a negative spectrum \\citep{sab86} and a\nlow frequency spectral turnover \\citep{kms+78,mgj+94}. This implies\nthat pulsars are brighter at low sky frequencies, although the sky\ntemperature also increases, contributing significantly to the system\ntemperature. Moreover, microstructure and drifting subpulses can be\nmore easily studied at low frequencies when sufficient telescope\nsensitivity is available \\citep{cwh90}. Motivated by the possible\npresence of giant pulses and a rich single pulse behaviour in the\npulsars considered here and the availability of the Low Frequency\nFront Ends (LFFEs) at the WSRT, we undertook this study in the\n110--180 MHz frequency range. The flexible baseband recorder PuMa-II\n\\citep{kss08} and full coherent dedispersion, permitted a detailed\nsingle pulse study with high sensitivity and relatively high time\nresolution. Although these pulsars have been studied at low sky\nfrequencies before, we are able with our system to observe for much\nlonger and across a far wider frequency range. Our long observations\nare useful in determining the flux distribution and the occurrence\nrates of bright pulses. Furthermore, the wide frequency coverage\npermits the computation of the pulsar spectra in this band.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organised as follows. The observations, the\npulsar fluxes, and spectra are described in Sects. \\ref{obs} and\n\\ref{flux}. We present our revised values of the dispersion measure\n(DM) of two pulsars based on the narrow giant pulses in\nSects. \\ref{DM} and \\ref{bsp}. The single pulse intensity, energy\ndistributions, and microstructure are the subjects of discussion in\nSects. \\ref{spa} and \\ref{microstructure}. We proceed with the pulse\ndrift analysis in Sect. \\sp\\ref{sss}, which is followed by our\ndiscussion and conclusions."

        "question": "What is the significance of the low redshift of the lens galaxy in Q 2237+0305 for microlensing variability timescales?",
        "introduction": "AGNs play a crucial role in the evolution of the Universe, but their internal structure remains \npoorly understood. The energy is generated by accretion onto a supermassive black hole (SMBH) \nthrough a disk, but the detailed structure of the disk \\citep[e.g.,][]{blaes04, blaes07}, the origin of \nthe non-thermal emissions \\citep[]{reynolds}, and the source of any outflows \\citep{Martin2000} are all topics of debate. \nAlthough simple thin accretion disk models describe some of the observed behavior, they do not reproduce all the observed \nfeatures \\citep[e.g.,][and references therein]{blaes07}. Testing accretion disk models is challenging in large \npart because of our inability to resolve the emission regions. \nReverberation mapping techniques \\citep[e.g.,][]{Brad93} strongly constrain the structure of the distant emission line \nregions, but not the continuum emission regions beyond the limits already set by time \nvariability \\citep[e.g.,][for modern models of optical variability]{Kelly2009, Szy2010, macleod2010}.\nFortunately, gravitationally lensed quasars provide us with a unique tool to zoom in on \nthe structure of AGN and explore their physics in more detail - a ``telescope'' that only becomes more powerful as the \ntarget source becomes smaller.\n\nMicrolensing magnification is caused by stars and white dwarfs in the lens galaxy close to the line of \nsight towards the lensed quasar images. It leads to uncorrelated flux variations due to the relative motions \nof the quasar, the lens, its stars, and the observer \\citep[see the review by][]{joachim-saas06}. The \nmicrolensing signal depends on the structural and dynamical properties of the source and the lens. Since the \nmagnification depends upon the size of the source, the simplest application of quasar microlensing is to measure \nthe size of quasar accretion disks. In essence, the \namplitude of the microlensing variability encodes the disk size, with larger disks showing lower variability\namplitudes. Given adequate light curves, this is now routine, with studies of the\nscaling of size with black hole mass \\citep{morgan10}, \nwavelength \\citep{timo2008,bate08,eigenbrod08,poindexter08,Floyd2009,ana09,ana11a,evencio11,jeff2011,Motta2012}\nand the nature of the emitting source \\citep[thermal or non-thermal X-ray emission,][]{pooley07,morgan08,\nchartas09,dai10,jeff2011,jeff2012f,jeff1104,morgan12}. Microlensing has also been used to explore the \nspatial structure of the broad line region (BLR) of quasars \n\\citep[e.g.,][]{Lewis98,Cristina02,Sluse07,Sluse11,ODowd10,guerras2012}, although the amplitudes of BLR lensing effects \nwill be small due to its large size \\citep[see][]{ana11b}.\n\nThe largest microlensing variability amplitudes are observed in the X-rays, as emphasized by \\cite{chartas02}, \n\\cite{dai2003}, and \\cite{pooley07}, indicating that this emission must arise close to the inner edge of the disk. Quantitative \nmicrolensing X-ray size estimates are now available for several systems \\citep[][]{dai10, morgan12, jeff2012f, jeff1104}, although the \nsparse data means that the measurements are largely upper limits because the likelihood distributions for the lower limits \nare prior dependent. \n\nThe well-known quadruple lensed quasar Q~2237$+$0305 \\citep{Huchra85} remains the best system for studying microlensing phenomena.  \nIn this system a $z_{S}=1.69$ background quasar is lensed by a nearby spiral galaxy at $z_L=0.039$ \nto form 4 images of the quasar. The images lie in the bulge of the galaxy, where the optical depth for microlensing is \nhigh and there is little dark matter. Furthermore, the low lens redshift leads to unusually short microlensing variability time scales ($\\sim$ months). \nMicrolensing fluctuations were first detected by \\cite{irwin89} and have now been monitored for well over a decade, \nprincipally by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment(OGLE) \\citep{wozniak2000, Udalski}.\nMoreover, due to the symmetry of the system, and the proximity of the lens galaxy, time delay corrections \nare negligible \\citep[$<1$ day,][]{dai2003,Vakulik,koptelova06} which simplifies analysis. Because of these characteristics, \nQ~2237$+$0305 has been the object of many studies, and monitored in different \nbands \\citep[e.g.,][]{wozniak2000,dai2003,Vakulik, timo2008,eigenbrod08, ana09,ODowd10}. Our X-ray studies \n\\citep{chen2011, chen2012}, some of which were independently analyzed by \\cite{Zimmer2011}, not only found evidence for \nmicrolensing variability but also for a dependence upon the X-ray continuum energy.\n\nIn this paper we present a complete analysis of the OGLE and \\cite{chen2011, chen2012} {\\it Chandra} data to set constraints \non the structure of the optical and X-ray emitting regions. We also compare our X-ray size estimates to those obtained \nfor HE 0435$-$1223 \\citep{jeff2012f},  QJ 0158-4325 \\citep{morgan12}, RXJ 1131$-$1231 \\citep{dai10} and HE 1104$-$1805 (Blackburne et al. 2012), \nto explore possible correlations of the X-ray sizes with BH mass. A summary of the observations, a description of the lightcurve fitting method, \nand a discussion of the main results is presented in Section \\ref{sec2}. In Section \\ref{sec3} we summarize the results and their \nimplications. Throughout this work we assume $\\Omega_m=0.3$, $\\Omega_{\\Lambda}=0.7$, and $H_0=72$ km sec$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$."

        "introduction": "The problem of the nature of the knee in the cosmic ray (CR) energy\nspectrum at 3~PeV and, in a more generic aspect, of the origin of CRs in\nthe PeV energy range stays open for many years now. Attempts to collate\narrival directions of CRs with coordinates of their possible\nastrophysical sources is one of the routes of investigations on the\nsubject. Another direction, which is being actively developed, is\nobservation of gamma rays from such sources.\n\nIn both approaches, the main subject of investigation are Galactic\nsupernova remnants (SNRs) since the model of diffusive shock acceleration\nat the outer front of expanding SNRs has become widely spread, see, e.g.,\na review by Hillas 2005. This does not imply though that there are no\nother astrophysical sources in the Galaxy that are able to accelerate\nhadrons to PeV and higher energies. In particular, the first results\ndemonstrating that pulsars can act as effective CR accelerators appeared\nsoon after the discovery of pulsars and their identification with neutron\nstars, see, e.g., Gunn~\\& Ostriker 1969. After this, interest to pulsars\nas possible sources of CRs with energies $\\gtrsim10^{14}$~eV up to the\nhighest energies did not vanish, see, e.g., Blasi \\etal\\ 2000; Giller~\\&\nLipski 2002; Bhadra 2003; Erlykin~\\& Wolfendale 2004; Bhadra 2006. Models\nconsidered included acceleration both in pulsar wind nebulae (e.g., the\nCrab nebula) and by isolated pulsars. It was demonstrated in particular\nthat the Geminga pulsar is a possible candidate for being the single\nsource of the knee at 3~PeV (Bhadra 2003).\n\nIn our previous works, we have already reported on the number of regions\nof excessive flux (REFs) found during an analysis of arrival directions\nof EAS registered with the EAS MSU array and the EAS--1000 prototype\narray (``PRO--1000'') and generated by CRs with energies of around PeV, \n(Kulikov~\\& Zotov 2004; Zotov~\\& Kulikov 2004, 2007, 2009). It was\ndemonstrated that there are no Galactic SNRs in the vicinity of some of\nthe REFs, though a considerable number of regions have isolated pulsars\nnearby. In Zotov~\\& Kulikov 2009, we pointed out that there are two\noverlapping REFs in the vicinity of a point with equatorial coordinates\n$\\alpha=285^\\circ$, $\\delta=58^\\circ$ in the EAS MSU and the PRO--1000\ndata sets. Taking into account possible errors in determination the\nboundaries of the REFs, one could consider them as one and the same\nregion with the pulsar PSR J1840+5640 inside (coordinates of the pulsar\n$\\alpha\\approx280.19^\\circ$, $\\delta\\approx56.68^\\circ$). There are\nneither supernova remnants or SNR candidates inside or close to the\nregion, nor open clusters or OB-associations, which are sometimes\nconsidered as possible sources of Galactic cosmic rays. PSR J1840+5640\nwas discovered back in 1980 (Shitov \\etal\\ 1980) and is a well-studied\nold radio-pulsar of the age of $17.5\\times10^6$ years located at 1.7~kpc\nfrom the Solar system, see, e.g., Arzoumanian \\etal\\ 1994; Hobbs \\etal\\\n2004.\n\nThis region attracted our attention once again after there appeared a\nlist of the brightest gamma-ray sources in the energy range from 100~MeV\nto 100~GeV registered during the first three month of operation of the\nFermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (Abdo \\etal\\ 2009a). It happened that\nthere is a pulsar (coordinates $\\alpha\\approx279.06^\\circ$,\n$\\delta\\approx59.46^\\circ$) of a new type near the REF, a so called\ngamma-ray-only pulsar, i.e., a pulsar that only ``blinks'' in gamma rays.\nThis pulsar as an intensive gamma-ray source was discovered by EGRET in\n1991--1993 but the nature of the source remained unclear (Nolan \\etal\\\n1994). It occurred to be the brightest unidentified gamma-ray source in\nthe energy ranges $>100$~MeV (significance level of $19.0\\sigma$) and\n$>1$~GeV ($14.2\\sigma$) located far from the Galactic plane (Galactic\nlatitude $b\\approx25^\\circ$), see Hartman \\etal\\ 1999; Lamb \\etal\\ 1997.\n\nNumerous attempts to elucidate the nature of the object named as 3EG\nJ1835+5918 and to find a definite astrophysical counterpart did not\nsucceed, see Mirabal \\etal\\ 2000; Reimer \\etal\\ 2001; Halpern \\etal\\\n2002; Fegan \\etal\\ 2005; Halpern \\etal\\ 2007, and references therein.\nAfter intensive studies of its error box in optical, X-ray, and radio\nwave bands it was identified as an isolated neutron star correlating with\na faint X-ray source RX J1836.2+5925, discovered by ROSAT. It was\nsuggested that the object is a Geminga-like pulsar, which is not observed\nin optical and radio wave bands, and an upper limit of the distance to\nthe object was obtained ($\\lesssim800$~pc). All attempts to find\npulsations in the X-ray and gamma-ray energy ranges failed. Pulsations of\n3EG J1835+5918 were not observed during the first year of observations by\nthe AGILE instrument either, though its gamma-ray emission was confirmed\nat $15.6\\sigma$ significance level (Bulgarelli \\etal\\ 2008; Pittori\n\\etal\\ 2009). Only gamma-ray observations by the Fermi LAT lead to\nunequivocal identification of 3EG J1835+5918 as a pulsar, named LAT PSR\nJ1836+5925.\n\nSince the search for gamma-ray sources had become a natural part of the\nsearch for PeV cosmic ray sources (Rowell \\etal\\ 2005), we performed a\nmore detailed analysis of the REF located in the direction to both\npulsars."

        "introduction": "The evolutionary stage of a powerful extragalactic radio source is\ncurrently thought to be related to its linear size.

The genuine youth of \nthese objects\nwas strongly supported by the determination of both the kinematic\n\\citep[e.g.][]{owsianik98,polatidis03,polatidis09,giroletti09,mo10}\nand radiative \n\\citep[e.g.][]{murgia99,murgia03,mo07} ages of a dozen of the most compact\nobjects (LS $\\leq$ 100 pc) which turned out to be about\n10$^{3}$--10$^{5}$ years. Given their young age and the intrinsically\nsmall size,\nCSS/GPS sources provide us\nwith a unique opportunity to study how the radio emission evolves and\nwhich role the ambient medium plays on their growth during the first\nstages of their evolution. A dense,\n  inhomogeneous environment may slow down the expansion of the radio\n  source in the case one jet interacts with a dense cloud. Although\n  the confinement may not last for the entire source lifetime, it may\n  cause an underestimate of the source age.\\\\\nThe radio morphology of CSS/GPS radio sources closely resembles\nthat of Fanaroff-Riley type-II radio galaxies \\citep{fr74},\nbut on much smaller scale. \nTheir radio  structure \nis usually termed {\\it symmetric} in the sense that the radio emission is\nfound on the two opposite sides of the core \n(when detected), giving rise to the classification of either compact\nsymmetric objects \\citep[CSOs,][]{wilkinson94}, if they are smaller\nthan 1 kpc, or medium-sized symmetric objects \\citep[MSO,][]{fanti95}\nif they extend on scales up to 15-20 kpc. However, a large fraction of\nCSS and GPS sources have a very asymmetric two-sided morphology\n\\citep[e.g.][]{saikia03} where\none of the lobes is much brighter and closer to the core than the\nother. This kind of asymmetry cannot be explained in terms of beaming\neffects and path delay, suggesting that the two jets are piercing\ntheir way through an inhomogeneous medium\n\\citep[e.g.][]{mo07,jeyakumar05}. A strong indication of asymmetries\nproduced by a jet-cloud interaction comes from the detection of\natomic hydrogen in absorption only against the brighter (and closer to core) \nlobe in the CSS objects 3C\\,49 and 3C\\,268.3\n\\citep{labiano06}, and in the restarted source 3C\\,236\n\\citep{conway99}. \nMoreover, evidence that the ionized gas may be\ninhomogeneously distributed around the radio source was provided by\nthe detection of asymmetric free-free absorption against the two lobes\nin three of the most compact radio galaxies (LS $<$ 16 pc): \nJ0428+3259, J1511+0518 \\citep{mo08}, and OQ\\,208\n\\citep{kameno00}. \nAll these indications suggest that in a substantial fraction\nof small objects the radio source is not uniformly enshrouded by a homogeneous\nenvironment and the two jets may experience different\nconditions during their propagation through the interstellar\nmedium. Although the gas is not dense enough to frustrate the jet\nexpansion for the entire source lifetime\n\\citep[e.g.][]{aneta05,fanti00,fanti95}, it may slow down the\nsource growth if a jet-cloud interaction takes place.

        "question": "What wavelength surveys have revealed the existence of dense clumps in star-forming clouds with masses extending into the brown-dwarf regime?",
        "introduction": "Recent millimeter-wavelength surveys of star-forming clouds have revealed the existence of many small dense clumps that have masses extending well down into the brown-dwarf regime, and that appear likely to be direct stellar progenitors (e.g., Motte et al 1998; Motte \\& Andr\\'e 2001a,b).  Part of the evidence that these small dense clumps or `cloud cores' may be direct stellar progenitors is the fact that their mass spectrum is similar to the stellar IMF at masses below a few solar masses (Luhman \\& Rieke 1999; Motte \\& Andr\\'e 2001a,b), suggesting that stars in this mass range may gain their masses directly from those of the cloud cores in which they form.  Other authors have found similar results, but with core masses that are systematically somewhat larger (Johnstone et al 2000, 2001); these results could still be consistent with the direct collapse of these cores into stars but with a somewhat lower efficiency of star formation.  If low-mass stars gain their masses from those of the prestellar cloud cores in which they form, the problem of understanding stellar masses then becomes, to a large extent, the problem of understanding cloud fragmentation processes, i.e. of understanding how the material in a star-forming cloud becomes divided up into individual star-forming units.\n\n   Perhaps even more direct evidence that low-mass stars owe their characteristic mass to cloud fragmentation processes is provided by the fact that stars typically form in small clusters of a few hundred stars in which the efficiency of star formation is moderately high, of the order of 25 to 30 percent (Lada \\& Lada 2003).  This means that the average stellar mass is determined to within a factor of 3 or 4 just by the number of stars that form in each cluster-forming region, since the average mass is equal to the total stellar mass divided by the number of stars, and this is equal within a factor of 3 or 4 to the total mass of the cluster-forming region divided by the number of stars formed in it.  The problem of understanding the preferred stellar mass is then basically one of understanding the number of star-forming cloud cores that form in such a region.  That is, the problem is one of understanding the typical scale of fragmentation -- does most of the mass go into a few large objects or many small ones?\n\n   The most classical type of fragmentation scale is the well-known Jeans scale based on balancing gravity against thermal pressure, which has been known for more than 100 years (Jeans 1902, 1929).  Although the original derivation by Jeans of a minimum length scale for fragmentation in an infinite uniform medium was not self-consistent, rigorous stability analyses have yielded dimensionally equivalent results for a variety of equilibrium configurations, including sheets, filaments, and spheres (Larson 1985, 2003b).  Many simulations of cloud collapse and fragmentation that include gravity and thermal pressure have also shown a clear imprint of the Jeans scale on the results: the number of star-forming cloud cores formed is always comparable to the number of Jeans masses present initially (e.g., Larson 1978; Monaghan \\& Lattanzio 1991; Klessen 2001; Bate, Bonnell, \\& Bromm 2003).  As long as gravity is strong enough to cause collapse to occur, the scale of fragmentation is not expected to be greatly altered by the presence of rotation or magnetic fields (Larson 1985, 2003b).  Simulations of turbulent fragmenting clouds have also shown that the amount of fragmentation that occurs is not strongly dependent on the way in which turbulence is introduced, or even on whether turbulence is initially present at all; the number of fragments formed always remains similar to the number of Jeans masses present initially, although fragment masses may be somewhat reduced by compression occurring during the collapse (Klessen 2001; Bonnell \\& Bate 2002; Bate et al 2003).  The effect of a magnetic field is less clear, but simulations of MHD turbulence typically show that that the nature of the turbulence is not qualitatively altered by the presence of a magnetic field; similar filamentary and clumpy structures are still seen (Mac Low \\& Klessen 2004).\n\n   Thus, while the relevance of the Jeans scale has not been established in all circumstances, many theoretical and numerical results have suggested that it has wide applicability.  Its relevance to star formation might not at first seem obvious, given that during the early stages of the process gravity is opposed mainly by magnetic fields and turbulence, while the Jeans criterion involves only gravity and thermal pressure (Mac Low \\& Klessen 2004).  However, the early evolution of star-forming clouds is expected to be characterized, to a considerable extent, by the loss of magnetic flux and the dissipation of turbulence in the densest contracting core regions, leaving thermal pressure eventually as the main force opposing gravity in the small dense prestellar cores that form.  Thus star formation in effect gets rid of most of the initial magnetic field and turbulence, as well as angular momentum, at a relatively early stage.  As would be expected on this basis, observed prestellar cores show a rough balance between gravity and thermal pressure, with a minor contribution from turbulence and a contribution from magnetic fields that may be comparable to thermal pressure but probably is not dominant.  The thermal physics must then play an important role in the later stages of the star formation process and in the processes that determine stellar masses and the IMF."

        "question": "What is the relationship between quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in black hole accretion disks and the formation of relativistic jets?",
        "introduction": "Luminosities and spectra emanating from the microquasars\nand AGNs are best explained by the gravitational energy released due to accretion onto compact objects\nsuch as black holes.\nHowever, it has been established in recent years, that black hole candidates,\nbe it stellar mass or super massive, emits powerful collimated\noutflows or jets \\citep{l99}. Since black holes do not have intrinsic atmosphere or hard surface,\nthese jets have to be generated from the accretion disc itself.\nIn a very interesting paper, \\citet{jetal99}\nhad shown that jets originate from around a region less\nthan $100r_g$ ($r_g{\\equiv}$ Schwarzschild radius) across the\ncentral object of the nearby active galaxy M87. Since the typical timescale\nof an AGN or a microquasar scales with mass, temporal behaviour of black hole\ncandidates is studied with microquasars \\citep{mkkf06}.  After investigating the connection\nbetween accretion and ejection in ten microquasars, \\citet{gfp03} \nconcluded that mildly relativistic, quasi steady jets are generally ejected in the low hard\nspectral states (\\ie when electromagnetic spectra peak in the high energy power-law frequency range)\nof the accretion disc. It was also shown that jets tend to get stronger\nas the microquasar moves to the intermediate hard states, and truly relativistic ejections\nare observed during hard-intermediate to soft-intermediate transition, after which the microquasar enters\ncanonical high soft state (\\ie when spectra peak in the thermal low energy range),\nwhich shows no jet activity \\citep{rsfp10,mil12}. All these evidences\nsuggest that the generation or quenching of jets do\ndepend on various states of the accretion disc, and that, \nthe jet formation mechanism is linked with the processes\nthat dominate at distances relatively closer to the black hole. \n\nIt is well known that, spectra from microquasar change states between, the low hard state (LH)\nand high soft state (HS), through a series of\nintermediate states. Interestingly, the hard power-law photons exhibit a quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO).\nThe QPOs evolve along with the spectral states of the accretion disc,\nstarting with low frequencies in LH, increasing\nas the luminosity increases, and reaches highest\nvalue before disappearing in the HS state \\citep{cdnp08,st09,ndmc12,nrs13}. \nInterestingly, \nalthough QPO frequency increases as the accretion disc moves\nfrom LH to intermediate states, but no QPO was detected during ejection of relativistic jets \\citep{nrs13,rn13} \nwhich suggests that, probably the part of the disc responsible for QPO is entirely ejected as relativistic jets.\nThis conversely also suggests that, the inner part of the disc is responsible for QPOs and is also the base of the\njet.\nAccretion disc models which are invoked to explain the accretion-ejection phenomena around black hole candidates,\nshould at least address the connection between spectral states, QPO evolution and the evolution of jets, apart from matching\nthe luminosities radiated by AGNs and microquasars.\n\nThere are various accretion disc models in the literature. We know that, matter\ncrosses the horizon with the speed of light ($c$) and circular orbits cannot exist within the marginally stable orbit\n($3r_g$).\nSo the inner boundary condition for accretion onto\nblack hole is necessarily transonic, as well as,\nsub-Keplerian, which implies that advection should be significant at least close to the horizon.\nThe very first model of accretion onto black holes was of course radial\ninflow of matter, which was basically the general relativistic version of the Bondi\nsolutions \\citep{b52,m72}. However, the infall time scale of radial accretion onto black holes is short,\nand therefore has very little time to produce the huge luminosities observed from AGNs and microquasars \\citep{s73}.\nOn the other hand,\n\\citet{ss73} considered a geometrically thin but optically thick accretion disc characterized by negligible advection,\nbut by virtue of possessing\nKeplerian angular momentum distribution, the disc was rotation dominated.\nThis disc model was radiatively efficient and produced the multi-coloured blackbody part of the spectra\nor the `blue bump' radiated by the AGNs. However, the presence of hard power-law tail in the spectra of the black hole\ncandidates indicated the necessity of a hot Comptonizing cloud, which was neither present in Keplerian disc\nnor its origin could be identified in any self-consistent manner from such a disc.\nTherefore, models with advection gained importance. Theoretically, it\nwas shown that in a significant\nrange of energy and angular momentum, multiple sonic points may exist for rotating,\ntransonic accretion flows onto black holes, where the existence of the inner sonic point\nis purely due to the presence of gravity stronger than that due to the Newtonian variety \\citep{lt80}.\nIt has been shown\nnumerically as well as analytically, that such transonic matter\nin the multiple sonic point regime, may undergo steady or\nnon-steady shock transition. Shock in accretion may be pressure\nand centrifugally supported, if the flow is rotating\n\\citep{f87,c90,mlc94,mrc96,msc96,cd04,mgt06,cd07,d07,dc08} or only be\npressure supported if the flow is spherical \\citep{co85,ke86,bom89}.\nThe most popular amongst accretion disc models with advection is the so-called\nadvection dominated accretion flow (ADAF), and it is characterized by a single sonic point\nclose to the horizon \\citep{nkh97}. It has been shown later,\nthat ADAF type solution is a subset of a general viscous advective\naccretion solutions \\citep{lgy99,bdl08,kc13}.\nThe shock in accretion disc around black holes has been shown to exist for \nmultispecies flows with\nvariable adiabatic index ($\\gamma$) as well \\citep{c08,cc11,kscc13,ck13}.\n\nShock transition for accretion flow are favourable mechanism to\nexplain many of the observational features of black hole candidates.\nHot electrons in the post-shock region, abbreviated as CENBOL\n(CENtrifugal pressure supported Boundary Layer),\nmay explain\nthe power-law tail of the spectrum from black hole candidates in\nhard states, while a weak or no shock solution produces a dearth of hot electrons which may cause\nthe weaker power-law tail in the soft states \\citep{ct95,mc10}. Moreover, a\nlarge number of authors have shown the formation of bipolar outflows from the\npost-shock accretion flow, both numerically \\citep{mlc94,msc96} as\nwell as analytically \\citep{lb05,cd07,fk07,dc08,dbl09,kc13,kscc13,kcm14}. It is also\ninteresting to note that, by considering a simplified inviscid accretion,\nand which has the right parameters to form a standing shock,\n\\citet{dcnc01} qualitatively showed that there would be no jets in no-shock or weak shock\ncondition of the disc, or in other words, when the disc is in the soft spectral state.\nThis indicates the conclusions of\n\\citet{gfp03}. Such a scheme of accretion-ejection solution is interesting because, the jet\nbase is not the entire accretion disc but the inner part of the disc, as has been\nsuggested by observations \\citep{jetal99,detal12}.\n\nAlthough, most of the efforts have been undertaken theoretically to\nstudy steady shocks, perhaps transient shock formations may explain\nthe transient events of the black hole candidates much better.\n\\citet{msc96}, considered bremsstrahlung cooling of an inviscid\nflow, and reported there is significant oscillation of the\npost-shock region. Since the post-shock flow is of higher density\nand temperature compared to the pre-shock flow, the cooling rates\nare higher. If the cooling timescale roughly matches with the\ninfall timescale at the shock the resonance condition occurs and\nthe post-shock flow oscillates. Since the post-shock region is\nthe source of hard X-rays \\citep{ct95}, thus its oscillation\nwould be reflected in the oscillation of the emitted hard\nX-rays --- a plausible explanation for QPOs \\citep{cm00}.\nIn this paper, we will focus on the\noscillation of the shock front, but now due to viscosity instead\nof any cooling mechanism. \\citet{cd04,kc13} had shown that, with the\nincrease of viscosity parameter, in the energy-angular momentum parameter\nspace, the domain of shock decreases.  \nWe know viscosity transports angular momentum outwards, while the\nspecific energy increases inwards. How does the general flow\nproperties of matter, which are being launched with same injection\nspeed and temperature, be affected with the increase in viscosity\nparameter? It has been shown from simulations and theoretical studies\nthat post-shock matter is ejected as jets, however if the shock is weak\nthen the jet should be of lower power! We would like to find the condition of the shocked disc\nthat produces weak or strong jets. Disc instability due to viscous transport\nhas been shown before and has been identified with QPOs \\citep{lmc98,lcscbz08,lrc11},\nhowever, we would like\nto show how this instability might affect the shock induced bipolar outflows.\nMoreover, it has been shown theoretically that the energy and angular momentum for which\nsteady shock exists in inviscid flow, will become unstable for viscous flow \\citep{cd04,kc13}.\nWe would like to see how the mass outflow rate depend on unstable shock,\nor in other words, if there is any connection between QPOs and mass outflow rate.\nIn this paper, we would like to address these issues.\n\nIn the next section, we present the governing equations and model\nassumptions.

        "question": "What is the relationship between the abundance of primordial black holes and the amplitude of the primordial power spectrum during an early matter-dominated phase of the universe?",
        "introduction": "Primordial black holes (PBHs) can form from the collapse of large density fluctuations in the early Universe. If an overdensity of order unity in a given region reenters the Hubble sphere\\footnote{`Hubble sphere' is used interchangeably with `horizon' throughout.} after inflation, then the region collapses to form a PBH with mass roughly equal to the mass within the Hubble sphere. \n\nThe abundance of PBHs in our observable Universe today can constrain the primordial power spectrum, and hence models of inflation, on scales much smaller than are accessible via observations of the CMB and LSS (which provide the tightest constraints on the primordial power spectrum for scales between $k\\sim10^{-3}-1\\,{\\rm Mpc^{-1}}$). Constraints on the abundance of PBHs are very tight at the time of their formation, due to their gravitational effects and the consequences of their evaporation if they were sufficiently light \\cite{Carr:2009jm}. See \\cite{Niikura:2017zjd} for some of the most up to date constraints on the abundance of PBHs\\footnote{Presented in the context of whether PBHs can make up all of dark matter.}.  Despite constraints on PBHs being tight, the fact that PBH abundance and the power spectrum are related logarithmically during radiation domination %\nmeans that even massively tightening the PBH abundance constraints does not translate into a great improvement on the constraints on the primordial power spectrum. Here we derive the tightest constraints possible on the primordial power spectrum given the most extreme constraints on the abundance of PBHs, i.e.~that there are none.  \n\nApart from providing the tightest possible future constraints on the primordial power spectrum\\footnote{Assuming radiation domination and Gaussian initial perturbations.}, this extreme assumption is motivated by an argument that the decay of a PBH would destabilise the Higgs vacuum; hence PBHs of masses small enough that they would have decayed by today can't ever have formed \\cite{Burda:2015isa,Burda:2016mou,Tetradis:2016vqb}. If they had they would have seeded the decay of the metastable Higgs vacuum, the Universe would have tunnelled to the true vacuum, and hence been destroyed. See \\cite{Gorbunov:2017fhq,Canko:2017ebb} for limitations of this claim.\n\nSince the logarithmic relation between PBH abundance and the power spectrum is the main cause of the suppression of the constraint, the most effective way of improving the constraint is by looking at  scenarios where the power spectrum amplitude is more sensitive to the PBH abundance. \nThis is the case during an early matter dominated phase (see \\cite{Kane:2015jia} and \\cite{Acharya:2009zt} for motivations) where the relation between abundance and power spectrum is instead given by a power law \\cite{Polnarev1981,Harada:2016mhb}. This means that for an observed abundance of a particular PBH mass, the constraint on the primordial power spectrum is tightened by many orders of magnitude, suggesting that the best constraint possible will come from such a scenario where the equation of state is at its minimum non-negative value, $\\omega=0$. Models with $-\\frac{1}{3}<\\omega<0$ are rarely considered, and $\\omega<-1/3$ corresponds to inflation. In terms of the worst constraints, according to \\cite{Harada:2013epa}, the value of $\\omega$ for which it is most difficult to produce PBHs is $\\omega=1/3$ due to the value of critical overdensity being at its maximum. The threshold density then decreases as $\\omega$ approaches 1. However, this is different to the results of \\cite{Musco:2012au} whose value of critical overdensity increases with $\\omega$ for $0<\\omega<0.6$ (other values of $\\omega$ were not simulated) suggesting that the larger $\\omega$ is, the more difficult it is to produce PBHs. \n\nGenerally, calculations done in the radiation-dominated scenario assume spherical symmetry of the collapsing region (which makes collapse as likely as possible) but those done in the matter-dominated scenario do not \\cite{Kuhnel:2016exn}. Full numerical simulations of the collapse of density fluctuations to form PBHs are required to gain a complete understanding of the process. The critical density required for a region to collapse and form a PBH also depends on the density profile. Additionally, phenonema such as non-Gaussianity could have  a significant influence on the abundance of PBHs since they are formed from rare, large overdensities. Such large fluctuations are susceptible to changes in the tail of the fluctuation distribution caused by the amount of non-Gaussianity present \\cite{Young:2013oia}. \n We will not show explicitly the effects of non-Gaussianity on our results but its potential effect should be kept in mind. Furthermore for simplicity, we will assume that all PBHs form with the same mass for a given time. In reality, PBH masses depend on the PBH mass function (see \\cite{Carr:2017jsz}  for a recent update) which would affect the scale at which primordial power spectrum constraints are correlated to. \n\nThe paper is laid out as follows: in section \\ref{Ian Moss} we will discuss the argument in \\cite{Burda:2015isa,Burda:2016mou} for zero PBHs due to the Higgs instability and calculate constraints on the primordial power spectrum in this case. In section \\ref{Matter} we will look at motivations for a matter dominated phase and find constraints on the primordial power spectrum for different durations of matter domination prior to BBN. Finally, in section \\ref{section:mossmatter} we will combine these two frameworks and see the result of their co-existence which is shown to be in agreement with the results of \\cite{Gorbunov:2017fhq}."

        "question": "What is the primary method used to distinguish supernova remnants from H II regions in radio surveys of extragalactic sources?",
        "introduction": "Supernova remnants (SNRs) are a critical channel through which massive stars feed back on their host galaxies. They provide the kinetic energy for galactic fountains and winds and the heat for the warm interstellar medium (ISM), pollute the ISM with metals, and accelerate cosmic rays. Individual objects have been studied in depth in the Milky Way, but very little is known about SNRs as populations. Surveys of SNRs outside our Galaxy provide an opportunity to understand SNRs in a more systematic way, as SNRs in extragalactic systems are not subject to the high levels of extinction and distance ambiguities present in the Milky Way. \n\nOther discrete sources like planetary nebulae (e.g., Jacoby 1989, Jacoby \\etal 1990), X-ray binaries (Fabbiano 2006), and globular clusters (Brodie \\& Strader 2006) can be observed in nearby galaxies and are currently being understood as populations, leading to many advances in fields ranging from the distance ladder to galaxy evolution and cosmology. Our hope is to develop a similar understanding of SNRs, in order to statistically probe the interstellar medium and feedback from massive stars in galaxies with a wide range of masses and Hubble types. \n\nSurveys for extragalactic SNRs have been carried out for several decades in the radio, optical, X-ray, and infrared (IR). Optical searches generally utilize narrow-band imaging of the [S~II] and H$\\alpha$ emission lines, with the expectation that shock-excited SNRs will have elevated [S~II]/H$\\alpha$ as compared with photo-ionized H~II regions. This method was pioneered by Mathewson \\& Clarke (1973) for use on the Magellanic Clouds, but has since been applied to many nearby galaxies with great success (typical detection rates of 5-100 SNRs per galaxy; e.g., Matonick \\& Fesen 1997). Labrie \\& Pritchet (2006) recently developed a similar technique using the [Fe~II] and Pa$\\beta$ emission lines in the near-infrared (NIR), which should be less vulnerable to dust obscuration than the optical lines. They detect SNRs in three starbursting irregular galaxies, including one which is the subject of this study, NGC 1569. In the X-ray, SNRs can be more difficult to separate from other discrete sources, but several studies have identified SNR candidates based on their soft spectra and lack of time variability (e.g., Pannuti \\etal 2000, Pannuti \\etal 2002). Martin \\etal (2002) surveyed one of our sample galaxies, NGC 1569, in the X-ray and identified an X-ray source as a potential SNR. Finally, nearby galaxies have been surveyed in the radio for SNRs, usually using 20 cm and 6 cm images to constrain discrete sources' spectral indices and separate non-thermal SNRs from H~II regions. Some of the most successful searches of this kind have been in M33 (Gordon \\etal 1999) and NGC 6946 (Lacey \\etal 1997, Lacey \\& Duric 2001). Some of the SNRs in two of the galaxies presented here have been previously studied in the radio (Greve \\etal 2002 in NGC 1569 and Vukoti\\'{c} \\etal 2005 in NGC 4214; see Section 2). In most cases, the different wavelength techniques detect distinct kinds of SNRs (see Pannuti \\etal 2002 and Duric 2000), and galaxies should be surveyed at as many wavelengths as possible in order to achieve a complete census of SNRs.\n \nOur goal is to study the radio luminosity function of SNRs, and therefore in this study, we focus on SNRs selected by their 20 cm emission. We present a catalog of the discrete radio sources in four irregular galaxies-- NGC 1569, NGC 2366, NGC 4214, and NGC 4449. Radio-bright SNRs typically have diameters of $\\sim$10-100 pc (Gordon \\etal 1999), corresponding to 0.7-7$^{\\prime\\prime}$ at a distance of 3 Mpc. Therefore, for nearby galaxies, they will appear as discrete (point-like or slightly resolved) sources when observed with most ground-based observatories. The radio continuum of star-forming galaxies is composed of three components: thermal free-free emission arising from H~II regions, synchrotron emission from supernova remnants (SNRs), and diffuse non-thermal emission. The high-resolution observations we present here mostly resolve out the latter diffuse component, but it remains an important task to separate H~II regions from SNRs. \n\nThis work makes progress on our understanding of four irregular galaxies by bringing together data from the VLA taken over the past 25 years and achieving sensitivites of $\\sim$20 $\\mu$Jy. We select discrete sources based on their 20 cm emission and measure their radio spectra using 20 cm, 6 cm, and 3.6 cm flux densities. We characterize them as SNRs, H~II regions, or background galaxies, and then discuss some individual sources of note and compare our sample with sources in the literature. Finally, we consider future applications for samples like this one. This study seeks to increase the number of known radio SNRs, with the hope that we can ultimately extract the statistical properties of SNR populations in galaxies."

        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\nThe newly launched Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\\emph{Insight}-HXMT) is China's first X-ray astronomical satellite.\n\\emph{Insight}-HXMT carries three main payloads onboard: the High Energy telescope (HE), the Medium Energy telescope (ME) and the Low Energy telescope (LE) \\citep{zhang2014}.\nOne of its primary scientific objectives is scanning the Galactic plane to monitor time-varying objects and to discover X-ray transients \\citep{zhang2014}.\n\\emph{Insight}-HXMT is based on the direct demodulation (DD) method because all telescopes onboard are position-insensitive collimated detectors and images can only be reconstructed from the observed data by offline data analysis \\citep{li1993dd,li1994dd,li2007,zhang2009}.\n\nIn the analysis of astronomical data, observed data can be modelled as object functions modulated by kernel functions, which characterise the observation process, mainly the instrument response.\nFor example, an observed image is a spatial distribution of objects modulated by an imaging system, where a point spread function (PSF) serves as the modulation\nkernel function.\nObserved spectra are object spectra modulated by energy response matrices.\nThe relations among the observed data, the object, and the observation process can be formulated with a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind:\n\\begin{equation}\n  d\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) = \\int h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) f\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}\\right) \\mathrm{d} \\boldsymbol{x}\\text{,}\n  \\label{equ:fredholm}\n\\end{equation}\nwhere $d\\left(\\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)$, $h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)$ and $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}\\right)$ represent models of the observed data, the kernel, and the object, respectively, and $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ and $\\boldsymbol{x}$ are coordinate variables for the observed data domain (e.g. pixel indices, energy channels, possible state parameters of instruments and so on) and the object domain (e.g. WCS celestial sphere coordinates), respectively.\nThe object model $f\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}\\right)$ represents both the sources and the sky background.\nThe kernel $h\\left(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)$ characterises the observation process including the instrument response as well as non-sky backgrounds; for example, dark currents, or cosmic rays for high-energy detectors. In order to solve the equation, both periodic calibration of instrument response and non-sky background estimation are necessary to estimate the kernel.\nDifferences between the true kernel and its estimation lead to systematic errors in the solution, that is, the estimated object.\nDiscussions of instrument response calibration, non-sky background modelling and estimation, and systematic error due to above issues are beyond the scope of this work.\n\nThe DD method is introduced by \\citet{li1993dd} to solve the modulation equation and then to reconstruct the unknown object from the observed data.\nIn Eq. \\ref{equ:fredholm} a model of the observed data instead of the data itself is given.\nSince the data itself is a random outcome of the observation process, statistical solution of the modulation equation is achieved via the DD method according to the probability distribution of the observed data implied by its model.\nFor observed data dominated by Poisson fluctuation, the simplest implementation of the DD method degenerates into Richardson-Lucy (RL) iteration \\citep{richardson1972,lucy1974}.\nAs a non-parametric approach, reconstruction through RL iteration allows a larger pool of solutions that fit the observed data, compared with parametric\nfitting approaches that require explicit and known models of both signals and backgrounds \\citep{puetter2005}.\nHowever, a larger pool of solutions often results in an ill-posed problem, which is unstable or divergent.\nThe DD method overcomes this problem by continuously cross-correlating both sides of Eq. \\ref{equ:fredholm} and transforming the original modulation equation into its $L$-fold equivalents to improve its positive definitiveness, as well as non-linear physical constraints used to regularize the iteration, thereby shrinking the pool of solutions so that the object reconstruction problem is reduced.\n\nIn real-world data analysis, it is often necessary to avoid data with a poor signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) through screening and selection; for example, the \\emph{Good Time Interval} (GTI) auxiliary record \\citep{blackburn1995ftools} is used to select time series data in \\emph{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} (RXTE) as well as \\emph{Insight}-HXMT data analysis, or, to include relevant data from other instruments or epochs in order to provide better statistics.\nMeanwhile, the dimensionality and irregularity of the corresponding modulation equation increases, which imposes growing complexity on the reconstruction, especially for \\emph{Insight}-HXMT data analysis, where the modulation kernels lack circular symmetry.\nThe computational complexity introduced by rotation modulation is reduced by an angular clustering method specifically designed for \\emph{Insight}-HXMT all-sky survey \\citep{huo2013raa}, since the rotation modulation can be represented much more sparsely with explicit angular coordinates.\n\nAlthough the DD method treats the ill-posed object reconstruction problem, the lack of a modulation-kernel-constructing process or accelerated implementation for general cases prevents this method from being applied to data analysis tasks with high dimensionality or large datasets.\nIn this article we provide the synthetic direct demodulation method (synDD), which features\n  \\begin{enumerate}\n    \\item a modulation-kernel-constructing process to combine kernels characterizing individual instruments, observations and/or data screening/selection into one synthetic kernel (modulation equation synthesis process), and\n    \\item an accelerated implementation for general cases by decomposing an arbitrary kernel matrix into a weighted sum of a series of circulant matrices so that the fast Fourier transform (FFT) can help (modulation kernel matrix analysis process).\n  \\end{enumerate}\nConsequently, we can not only deal with the previously mentioned rotation modulation without losing important information sampled from different position angles, as well as the projection distortion that occurs on the tangential plane of the celestial sphere, which we put aside in previous work \\citep{huo2013raa}, but can also squeeze a more complicated kernel (e.g. with screening or weighing matrices) and additional observed data into our representation of the modulation equation."

        "introduction": "The giant molecular cloud Sgr B2 is located in the Galactic center ($\\sim$44$^{\\prime}$ from SgrA*). High resolution radio continuum and recombination line observations at centimeter wavelenghts showed  the two most active star forming cores, Sgr B2(N) and (M), hosting clusters of massive stars associated with UCHII regions [1-6]. Previous observations showed that massive star formation is taking place in both Sgr B2(N) and (M), suggesting that the two hot cores are at different evolutionary stages [7-12]. H$_{2}$CO molecule has a simple chemical formation path and has been proven to be a useful probe of physical conditions of star formation regions [13,14]. We observed Sgr B2 at 1.3 mm with the SMA including the lines of H$_{2}$CO. The new results regarding the ongoing star formation in the Galactic center region are reported in this paper."

        "question": "What is the physical significance of polarity inversion lines (PILs) in solar magnetograms?",
        "introduction": "\\label{sec:intro}\n\nSolar variability is intimately related to magnetic flux at the solar\nphotosphere: solar flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs), and enhanced\nradiation from solar activity, ranging from radio to X-ray\nwavelengths, all occur in the outer solar atmosphere above magnetized\nregions of the photosphere.  Fundamentally, these manifestations of\nsolar activity are driven by the release of energy stored in or\ntransmitted by magnetic fields.\n\n\\subsection{Doppler Shifts \\& the Poynting Flux}\n\\label{subsec:poynting}\n\nMagnetic energy passes from the solar interior into the Sun's outer\natmosphere as an outward-directed Poynting flux $\\Svec$ of magnetic\nenergy across the photosphere,\n\\be S_n = \\hatn \\cdot \\Svec = c \\hatn \\cdot (\\evec \\times \\bvec)/4 \\pi \n\\label{eqn:poynting0} ~, \\ee \nwhere $c$ is the speed of light, $\\evec$ and $\\bvec$ are the\nphotospheric electric and magnetic fields, and $\\hatn$ is the\noutward-directed unit vector normal to the photosphere.  We will refer\nto vectors perpendicular to the local normal as horizontal.  We use\nthe photosphere as the boundary between the solar interior and outer\natmosphere primarily for convenience, because the vector magnetic\nfield is only routinely measured at the photosphere.  A different\natmospheric layer could be used if observations of the vector magnetic\nfield were routinely produced there (see, e.g.,\n\\citealt{Metcalf1995}).\n\nWhile $\\bvec$ at the photosphere can be measured by vector\nmagnetographs, $\\evec$ must be inferred by other means.  A popular\napproach has been to use observed magnetic evolution in sequences of\nmagnetograms to estimate the electric field by inverting the\nfinite-difference approximation to Faraday's law,\n\\be \\frac{\\Delta \\bvec}{\\Delta t} = -c (\\nabla \\times \\evec)\n\\label{eqn:faraday} ~, \\ee \nwhere $\\Delta t$ is the difference between the times $t_f$ and $t_i$\nof final and initial magnetograms, respectively, with $\\evec$\nrepresenting an average electric field over $\\Delta t$.  Note that for\nany $\\evec$ which satisfies this expression, $(\\evec - \\nabla \\psi)$,\nwhere $\\psi$ is an arbitrary scalar potential function, will also\nsatisfy it.  Hence, Faraday's law does not fully constrain $\\evec$.\n\nWe assume the magnetic field is typically frozen to the plasma at the\nphotosphere on length scales observable with HMI, which has a pixel\nsize $\\Delta x \\simeq 0.5 \\arcsec$, or $\\simeq 360$ km near disk\ncenter.  \\citet{Kubat1986} estimated the magnetic diffusivity\n$\\eta_{\\rm Ku}$ from collisions at the photosphere to be $10^8$ cm$^2$\ns$^{-1}$ in magnetized regions with $B = 100$ G, implying the fluid\ncould slip across the magnetic field with relative velocity $u \\sim\n\\eta_{\\rm Ku}/\\Delta x \\simeq 3$ cm s$^{-1}$, which is completely\nnegligible compared to typical photospheric speeds.  Ignoring\ndiffusivity, the ideal Ohm's law relates photospheric velocities,\n$\\vvec$, to the electric field,\n\\be c \\evec = -\\vvec \\times \\bvec\n\\label{eqn:ideal} ~. \\ee \nThis implies estimates of $\\vvec$ can be used to determine the flux of\nmagnetic energy (and magnetic helicity) across the photosphere (e.g.,\n\\citealt{Demoulin2003, Schuck2006}).  Several techniques have been\ndeveloped to estimate photospheric flows from $\\Delta B_n/\\Delta t$,\ne.g., \\citet{Chae2001, Kusano2002, Welsch2004, Schuck2006, Fisher2008} and\n\\citet{Schuck2008}.  These techniques are, however, imperfect\n\\citep{Rieutord2001, Welsch2007, Schuck2008}, so efforts to improve\nthem are ongoing.\n\n\\citet{Fisher2010} presented a method to determine $\\evec$ from a\nsequence of vector magnetograms using a poloidal-toroidal\ndecomposition (PTD) of the magnetic field, with Faraday's law.\nNotably, the PTD method uses evolution of both the normal magnetic\nfield, $\\Delta B_n/\\Delta t$, and the normal electric current, $\\Delta\nJ_n/\\Delta t$, to estimate $\\evec$.  While the PTD approach does not\nrely upon the ideal Ohm's law to estimate $\\evec$, any Ohm's law with\nknown resistive terms, including the ideal case, can be imposed {\\em\n  post facto} to constrain the solution for $\\evec$.\n\nFor the ideal case, \\citet{Fisher2012b} recently presented a method to\nuse Doppler measurements of the line-of-sight (LOS) component of the\nvelocity, $v_{LOS}$, to better constrain $\\evec$.  They tested this\napproach using synthetic magnetograms and Doppler data from an MHD\nsimulation.  They noted that flows along $\\bvec$ (commonly referred to\nas parallel or siphon flows) do not contribute to the ideal electric\nfield in equation (\\ref{eqn:ideal}), but can contribute to $v_{LOS}$\nin regions where the LOS component of the magnetic field is nonzero\n($B_{LOS} \\ne 0$).  Hence, they only incorporated Doppler data from\nareas: (i) near polarity inversion lines (PILs), loci where the\ncomponent of the magnetic field along their (assumed) LOS changes sign\nand the LOS field vanishes; and (ii) where the field transverse to the\nLOS is large.  Their tests demonstrated that including Doppler data\nnear PILs substantially improves estimation of both $\\evec$ and the\nnormal Poynting flux $S_n$.  For ideal evolution, this makes sense\nbecause, in principle, the Doppler electric field $\\evec^D$ from the\nLOS velocity $v_{\\rm LOS}$ and transverse magnetic field $\\bvec_{\\rm\n  trs}$ along a PIL,\n\\be c \\evec^D \\equiv -(v_{\\rm LOS} \\times \\bvec_{\\rm trs} ) \\vert_{\\rm PIL} ~, \\ee\nis not uncertain by the gradient of a scalar potential, as are\nestimates of $\\evec$ from equation (\\ref{eqn:faraday}) alone.\n\nIn real magnetograms, procedures have been developed to automatically\nidentify PILs (also sometimes called neutral lines; e.g.,\n\\citealt{Falconer2003}) of both the LOS components (e.g.,\n\\citealt{Schrijver2007, Welsch2008b, Welsch2009}) and normal\ncomponents \\citep{Falconer2003} of magnetogram fields.\n\nOne factor hampering studies of Poynting fluxes has been the relative\ndearth of sequences of vector magnetograms.  The launch of the\nSpectroPolarimeter (SP) instrument with the Solar Optical Telescope\n(SOT; \\citealt{Tsuneta2008}) aboard the {\\em Hinode} satellite\n\\citep{Kosugi2007} provided some seeing-free magnetogram sequences for\ninvestigations of PIL dynamics, such as observations suggestive of an\nemerging flux rope reported by \\citet{Okamoto2008}.  However, the\ncadence of the SP instrument is relatively slow compared to timescales\nof photospheric evolution on arcsecond scales, and the field of view\n(FOV) of SOT is limited. Vector magnetograms of active region fields\nat higher cadence and over larger FOVs should be routinely produced by\nthe Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument\n\\citep{Scherrer2012} aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and\nthe SOLIS vector spectromagnetograph (VSM; \\citealt{Keller2003}),\nenabling routine estimates of Poynting flux.\n\n\\subsection{Emergence \\& Cancellation Along PILs}\n\\label{subsec:cancel}\n\nGiven the association between solar activity and magnetic fields, a\nquantitative description of processes responsible for the introduction\nand removal of magnetic flux into the solar atmosphere is essential to\nunderstand solar activity.\n\nNew magnetic flux typically appears at the solar photosphere via\nemergence of $\\Omega$-shaped loops from the convection zone (Figure\n\\ref{fig:all5}, top row, left panel).  About 3000 active regions are\ntypically cataloged by NOAA (which requires each to contain a visible\nsunspot umbra) over one 11-year cycle of solar activity, each with\n$\\sim 10^{22}$ Mx ($10^{14}$ Wb) in unsigned flux.  Estimates vary for\nthe time required for emergence to replace the small-scale magnetic\nfields in the quiet-Sun network, with unsigned flux on the order of\n$\\sim 10^{23}$ Mx over the photospheric surface, but they are\ngenerally on the order of a day or less (e.g., Hagenaar et al. 2003).\n\\nocite{Hagenaar2003} We note that new flux can also appear in\nphotospheric magnetograms via the submergence of the bases of U-shaped\nloops from above, as seen in simulations by \\citet{Abbett2007} (Figure\n\\ref{fig:all5}, top row, right panel), though this process is not\noften discussed.  Hence, the term {\\em appearance} encompasses both\nemergence and submergence.  This definition of the term differs\nsubstantially from that used by \\citet{Lamb2008}, in which appearance\nrefers to initial identification of a {\\em feature} by a tracking\nalgorithm, where the definition of ``feature'' is algorithm-dependent.\n\nMuch like the appearance of new flux, the removal of magnetic flux\nfrom the photosphere also plays a central role in solar activity.\nClearly, for the large-scale solar dynamo to operate cyclically, flux\nthat is introduced to the photosphere must eventually be removed or\nrecycled.  Similarly, flux emergence in the small-scale dynamo must be\nstatistically balanced by flux removal \\citep{Schrijver1997}.\n\nHow is flux removed from the photosphere?  The short answer is ``flux\ncancellation,'' which \\citet{Livi1985} defined in observational terms\nas ``the mutual apparent loss of magnetic flux in closely spaced\nfeatures of opposite polarity'' in magnetogram sequences.  Physically,\ncancellation could correspond to (i) the emergence of U-shaped\nmagnetic loops (e.g., \\citealt{Lites1995, vanDriel-Gesztelyi2000}),\n(ii) the submergence of $\\Omega$-shaped loops (e.g.,\n\\citealt{Rabin1984b, Harvey1999, Chae2004, Iida2010}), or (iii)\nreconnection in the magnetogram layer (e.g., \\citealt{Yurchyshyn2001,\n  Kubo2007}; see also \\citealt{Welsch2006}).

In\n    principle, processes that increase or decrease total unsigned flux\n    only occur along PILs.}}\n\\label{fig:all5}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\\citet{Spruit1987} proposed that opposite polarities within active\nregions could be connected by U-loop subsurface extensions, and that\nflux in these extensions might emerge as weak, ``sea-serpent''\n(undulating) fields between strong field regions, eventually canceling\nwith active region flux via U-loop emergence.  \\citet{Low2001}\nproposed a process that also removes most active region flux from the\nphotosphere by the emergence of U-loops.  He suggests that the flux\nrope that forms an active region contains many turns, such that a\nmagnetogram can intersect the flux rope many times after the flux rope\nhas partially emerged, and as the flux rope continues to emerge, much\nof the flux cancels by U-loop emergence, with successive magnetograms\nshowing less and less flux remaining until little is left.  In\ncontrast to these models, \\citet{vanBallegooijen2007} and\n\\citet{vanBallegooijen2008} constructed numerical models of active\nregion flux systems remaining anchored near the base of the convection\nzone, with most canceling flux retracting to ``repair'' the toroidal\nmagnetic field deep in the solar interior.\n\n\\citet{Spruit1987} noted that sea-serpent cancellation might occur on\nsmall scales. On unobservably small scales, this would produce\napparent {\\it in situ} flux disappearance \\citep{Wallenhorst1982a,\n  Wallenhorst1982b, Gaizauskas1983}.  Further, unlike the\n``self-cancellation'' of active region flux modeled by\n\\citet{Spruit1987}, \\citet{Low2001}, and \\citet{vanBallegooijen2007},\nactive region fields might also cancel with the ubiquitous,\nsmall-scale fields of the quiet sun (e.g., Lin \\& Rimmele 1999, Harvey\net al. 2007), \\nocite{Lin1999, Harvey2007} including unresolved fields\n\\citep{SanchezAlmeida2009}.  This process would formally remove equal\namounts of active-region and quiet-Sun flux from the photosphere, but\nif the latter were below a given magnetograph's noise threshold, it\nwould be undetectable, and the active-region flux would have seemed to\ndisappear.  While case studies of cancellation have been made, it is\nunclear how much active region flux cancels on observable scales over\na solar cycle.  Hence, it is possible that cancellation with quiet-Sun\nflux is the dominant method of active region flux removal.  Moving\nmagnetic features in moat flows around sunspots can explain rates of\nsunspot flux loss (e.g., \\citealt{Kubo2008}), but much flux in active\nregions lies outside sunspots, and its disappearance must still be\nunderstood.\n\n\n\nBecause magnetic fields are divergence-free, all field lines (tangent\nlines of the vector field $\\bvec$) form closed loops.  (These might be\ninfinitely long, or ergodic, but in any case field lines do not end.)\nMagnetic flux can therefore only emerge or cancel where magnetic\nfields are tangent to the photosphere.  These loci correspond to\nnormal-field PILs, where the normal magnetic field vanishes and\nregions of positive and negative flux, where emerging (or submerging)\nfield lines thread the photosphere, are nearby.  In our terminology,\nthe appearance (or cancellation) of magnetic flux increases (resp.,\ndecreases) the total unsigned magnetic flux at the photosphere.\n\nIf the photospheric electric field during cancellation is ideal or\nnearly so, then measurements of time-averaged Doppler shifts along\nPILs should be able to distinguish between cancellation via either\nU-loop emergence or $\\Omega$-loop submergence.  Lack of a clear\nDoppler signal while LOS flux cancels would be consistent with\nreconnective cancellation.  We note that the magnetic field along PILs\naway from disk center in LOS magnetograms can have a component that is\nnormal to the photosphere, implying LOS PILs away from disk center do\nnot exactly correspond to sites of flux appearance (or cancellation).\nHence, only Doppler shifts along LOS PILs near disk center can\neffectively constrain the physical processes at work in cancellation.\n\nSeveral case studies of Doppler shifts at cancellation sites have been\nundertaken.  \\citet{Yurchyshyn2001} and \\citet{BellotRubio2005}\nreported Doppler shifts consistent with upflows at the cancellation\nsites they studied, which they interpreted as outflows from\nreconnective cancellation.\n\\citet{Chae2004} and \\citet{Iida2010} found evidence for flux\nsubmergence during cancellation.  \\citet{Kubo2007} studied\ncancellations along several PILs in ASP magnetograms, and reported\nmixed Doppler signals, which they interpreted in terms of reconnective\ncancellation at multiple heights.  To determine the rest wavelengths\nused to compute Doppler velocities, \\citet{Chae2004} used quiet-Sun\nvalues of line center, while \\citet{Kubo2007} and \\citet{Iida2010}\nestimated their rest wavelengths by averaging line centers over their\nFOVs.  As described below, however, these approaches to\ndetermining rest wavelengths probably yield biased estimates.\n\n\\subsection{Biases in Doppler Shifts Along PILs}\n\\label{subsec:convective}\n\n\nOne factor complicating use of Doppler data both to estimate\nphotospheric electric fields and to constrain dynamics in flux\ncancellation is inaccuracies in determination of the rest wavelengths\nof photospheric lines in active regions.  Uncertainties in rest\nwavelength can arise from both instrumental effects (e.g., from thermal\nvariations in components) and biases in analysis techniques.\nIn addition, the gravitational redshift is present \\citep{Takeda2012}.\nPeriodicities in magnetic fields estimated by HMI \\cite{Liu2012b}\non orbital time scales (12 and 24 hr) suggest\ninstrumental effects are present in estimated magnetic fields.  It is\nplausible that similar effects should be present in\nDoppler signals, a point we revisit below.\n\nBecause the position of line center is typically computed from\nsampling predominantly quiet-Sun regions, where line profiles are\nsystematically shifted blue-ward by the convective blueshift\n\\citep{Dravins1981, Cavallini1986, Hathaway1992, Asplund2003,\n  Schuck2010}, Doppler shifts in active regions typically exhibit\n``pseudo-redshifts.''  The blue-ward bias of quiet-Sun line profiles\noccurs because rising plasma is both (i) brighter than sinking plasma\n(since rising plasma is hotter) and (ii) occupies a greater fraction\nof an instrument's FOV than sinking plasma (since upwelling\nconvective cells are larger than downflow lanes).  Consequently, a\ndetermination of line center position based upon the statistical\nproperties (e.g., means or medians) of Doppler images (Dopplergrams)\nis biased by the upward motion of quiet-Sun plasma.  Observations and\nmodeling, by, e.g., \\citet{Gray2009} and \\citet{Asplund2003},\nrespectively, suggest that the magnitude of this bias can range from a\nfew hundred m sec$^{-1}$ to nearly 1 km sec$^{-1}$ for various\nphotospheric lines.  Because active region magnetic fields inhibit\nconvection (e.g., \\citealt{Welsch2012}), measured line centers in\nactive regions are red-shifted relative to any rest wavelength derived\nfrom quiet-Sun Doppler measurements. (Helioseismology requires\naccurate measurement of {\\em changes} in Doppler shifts, so is\ninsensitive to errors in determination of the rest wavelength.)\nP. Scherrer (private communication 2009) has stated that one must\naccount for the convective blueshift to accurately determine Doppler\nshifts in active regions.\n\nBy fitting measured Doppler shifts over the disk with profiles that\naccount for differential rotation, meridional flow, and center-to-limb\nvariations, any overall constant Doppler shift (sometimes referred to\nas the convective limb shift; \\citealt{Hathaway1992}) can be estimated\n\\citep{Snodgrass1984, Hathaway1992, Schuck2010}.  This approach,\nhowever, has a major physical uncertainty: the physics of the\ncenter-to-limb variation in average Doppler shift in the particular\nspectral line used by HMI (or any other spectral line) involves\ndetailed interactions between height of formation, the height of\nconvective turnover, the variation with viewing angle of the average\nconvective flow speed, and the variation with viewing angle of optical\ndepth \\citep{Carlsson2004, Takeda2012}.  We note that diverging flows tangent to\nthe photosphere in granules can, depending upon optical depth in\ngranules at the formation height of the line, produce a convective\nblueshift toward the limb, because diverging flows on the near sides\nof granules approach the viewer, while receding flows on the far sides\nof the granules are at least partially obscured by the optical depth\nof the granules.  This is sketched in Figure \\ref{fig:c2l}.  Hence,\nfitting the observed center-to-limb variation in line-center positions\ndoes not imply that all bias from convective motions has been\ndetermined.  In principle, simulations of convection near the\nphotosphere (e.g., \\citealt{Asplund2003, Fleck2011}) could be used to\ncharacterize the expected center-to-limb variation in line centers,\nwhich could then be used to remove the modeled convective blueshift\nbias (but not any instrumental biases).  We are unaware of published\ncomparisons of observed and modeled center-to-limb variations in the\nHMI spectral line.\n\n\\begin{figure}[!htb] %\n  \\centerline{\\psfig{figure=f2.eps,width=4.0in}}\n\\caption{\\footnotesize \\textsl{Idealized convective motions near the\n    photosphere from center to limb.  Thick black arrows represent\n    velocity vectors.  Thin black solid lines represent stream\n    lines. Thick dashed line represents optical depth unity, and shows\n    granules' three-dimensional structure (e.g., \\citealt{Berger2007,\n      Carlsson2004}).  For an observer looking from the top of the\n    figure down, Doppler velocities along lines of sight (thin\n    vertical dashed lines) both at disk center and toward the limb\n    intersect more areas with velocities toward the observer than\n    away.  This is one reason that determination of the rest\n    wavelength by averaging (or taking the median) of line center\n    positions over the FOV will result in an estimate biased\n    blue-ward of the true rest wavelength.  This analysis ignores the\n    additional factor that upflowing plasma is brighter than\n    downflowing plasma, so the former contributes more to\n    intensity-averaged line profiles.}}\n\\label{fig:c2l}\n\\end{figure} \n\n\nThe goal of this paper is to describe a ``magnetic\ncalibration'' technique to estimate any spatially uniform bias in\nmeasured Doppler velocities. In basic terms, this method estimates\nsuch a bias by requiring statistical consistency between two\nindependent measures of changes in flux near LOS-field PILs, the loci\nwhere flux emerges and submerges: (1) $\\Delta \\Phi_{\\rm LOS}$, half\nthe change of total unsigned LOS flux near PILs over a time interval\n$\\Delta t$; and (2) $\\Delta \\Phi_{vBL}$, the amount of transverse flux\ntransported upward or downward across the magnetogram layer over\n$\\Delta t$, computed by summing the Doppler electric field --- the\nproduct of the Doppler velocity and transverse magnetic field strength\n--- along PILs.  This consistency relies upon both Faraday's law and\nthe assumption of ideal evolution.\n\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.  In the next section,\nwe describe our calibration method in greater detail.  We then apply\nthe method to the initial vector magnetogram sequence released by the\nHMI Team, starting with a description of our preliminary treatment of\nthe data (\\S \\ref{sec:data}) followed by a step-by-step demonstration\nof the method (\\S \\ref{sec:demo}) and analysis of its results (\\S\n\\ref{sec:results}).

        "introduction": "\\label{sec:introduction} \nGX~301$-$2 (also known as 4U~1223$-$62) is a high-mass \\hbox{X-ray} binary\nsystem, consisting of a neutron star orbiting the early \\hbox{B-type}\noptical companion Wray~977. The neutron star is a $\\sim$680\\,s X-ray pulsar\n\\citep{White:1976p993}, accreting from the dense wind of the optical\ncompanion. The wind's mass-loss rate of the optical component is one of the\nhighest known in the galaxy: \\hbox{$\\dot{M}_\\mathrm{loss}\\sim10^{-5}\nM_{\\odot}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$} \\citep{Kaper:2006p1357}.

The latest estimate is\n3\\,kpc~\\citep{Kaper:2006p1357}. The orbit is highly eccentric with an\neccentricity of \\ensuremath{\\sim}0.5 and an orbital period of\n\\ensuremath{\\sim41.5\\,d}~\\citep{Koh:1997p138}. The absence of X-ray\neclipses despite the large radius ($R\\sim43$\\,R$_{\\odot}$) of Wray~977\n\\citep{Parkes:1980p1360} constrains the inclination angle in the range\n$44-78^\\circ$ with a best-fit value of\n$i\\sim66^\\circ$~\\citep{Kaper:2006p1357, Leahy:2008p358}. The source\nexhibits regular X-ray flares about 1--2\\,d before the periastron passage\n(orbital phase $\\sim0.95$). There is also an indication of a second flare\nat orbital phase $\\sim0.5$~\\citep{Koh:1997p138}. Several hypotheses have\nbeen proposed to explain the observed orbital lightcurve, including a\ncircumstellar disk~\\citep{Koh:1997p138} and a quasi-stable accretion\nstream~\\citep{Leahy:2008p358}. Similar to other wind accreting systems, the\npulse period behavior of \\hbox{GX~301$-$2} on short time scales is\ndescribed well by a random walk model~\\citep{deKool:1993p147}.\n\\hbox{GX~301$-$2} exhibits a long-term pulse period evolution as well. The\nobserved pulse period remained \\ensuremath{\\sim}700\\,s until 1984 when it\nbegan to decrease during a rapid spin-up episode observed by \\textsl{BATSE}\n\\citep{Koh:1997p138,Bildsten:1997p2328}. The spin-up trend reversed in 1993\n\\citep{Pravdo:2001p360} and ever since the pulse period has been increasing\n\\citep{LaBarbera:2005p156,Kreykenbohm:2004p155}. \n\nThe X-ray spectrum of the \\hbox{GX~301$-$2} is rich in features. The lower\nenergy range is subject to heavy and variable photoelectric absorption\n\\citep{White:1976p993}. As shown by \\cite{Kreykenbohm:2004p155} and\n\\cite{LaBarbera:2005p156}, a partial covering model with two absorption\ncolumns is required to describe the spectrum. There is a complex of iron\nlines at $\\sim$6.4 to 7.1\\,keV~\\citep{Watanabe:2003p357}. A high-energy\ncutoff at \\hbox{$\\sim20$\\,keV}, together with a deep and broad cyclotron\nresonance scattering feature (CRSF) at $\\sim$30--45\\,keV, is present at\nhigher\nenergies~\\citep{Makishima:1992p3220,Orlandini:2000p153,Kreykenbohm:2004p155\n, LaBarbera:2005p156}. The CRSF is highly variable with pulse phase, and it\nexhibits interesting correlations with the continuum\nparameters~\\citep{Kreykenbohm:2004p155}. \n\nThe nature of accreting pulsars with long pulse periods is still poorly\nunderstood. Because of the low moment of inertia of the neutron star, the\naccelerating torque of the accreted matter can spin up a neutron star very\nefficiently. Braking torques are then required to explain the observed long\npulse periods. It is commonly assumed that the observed pulse period is\ndetermined by the equality of torques affecting the neutron star or relaxes\nto the value determined by this equality. Braking torques are generally\nassociated with the coupling of the neutron star's magnetic field with the\nsurrounding plasma. The drag force depends on the relative linear speed of\nfield lines at certain effective radius, which in turn depends on the\nmagnetic field strength. The efficiency of braking decreases for slowly\nrotating and weakly magnetized neutron stars so a strong field (up to\n$10^{15}$\\,G, \\citealt{Shakura:1975p2764}) is required to spin down a\nslowly rotating accreting X-ray pulsar even further. This results in an\napparent contradiction with field estimates obtained from the CRSF centroid\nenergy, which is\n$B\\sim(E_\\mathrm{cyc}\\mathrm{keV}/11.57)\\times10^{12}\\mathrm{G}\\sim4\\times10^{12}\\mathrm{G}$ \nin the case of \\hbox{GX~301$-$2} and in the same order of magnitude as for\nother sources. \n\nWe suggest that this contradiction may be resolved if the line-forming\nregion resides in an accretion column of significant height\n\\citep{Basko:1976p1538}, comparable to the neutron star radius. We\ninvestigate this hypothesis using \\textsl{INTEGRAL} and \\textsl{BATSE}\nobservations to study the spectral and timing properties of\n\\hbox{GX~301$-$2}."

        "question": "What is the typical frequency range of the synchrotron peak for high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs)?",
        "introduction": "Blazars, including BL Lac objects and flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs),\nare a special class of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that have one of their relativistic jets pointing very close to our line of sight \\citep[e.g.,][]{Urry1995}.\nFSRQs have luminous broad emission lines that are weak or absent in BL Lac objects.\nDue to Doppler boosting, the emission of a blazar is usually dominated by the jet whose spectral energy distribution (SED) shows two broad humps that smoothly extend from radio to $\\gamma$-rays.\nThe low-energy hump can extend from radio to soft X-rays.\nAccording to the frequency of the first hump,\nBL Lac objects are further divided into low-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (LBLs; $\\nu_{\\rm peak}<10^{14}$ Hz),\nintermediate-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (IBLs; $10^{14}<\\nu_{\\rm peak}<10^{15}$ Hz) and high-frequency peaked BL Lac objects (HBLs; $\\nu_{\\rm peak}>10^{15}$ Hz) \\citep[e.g.,][]{Padovani1995,Abdo2010a}.\nThe high-energy hump extends from hard X-rays to $\\gamma$-rays, even sometimes the very high energy (VHE) TeV band.\nSuch VHE blazars, typically HBLs, are called TeV blazars.\n\nThe low-energy hump is attributed to the synchrotron emission of highly relativistic electrons gyrating in a magnetic field in the jet.\nThe origin of the high-energy hump, however, is still debated.\nA popular explanation is inverse-Compton emission from the same population of relativistic electrons that produce the synchrotron emission.\nThe seed photons of the inverse-Compton scattering process could be local synchrotron photons (usually for BL Lacs)\nin the jet and/or external photons from the central engine (usually for FSRQs) or the cosmic microwave background.\nThese models are thus called leptonic models. The hadronic models, on the other hand,\nattribute $\\gamma$-ray emission to synchrotron emission of protons \\citep{Mucke2001, Mucke2003, Fraija2015a} or proton-induced cascades \\citep{Mannheim1998}.\n\nThe observed photon flux of blazars varies significantly across the electromagnetic spectrum on timescales from minutes to years \\citep[e.g.,][]{Wagner1995,Ulrich1997}.\nThe origin of the variability is not well understood.\nGenerally, the variability is noise-like \\citep[e.g.,][]{Kataoka2001, Chatterjee2012}, similar to the variability\nof radio-quiet AGNs \\citep[e.g.,][]{Markowitz2003}. However, blazars are also known to have bursts that show flare-like structures \\citep[e.g.][]{Marscher2010}, which\nmay have recognizable patterns \\citep{Sasada2017}. The outbursts can be explained by internal shocks of the jets when a new relativistic\nblob of plasma catches up with an old blob and accelerates particles to ultra-relativistic energies \\citep[e.g.,][]{Spada2001}.\nBased on several similarities between the jet emission and corona-disk emission,\nthe ultimate origin of the variability may still\nbe accretion-rate fluctuations of the disk \\citep{McHardy2008}.\n\nThe shortest variability timescale is a crucial parameter because it serves as an independent constraint on the physical scale of the emission region \\citep{Tavecchio1998}, which cannot\nbe easily provided by other observational measurements.\nBlazars are usually most variable at frequencies just above the two SED humps \\citep[e.g.,][]{Ulrich1997, Madejski2016},\nwhich usually fall in the hard X-ray and TeV bands in the case of TeV blazars \\citep[e.g.,][]{Aleksic2015a, Balokovic2016, Bartoli2016}.\nIn particular, an increasing number of TeV blazars show $\\gamma$-ray flaring activity on timescales from several to a few tens of minutes\nthat are detected by ground-based Cherenkov telescopes,\nincluding both BL Lac objects \\citep[e.g.,][]{Gaidos1996, Aharonian2007, Albert2007, Arlen2013} and FSRQs \\citep{Aleksic2011}.\nThe minute-scale variability in the TeV band \\citep[e.g.][]{Aharonian2007} has strong implications for our understanding of AGN jets \\citep{Begelman2008}.\nX-ray and TeV emission may be directly related to the same high-energy tail of the relativistic electron population.\nIndeed, the lightcurves of HBL-type TeV blazars in the X-ray and TeV bands are usually correlated \\citep[e.g.,][]{Aleksic2015b, Furniss2015}.\nAttempts to search for extremely rapid X-ray variability have been made \\citep[e.g.,][]{Cui2004, Xue2005, Pryal2015, Paliya2015}.\nThe same source can have minute-scale variability in both the X-ray band and TeV band \\citep[e.g., Mrk501,][]{Xue2005, Albert2007}.\nHowever, ``orphan'' TeV flares that have no X-ray counterparts are occasionally reported \\citep[e.g.,][]{Krawczynski2004, Blazejowski2005, Acciari2009, Fraija2015b}.\n\nRapid TeV variability has germinated various models to explain the small timescales.\nMost models involve some very compact regions moving in the rest frame of the jet.\nThese compact regions could be ``jets in a jet''\nthat are either produced by magnetic reconnection processes in a Poynting flux-dominated jet \\citep{Giannios2009}\nor relativistic turbulence in the jet \\citep{Narayan2012}.\nThe minijets-in-a-jet model can consistently produce the statistical properties of blazar flux \\citep{Biteau2012}.\nThere are also models involving a red giant star being stripped of its envelope by the jet \\citep{Barkov2012}\nand models involving beams of magneto-centrifugally accelerated electrons occasionally pointing toward us \\citep{Ghisellini2009}.\n\nSeveral well-studied TeV blazars show rich spectral behavior in X-rays, which may represent\nthe general behavior of the synchrotron peak of all AGN jets.\nThe X-ray spectra are usually curved \\citep{Massaro2004} and can only locally be fitted by a power-law.\nThe spectral variation with flux can be complex \\citep{Zhang2002, Cui2004}.\nGenerally, the spectrum hardens when the flux increases \\citep[e.g.,][]{Gliozzi2006,Xue2006,Tramacere2009},\nbut photon indexes can saturate at higher fluxes \\citep{Xue2005, Giebels2007}.\nThe synchrotron peak usually moves to higher frequencies with increasing flux during outbursts \\citep[e.g.][]{Pian1998},\nbut no correlation between the break energy and the flux exists when a broken power law is adopted to fit the X-ray spectra \\citep{Xue2005, Giebels2007, Garson2010}.\nA cooling break in the spectrum of emitting particles cannot explain these features \\citep{Wierzcholska2016b}, and\nsome special particle acceleration processes may be involved \\citep{Madejski2016}.\nThere are also energy-dependent lags between the variations of different energy bands.\nIn some flares, soft bands lag behind hard bands \\citep[e.g.,][]{Zhang2002}, while lags in the opposite direction can also happen \\citep[e.g.,][]{Ravasio2004, Sato2008}.\nHysteresis in the HR (hardness ratio)--flux diagram is often used as a diagnostic of lags.\nClockwise loops \\citep[e.g.,][]{Acciari2009, Kapanadze2016} in the HR--flux plane are a sign of soft lags\nwhile counterclockwise loops \\citep[e.g.][]{Tramacere2009} are a sign of hard lags.\nThe same source can exhibit both clockwise and counterclockwise loops;\nthe observed patterns are further complicated by the superposition of flares at different timescales \\citep{Cui2004}.\nThe above knowledge of TeV blazars in the X-ray regime comes from studies focusing on timescales of hours to weeks.\nWe will extend this kind of analysis to much smaller timescales in this paper.\n\nThe main goal of this paper is to search for X-ray flares at sub-hour timescales from TeV blazars\nin the entire \\textit{Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer} ({\\it RXTE}) archival database.\nWe use data from the narrow-field pointing instrument Proportional Counter Array (PCA) onboard {\\it RXTE},\ncovering a nominal energy range of 2--60 keV.\nThe {\\it RXTE} satellite was launched in December 1995 and ceased science operation in January 2012.\nDuring its lifetime, it accumulated more than $\\sim16$ Ms of exposure time on TeV blazars in hard X-rays, surpassing any other X-ray observatory.\nWe describe data reduction and the searching results in Section~\\ref{sec:reduction}.\nMost of our following analysis is based on an assumption that the observed photons are from\na flaring component and an underlying constant/slowly-varying component, possibly from two separated sites.\nWe describe lightcurve-model fitting and spectral-model fitting in Section~\\ref{sec:lc} and Section~\\ref{sec:spec}, respectively.\nWe discuss the implications of our findings in Section~\\ref{sec:discussion} and summarize them in Section~\\ref{sec:summary}.\nIn the following, we use the $\\Lambda$CDM model, with $H_0=67.7$ km/s/Mpc and $\\Omega_{\\rm m}=0.307$ \\citep{Planck2016}."

        "question": "What is the behavior of the comoving space density of star formation rate in galaxies at redshifts beyond z=2?",
        "introduction": "\\label{int}\n\nThe global star formation history (SFH) of the universe has been probed\nextensively by many different galaxy surveys, at many different wavelengths,\nsampling regions from the local universe out to redshifts approaching $z=5$.\nDespite uncertainties in star formation rate (SFR) calibrations,\nthe appropriate magnitude of extinction corrections at optical and\nnear-infrared wavelengths, and the heterogeneous nature of the many\ncontributing surveys, a remarkably consistent picture has developed.\nFrom $z=0$ to $z=1$ it is generally agreed that $\\rho^*$, the\ncomoving space density of the star formation rate (SFR) in galaxies,\nrises by an order of magnitude \\citep{Lil:96,Hog:98,Flo:99,Haa:00},\nand between $1<z<2$ a flattening is seen \\citep{Con:97,Yan:99,Haa:00,Hop:00}.\nThe behaviour of this evolution at higher redshifts however,\n\\citep{Mad:96,Ste:99,Hop:01}, is less well constrained.\nIt is still unclear whether\nthe evolution of $\\rho^*$ reaches a peak around $z\\approx1.5$ and decreases\nsignificantly thereafter \\citep[e.g.,][]{Mad:96,Gis:00}, or if it stays\nflat to much higher redshifts \\citep[e.g.,][]{Ste:99,Haa:00}.\nOne piece of evidence which may shed some light on this question\nis the SFH of our Local Group of galaxies. Several recent analyses\n\\citep{PS:98,Fie:99,Tol:99,Rich:99,Gned:00,Hog:01,Avi:01} emphasise the\nimportance of comparing this ``fossil record\" of our local Universe\nto the data from high-redshift surveys, and we present such a\ncomparison in this Letter."
