Subsequent studies have repeatedly mined the combined GOODS+HUDF observations, using deeper data and more rigorous analyses. At least 20 papers about high-redshift LFs using WFC3 data in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS have been published since 2010, augmenting at least a dozen others pre-WFC3. We cannot attempt to review them all here, but they have convincingly demonstrated that the UVLF evolves significantly at z>4. The current consensus is that this is primarily luminosity evolution, at least at 4 < z < 7, with L\u2217 brightening over time (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2007, 2012b; Grazian et al. 2011). As a result, the number density of bright LBGs increases rapidly with time, more quickly than does the integrated luminosity density. Analyses using the CANDELS and HUDF09+12 NIR imaging point to continued evolution out to z = 8 and perhaps beyond (Oesch et al. 2012, Yan et al. 2012, Lorenzoni et al. 2013, Schenker et al. 2013), although it would be prudent to recall that only a handful of galaxies at z\u22487 have reasonably secure spectroscopic confirmation and none at z>7.5. There is broad agreement that UV spectral slopes for LBGs are bluer at z>4 than at lower redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013), which has implications for their dust extinction and total SFRD. Most of these studies have examined the faint-end slope of the LF, measuring very steep values, in some cases approaching or exceeding the divergent value \u03b1=\u22122 (Bouwens et al. 2012b, McLure et al. 2013). Several studies have also extended SFRD analyses to 9 < z < 12, using data from the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011a, Ellis et al. 2013) or from lensing cluster studies (Coe et al. 2013). Although still in flux as better data accumulate, these measurements have considerable significance for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and for the reionization of the IGM (e.g., Robertson et al. 2013), but relatively little impact on the global star-formation budget of the Universe.

The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M\u2217, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M\u2217 correlation. For the \u201cmain sequence\u201d of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a \u201cdownsizing\u201d picture first introduced by Cowie et al. (1996). Dwarf galaxies continue to undergo major episodes of activity. The tightness of this SFR-M\u2217 correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH. Starburst galaxies, whose SFRs are significantly elevated above the main-sequence correlation, contribute only a small fraction of the global SFRD at z\u2a7d2 (Rodighiero et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2012).

In contrast to observations, they provide for controlled environments in which physical properties, histories, and futures of gas are all known and can be manipulated to tease insights out of the otherwise unmanageable complexity of a multiphase gaseous medium. As reviewed by Somerville et al. (2015), there are many schemes for simulating the development of the cosmic web and galaxies under the influence of dark matter, gravity, and hydrodynamics. The major methods at present are smoothed particle hydrodynamics, such as Gadget (Ford et al. 2013, Oppenheimer et al. 2016), Gasoline (Christensen et al. 2016, Gutcke et al. 2017), and GIZMO (Muratov et al. 2017); adaptive mesh refinement, such as Enzo (Hummels et al. 2013, Corlies & Schiminovich 2016); and moving mesh (Arepo and the Illustris simulation; Suresh et al. 2017). Large-scale cosmological simulations in megaparsec-scale boxes can simulate hundreds of galaxies in their proper \u039bCDM contexts (e.g., Oppenheimer & Dav\u00e9 2006, Ford et al. 2014, Vogelsberger et al. 2014). At the opposite end of the scale, very high-resolution simulations focused on the interaction between dense clouds and diffuse halos (e.g., Heitsch & Putman 2009, Armillotta et al. 2016) that can reach scales at much less than a parsec. Spanning these two regimes are the so-called zoom simulations, which resolve enough of the large-scale structure to accurately trace a single galaxy or a subset of galaxies selected out of larger boxes (\nFigure 3\n; Schaye et al. 2015). Even zooms must make assumptions about physics that they do not resolve, using \u201csub-grid\u201d prescriptions to stand in for such complex phenomena as star formation, metal mixing and transport, supernova and AGN feedback, and others. Sub-grid models are parameterized and tuned to yield specific metrics\u2014like the stellar mass function at z=0\u2014and then the properties that emerge\u2014such as SFRs, morphology, quenching, and the CGM\u2014are analyzed and compared with data to constrain the physical prescriptions that went in.

Indirect evidence for a hot phase comes from highly ionized metals that correlate with the low-ionization HVCs (Sembach et al. 2003, Fox et al. 2006, Lehner et al. 2009, Wakker et al. 2012), suggesting boundary layers between a hot medium and the colder HVCs.

This model has matured over the years into a strong line of theoretical research focused on the detailed physics of how the thermal, hydrodynamic, and ionization states of CGM gas evolve in dark matter halos. Placing multiphase gas into the context of the dark matter halo, Maller & Bullock (2004) suggested cold clouds cooled out of thermal instabilities in a hot medium while maintaining rough pressure equilibrium [though see Binney et al. (2009) for a counterpoint]. Accretion may also be seeded by gas ejected from the disk, as in the galactic fountain or precipitation model (e.g., Fraternali & Binney 2008, Voit et al. 2015b). These scenarios start with very simple assumptions\u2014such as hydrostatic hot halos, diffuse clouds in PIE, or particular radial entropy profiles. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because we do not know the large-scale physical state of the CGM as a whole. Photoionization modeling of the low-ionization CGM using only the EUVB (Haardt & Madau 2001) strongly disfavors hydrostatic equilibrium with hot gas at T\nvir (Werk et al. 2014); the cool and hot phases appear to have similar densities, rather than similar pressures.

This is in contrast to many (though not all) low-mass DM-dominated galaxies with well-measured rotation curves, which prefer fits with constant-density cores (\u03b3\u22480\u22120.5; e.g., McGaugh et al. 2001, Marchesini et al. 2002, Simon et al. 2005, de Blok et al. 2008, Kuzio de Naray et al. 2008; see also Walker & Pe\u00f1arrubia 2011). A related issue is that fiducial \u039bCDM simulations predict more DM in the central regions of galaxies than is measured for the galaxies that they should host according to AM. This central density problem is an issue of normalization and exists independent of the precise slope of the central density profile (Alam et al. 2002, Oman et al. 2015).

If galaxies form enough stars, there will be enough energy from supernovae to redistribute DM and create significant cores. If too many baryons end up in stars, however, the excess central mass can compensate and drag DM back in. At the other extreme, if too few stars are formed, there will not be enough energy in supernovae to alter halo density structure, and the resultant DM distribution will resemble DM-only simulations.

Such massive stars would likely end their lives as black holes with M\nBH \u223c 100 M\u2299 (e.g., Fryer et al. 2001), excepting first stars in the mass range of 140\u2013260 M\u2299 that would explode as pair-instability supernovae and leave no remnant (Heger et al. 2003). As shown by Madau & Rees (2001), if these first massive stars are rare, such that only about one is made in each high-density peak at very high redshift, then the number density of black holes would be well matched to the number of supermassive black holes today. However, growing from \u223c100 M\u2299 to a billion Suns in a fraction of a gigayear requires dramatic fueling (Haiman & Loeb 2001). Specifically, for a typical e-folding time of 45 million years, 14 such e-foldings are available at z = 7, but 17 are needed if the black hole grows at the Eddington limit (Madau et al. 2014, and references therein). Arranging this uninterrupted growth seems challenging even for these rare quasars (e.g., Johnson & Bromm 2007, Milosavljevi\u0107 et al. 2009).

This channel can only operate at very high redshift, because pristine gas is required to suppress cooling and fragmentation. Recent literature discusses in detail how rare the conditions may be to ensure that the gas does not cool and fragment into smaller units (e.g., Visbal et al. 2014, Habouzit et al. 2016), typically assuming that an elevated Lyman\u2013Werner background is needed (e.g., Omukai 2001).

For stellar-dynamical modeling, state-of-the-art codes use Schwarzschild modeling (Schwarzschild 1979) to jointly model the mass density of the central black hole, stars, and dark matter by orbit superposition (e.g., Rix et al. 1997, Gebhardt et al. 2003). The stellar-mass profile is modeled from the light, which is then converted to a mass profile by solving for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and if needed a dark matter halo component is also independently fitted (e.g., Gebhardt & Thomas 2009). The orbit families are weighted to match the spatially resolved stellar kinematical measurements. A major issue for all dynamical models is distinguishing between orbital anisotropy and mass (e.g., a black hole). This mass\u2013anisotropy degeneracy is well known (e.g., Binney & Mamon 1982).

Although only the mass at the very center of the halo is currently measurable, the extrapolated virial masses of UFDs are \u223c109 M\n\n (e.g., Strigari et al. 2008), and the halo masses at the time when the stars formed may have been \u223c108 M\n\n (e.g., Bovill & Ricotti 2009, Safarzadeh et al. 2018).

This combination of small halo mass and negligible baryonic mass makes UFDs extremely valuable laboratories for constraining the nature of dark matter. Simply counting the number of such objects around the Milky Way places a limit on the mass of the dark matter particle (e.g., Jethwa et al. 2018).

Furthermore, improved receiver sensitivities and larger bandwidth, together with multibeaming, increase the general sensitivity to all sorts of pulsars, as in the case of the phenomenally successful Parkes multibeam (PMB) surveys (Manchester et al. 2001).

The intense radiation would naively limit the BH growth below the critical Eddington value. However, does the Eddington limit really matter for the accretion rate? In general, AGNs appear to obey the Eddington limit on the luminosity, based on BH masses from reverberation measurements (e.g., Peterson et al. 2004). However, some X-ray binaries, such as SS 443 in our Galaxy (e.g., Okuda 2002) and some ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs), which are suspected to contain stellar-mass BHs (King et al. 2001, Winter et al. 2006), are believed to accrete at super-Eddington rates (Poutanen et al. 2007, Kawashima et al. 2012).

The predictions span a wide range, from no detectable events in the most pessimistic case up to several tens of events per year per unit redshift at z = 10, and a few events per year even at \n\n in the most optimistic models (for recent predictions see, e.g., Klein et al. 2016, Hartwig et al. 2018a, Ricarte & Natarajan 2018; for earlier studies that included the \n\n Universe see, e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Tanaka & Haiman 2009 and references therein). The most pessimistic scenario is for stellar-mass BHs to stay below LISA's detection threshold and for massive seed BHs to form inefficiently or to be unable to promptly merge when their hosts merge. The largest rates arise when abundant stellar-mass BH seeds are assumed to grow above LISA's \n\n103\u20134 M\u2299 detection threshold by z \u223c 10 or in models in which massive seeds are assumed to form efficiently in a large fraction of ACHs.

LISA data can indeed distinguish between a wide variety of models that include different prescriptions for seed formation, feedback, accretion efficiency, and accretion geometry (Sesana et al. 2011).

The LyC flux of an object can be measured via photometry or spectroscopy blueward of \u03bb = 912 \u00c5. The potential of interlopers means that high-resolution imagery, such as that provided by HST, is a key component of LyC direct detection campaigns. HST provides the ability to resolve nearly coincident interlopers using nonionizing flux (Mostardi et al. 2015, Shapley et al. 2016, Pahl et al. 2021) and to assess directly the LyC with reduced fear of contamination (Siana et al. 2015, Vasei et al. 2016, Rutkowski et al. 2017, Fletcher et al. 2019). Ground-based imaging in U-band or similar filters remains an attractive approach for constraining LyC at high-redshift, given their acceptable efficiency and availability on large telescopes (Guaita et al. 2016, Naidu et al. 2018, Me\u0161tri\u0107 et al. 2020). Imaging redshifted LyC also benefits from spectroscopic redshifts by preventing nonionizing photons from a source at an uncertain distance from contaminating the inference of escaping ionizing flux or at least quantifying the degree of contamination. Given the large intrinsic ratio of nonionizing to ionizing flux in the rest-frame UV spectra of these galaxies, and the small expected escape fractions, even a small amount of nonionizing flux mistaken as LyC can render conclusions about f\nesc unreliable. Spectroscopic determinations do not suffer from this uncertainty, but LyC campaigns with ground-based slit spectrographs are in principle not immune to foreground contamination. Perhaps a bigger practical challenge is conducting large campaigns with blue-sensitive spectrographs, which involves either the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) at low redshift (Izotov et al. 2016a,b, 2018) or significant investment with instruments like VLT/VIMOS (VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph) (de Barros et al. 2016; Marchi et al. 2017, 2018) or Keck/LRIS (Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) (Shapley et al. 2016, Steidel et al. 2018).

Such clouds could originate from thermal instability in the halo, cosmological accretion, or galactic fountain recycling (Fraternali 2017). The question of whether such clouds can survive and grow is crucial for explaining observations of IVCs/HVCs, as well as fueling of star formation in the disk (Putman et al. 2012). There is a crucial distinction between outflowing and infalling gas clouds. The latter gradually entrain, so destruction processes become weaker until the cloud comoves with the hot gas, and hydrodynamic instabilities are quenched. By contrast, infalling clouds never become comoving\u2014they accelerate under the action of gravity and have to survive unrelenting shear at the terminal velocity. HVC simulations often simulate a wind tunnel, which ignores this distinction, though some simulations include gravity (Heitsch & Putman 2009) and find cloud growth (Gr\u00f8nnow et al. 2022, Heitsch et al. 2022). Condensation in the cloud's wake means that it is largely composed of cooled halo gas; the contamination increases linearly with time and from head to tail, impacting cloud metallicities (Heitsch et al. 2022). However, the survival criterion is more stringent (Tan et al. 2023): t\ngrow \u223c \u03c7r/v\nmix < t\ncc (rather than t\ncool,mix < t\ncc). Survival is only weakly sensitive to cloud size. Instead, it is sensitive to cooling; a critical pressure is required for growth and accretion-induced braking. In our Galaxy, this corresponds to a distance of \u223c10 kpc from the disk; above that, clouds should fall ballistically and must be large enough to reach the zone of survival.

These authors argued that similar to the Jeans instability, where gravitational fragmentation leads to a characteristic scale \u03bbJ \u223c c\ns\nt\nff, fragmentation in cooling, pressure-confined clouds imprints a scale \u2113cloudlet\u223cc\ns\nt\ncool \u223c 0.1pc(n/cm\u22123)\u22121, where the quantity c\ns\nt\ncool is evaluated at its minimum at T \u223c 104 K. Although this length scale depends on the ambient pressure confining the clouds, the column density through an individual fragment N\ncloudlet \u223c 1017cm\u22122 is essentially independent of environment. Cooling of large (R \u226b c\ns\nt\ncool) clouds that subsequently shatter is easily triggered by large nonlinear perturbations (e.g., via turbulence). Shocks are particularly effective at shattering cold gas, via either compression of preexisting cold gas (Mellema et al. 2002) or fragmentation in the radiative shock (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Shattering can also arise during initially isobaric linear thermal instability,\n24\n once the cloud loses sonic contact with its surroundings as it cools (Gronke & Oh 2020b, Das et al. 2021). (b) Another avenue for producing small cloudlets is via mixing in KH instabilities; the tails of clouds in winds show a plethora of dense small clumps (Cooper et al. 2009, McCourt et al. 2018, Sparre et al. 2019), which have a column density distribution that peaks at Ncloudlet \u223c 1017cm\u22122 (Liang & Remming 2020), corresponding to the characteristic scale l \u223c c\n\ns\n\nt\ncool suggested for cooling driven fragmentation. \nFigure 11\n shows fragmentation by these two respective processes. Shattering due to thermal instability in halo merger shocks can produce very low-metallicity LLSs, far from any galaxy (Mandelker et al. 2019b).

Star clusters can retain such a shape but the gas between the stars cannot because cloud collision drives the gas to the plane on a few dynamic timescales. Maintaining a thick gaseous structure requires high-velocity turbulent motion, or outflow motion, and seems to work better in a clumpy medium where there are frequent cloud collisions (Beckert & Duschl 2004). Other mechanisms proposed to maintain a thick structure involve UV, optical, and IR radiation pressure (e.g., H\u00f6nig & Beckert 2007, Krolik 2007, Czerny & Hryniewicz 2011, Wada 2012); magnetic winds (Emmering et al. 1992, K\u00f6nigl & Kartje 1994, Elitzur & Shlosman 2006); and SF activity in the inflowing gas. UV-optical radiation by the central accretion disk, and locally (inside the torus) emitted IR radiation, can be combined into a plausible scheme that helps solve the scale height problem. Here clumps are pushed in the radial direction by the radiation from the central source in a way that depends on L\nAGN/L\nEdd (H\u00f6nig & Beckert 2007, Wada 2012). The central source heats the dust in the clumps, which in turn emit IR radiation. The local IR flux diffuses outward and is absorbed and reemitted by neighboring clumps, which results in a radiation pressure force that balances or overcomes the z-component of the central source gravity (Krolik 2007). In this scenario, an active AGN is necessary to both produce the toroidal structure and maintain its thick structure.", "citations": [["Krolik", "2007"], ["Beckert", "Duschl", "2004"], ["Elitzur", "Shlosman", "2006"], ["Shlosman", "2006"], ["Emmering", "1992"], ["Hryniewicz", "2011"], ["Wada", "2012"], ["Kartje", "1994"], ["Czerny", "Hryniewicz", "2011"], ["Duschl", "2004"], ["Beckert", "2007"]], "arxiv": ["0702396", "0605686", "1010.6201", "1208.5272", "0709.0431"]}, "1505.00811_3": {"title": "Revisiting the Unified Model of Active Galactic Nuclei", "question": " What are the different methods used to estimate the covering factor of AGN tori, and why do they sometimes produce inconsistent results?", "text": "As explained above, two categories of methods are used to estimate fC\n. The first category includes all methods for measuring the covering factor of individual objects (see Section 3): the L\ndust/L\nAGN method, the EW(K\n\u03b1\n) method, and the method based on the scattered X-ray continuum. The L\ndust/L\nAGN method results in the largest number of measured fC\n. The second category includes methods that apply to the mean covering factor of the population. This is obtained by classifying a source as either a type-I or a type-II AGN and using the resulting N\ntype-II,L\n/N\ntype-I,L\n ratio as an estimate of the mean value of fC\n. One such method measures the X-ray-absorbing column and determines the AGN type relative to a fiducial absorbing column that separates the groups (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003, Gilli et al. 2007, Hasinger 2008, Brightman & Ueda 2012, Malizia et al. 2012). Another method counts the number of broad- and narrow-emission-line AGNs in optical and IR-selected samples. Ideally, all methods should agree but this is not the case (e.g., Lawrence & Elvis 2010; Lusso et al. 2013, 2014; Mayo & Lawrence 2013). Mixed results are due to poorly understood physics of the torus, various selection effects, uncertainties in estimating L\nAGN, and intrinsic reddening, among others. For example, the L\ndust/L\nAGN method is based on dust emission from the torus and has little to do with BLR properties. However, X-ray absorption by gas in the BLR can increase the total measured X-ray column, thus decreasing L\ndust because the ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust-free gas never interacts with the dusty torus.

Only \u223c4% of the total accretion energy from TW Hya escapes as X-rays, as most of this energy is reprocessed into the ultraviolet-optical continuum emission (e.g., Alencar & Batalha 2002, Herczeg & Hillenbrand 2008, Ingleby et al. 2013). The fluxes in forbidden and intercombination lines of the helium-like ions of nitrogen, oxygen, neon, and magnesium have been modeled with accretion column models aiming to determine departures from the single-column model. The sophistication of these models varies from 1D, stationary models with nonequilibrium ionization (Lamzin 1998, G\u00fcnther et al. 2007b, Lamzin 1998, Brickhouse et al. 2010) to 1D and 3D MHD simulations including gravity, thermal conduction, and interaction with surrounding chromospheric material (Sacco et al. 2008, 2010; Bonito et al. 2014).

At early times (z\u22731.5) the galaxies grow by in situ star formation in the deep potential wells of massive halos. As the low angular momentum gas is efficiently converted into stars, some of the systems can be remarkably small (also supported by mergers; Wuyts et al. 2010, Bournaud et al. 2011a), very similar to the population of observed high-redshift compact galaxies (Sommer-Larsen & Toft 2010; Oser et al. 2010; 2012; Wellons et al. 2016). Toward lower redshifts in situ star formation becomes less important as cold gas can no longer easily penetrate the shocked hot gaseous halos (e.g., Birnboim & Dekel 2003), and the mass assembly becomes dominated by the accretion of stars that have formed in other galaxies. Cosmological simulations clearly indicate that stellar accretion is more important at higher galaxy masses (Oser et al. 2010, Gabor & Dav\u00e9 2012, Lackner et al. 2012, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016, Qu et al. 2017). This robust trend is also found in abundance matching estimates (Section 1.6) and semianalytical galaxy-formation models (Khochfar & Silk 2006, Guo & White 2008), and it is strongest for central galaxies in galaxy clusters (Ostriker & Hausman 1977, De Lucia & Blaizot 2007). The late, collisionless assembly has important consequences for the structural evolution of the system. As a significant fraction of mass can be accreted in mergers with smaller and less-bound systems (Gabor & Dav\u00e9 2012, Lackner et al. 2012), this stellar mass is added to the systems at large radii (Oser et al. 2010, Navarro-Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2013, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016, Qu et al. 2017). The resulting strong increase in galaxy size is driven by accreted stars. Simple arguments based on the virial theorem (Bezanson et al. 2009, Naab et al. 2009) show that the same mass added in many minor mergers will produce a much more extended galaxy than if that mass had been added in fewer, more major mergers (Equation 1, Section 1.5).

The typical velocity dispersion in newly born star clusters is \u223c1 km s\u22121 or 1 pc Myr\u22121. Assuming the cluster becomes unbound, massive stars can travel up to 40 pc before they explode (assuming typical supernova delay times for single stellar populations). These walkaway stars can therefore easily leave their dense birthplaces and explode in lower-density regions. As most of the volume of the ISM is not in the cold phase, most supernovae might explode in the warm or hot phase, significantly changing the coupling efficiency (Slyz et al. 2005, Ceverino & Klypin 2009). There is also the runaway star population (Gies & Bolton 1986) (about 45% of O stars and 15% of B stars are runaways) with typical velocities of \u223c30\u201340 km s\u22121 and maximum velocities as high as a few hundred kilometers per second (e.g., Silva & Napiwotzki 2011). These high-velocity stars originate from close binary systems becoming unbound by a supernova explosion (Zwicky 1957, Blaauw 1961) and/or from dynamical interactions in dense regions of star clusters (Poveda et al. 1967). They can travel up to several hundreds of parsecs away from their birthplaces far into interarm regions or the lower galactic halo. Their explosion locations in galactic disks can therefore be considered as almost random, similar to the explosions of type Ia supernovae, which contribute about 20\u201325% to the supernova rate in the Solar Neighborhood (Tammann et al. 1994).

Subgrid AGN feedback models generally assume that some fraction, \u03f5\nf, of the radiated luminosity of an SMBH accretion disk couples to the surrounding ISM: The AGN feedback energy \n\n, where \n\n is the accretion rate and c is the speed of light (e.g., Springel et al. 2005). As with stellar feedback, the injected energy can be coupled to the numerically modeled gas fluid in thermal and/or kinetic form. The simplest approach assumes that the coupling efficiency is fixed, such that the energy injection rate is proportional to the accretion rate. However, motivated by the observation that high-velocity jets are more typically associated with accretion onto SMBHs at small fractions of the Eddington rate (Churazov et al. 2005, Merloni & Heinz 2008, Best & Heckman 2012), some models adopt a relatively low (high) value of \u03f5\nf when the SMBH is accreting at a high (low) fraction of the Eddington rate (e.g., Sijacki et al. 2007, Dubois et al. 2012, Weinberger et al. 2017, Dav\u00e9 et al. 2019).

The development of simulations that can be used to stress test a truly comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution will require confrontation of the devil in the details. Simulations of the galaxy population do not accurately reproduce the internal and vertical structure of galaxies and their reliance on subgrid methods to approximate the influence of unresolved physics leaves lingering degeneracies that diminish predictive power. Furthermore, the simulations neglect physical processes known to be significant in certain regimes. From our suite of examples, only IllustrisTNG models magnetic fields, which could impact cosmic gas flows and thus affect the evolution of galaxies (Pillepich et al. 2018a, van de Voort et al. 2021). The omission of magnetic fields also precludes realistic modeling of the influence of cosmic rays, which, owing to their ISM energy density being comparable with those of the thermal and magnetic pressures, likely influence galaxy-wide outflows (Uhlig et al. 2012). Similarly, thermal conduction influences the structure of the ICM and cooling onto massive galaxies (Carilli & Taylor 2002) but is generally neglected. Modeling the UVB as a spatially uniform radiation field that \u201cswitches on\u201d at a fixed redshift is a particularly crude approximation for the evolution of galaxies during the EoR, when local sources of ionizing radiation can dominate the regulation of galaxy growth (Wise & Cen 2009, Trebitsch et al. 2017, Katz et al. 2020).

By far the most comprehensively studied region is the Orion complex.

Many super-Earths are \u227310 M\u2295, which is large enough to be the cores of giant planets. However, there are several important caveats to this connection. First, super-Earths have a different orbital period distribution than giant planets, with their occurrence rate dropping steeply with orbital period within 10 days (see Lee & Chiang 2017, and references therein), as we discuss further in Section 4.4. The relative occurrence rates can only be reconciled if it is much easier for cores to grow in gas giant planets very close to the star rather than further from the star, which is not what we expect from planet formation theory (Section 2.1). Second, in situ formation tends to produce multiple nearby planets (e.g., Hansen & Murray 2013, Becker et al. 2015), as we discuss in Section 4.2.

Lee & Chiang (2016) highlight this argument as the strongest against forming hot Jupiters in situ.

The planet exchanges angular momentum with the disk by perturbing nearby gas onto horseshoe orbits (via corotation torques) and deflecting more distant gas (via Lindblad torques). The net Lindblad torque tends to be inward (Ward 1997; see also Armitage 2013 for a pedagogical overview of migration torques). The strength and sign of corotation torques depend on the disk's turbulent viscosity, opacity, and radial entropy profile (e.g., Paardekooper & Mellema 2006, Duffell & Chiang 2015); for disk conditions, corotation torques can drive a net outward migration. As the planet deflects gas, it can clear a gap; the resulting reduction in its migration speed depends on the disk viscosity and scale height. It was once believed that a sufficiently massive planet could staunch the flow of gas across the gap and that the planet would move inward on the timescale of the disk's viscous accretion onto the star (type II migration). Staunching gas flow would have guaranteed inward migration at or above the disk's viscous accretion rate. However, recent simulations have shown that a significant amount of material passes through the gap on horseshoe orbits (e.g., Duffell et al. 2014, D\u00fcrmann & Kley 2015), and the type II migration rate can be slower than the viscous rate.

Secular interactions.\nSecular interactions are slow exchanges of angular momentum between widely separated planets. Secular interactions take place over thousands or even millions of years, depending on the separation and mass of the planets involved. Through secular interactions, a Jupiter can deposit its angular momentum into other planets or stars in the system on a timescale of many orbits. Planets can swap angular momentum periodically (e.g., Petrovich 2015b) or chaotically (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011, Hamers et al. 2017), driving the Jupiter's eccentricity to large values. The latter scenario requires three or more planets and is known as secular chaos. (Chaos can occur in hierarchical two-planet systems as well, but it requires large eccentricities and inclinations; see Wu & Lithwick 2011 for a discussion.) Kozai\u2013Lidov cycles are a type of periodic angular momentum exchange that also trade off mutual inclination and eccentricity (Kozai 1962, Lidov 1962, Naoz 2016). Kozai\u2013Lidov cycles can also occur in an initially coplanar system when the outer body is on a highly elliptical orbit (Li et al. 2014b).

In another scenario, multiple secular frequencies within a system coincide, creating a secular resonance that elevates planets' eccentricities (e.g., Minton & Malhotra 2011, Xu & Lai 2016).

In this model, galaxies form inside dark matter halos (White & Rees 1978). Most of the dark halos\u2019 properties (such as mass function, abundance number, etc.) depend on the characteristics of the cosmological model, including, for example, the power spectrum of density fluctuations, the type of dark matter, and the values of the cosmological parameters (as discussed extensively in Mo et al. 2010). Because in the concordance model there is \u223c6\u00d7 more mass in dark matter than in baryons (this is supported by measurements of, e.g., the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background; Planck Collab. et al. 2016), many of the properties of galaxies, such as how they cluster or their dynamics, are largely dictated by their dark halos. A direct example of this is the process of halo collapse and formation, during which dark halos attract baryonic material from which the (visible components of) galaxies can form. For the baryons in a gaseous configuration to be able to cool and form stars, several conditions need to satisfied (dictated by, e.g., cooling and heating processes and dynamical timescales; see Mo et al. 2010). If these conditions are satisfied, the gas will cool and collapse to the center of their halos while conserving some amount of angular momentum. This results in a gaseous disk that is rotationally supported (Mo et al. 1998), with some amount of random motion depending on the state of the gas (Bournaud et al. 2009). Note that, particularly in the early universe, gas can also be directly accreted as a cold flow and feed the forming galaxy (Dekel et al. 2009). In the cold gas disk, stars will start to form.

However, there is a simple explanation for why the halo should generally be older than the thin disk. Since mergers were much more frequent in the past, a thin disk could only grow to its full current extent after the major epoch of merger activity. The concordance model predicts that the first stars will form in the highest density peaks, which will collapse first and which are typically associated with the more massive objects at later times (e.g., Diemand et al. 2005). This would mean that the first stars in our cosmic environments ought to have formed in the proto\u2013Milky Way. Cosmological simulations suggest these first stars are likely part of the bulge or inner spheroid (White & Springel 2000, Tumlinson 2010, Starkenburg et al. 2017, El-Badry et al. 2018), whereas the outer halo is slightly younger. Thus, a slight age gradient (recall that we are discussing the epoch before the thin disk as we know it was in place) could arise from the fact that lower-mass objects typically form their first stars a bit later. Later accreted objects would also have continued forming stars longer and so contributed to the trend (Carollo et al. 2018). An age gradient was what Searle & Zinn (1978) discovered when studying the age distribution of halo globular clusters, and what led to their fragments model of the formation of the halo. Outer globular clusters are younger, and this is also apparent in recent studies of blue horizontal branch stars (Santucci et al. 2015). However, the age and metallicity distributions, particularly of the outer halo, could be rather patchy and could depend on the specifics of the merger history (e.g., orbits, time of infall) and mass spectrum of accreted objects (e.g., Font et al. 2006).", "citations": [["Font", "2006"], ["Springel", "2000"], ["Diemand", "2005"], ["Starkenburg", "2017"], ["Zinn", "1978"], ["El-Badry", "2018"], ["Carollo", "2018"], ["Tumlinson", "2010"], ["Santucci", "2015"], ["White", "Springel", "2000"], ["Searle", "Zinn", "1978"]], "arxiv": ["0507114", "9911378", "0506615", "1609.05214", "1804.00659", "1803.05154", "0911.1786", "1501.03559"]}, "2002.04340_3": {"title": "Streams, Substructures, and the Early History of the Milky Way", "question": " How do cosmological simulations compare to and inform our understanding of the Milky Way's stellar halo and merger history?", "text": "The general picture emerging of a few large building blocks dominating the inner stellar halo, with Gaia-Enceladus as possibly the largest, is consistent with that expected from cosmological simulations for a galaxy like the Milky Way.

Because massive stars have short lifetimes, their UV radiation (reprocessed in various forms) is the most observable tracer of star formation and is used to calculate star-formation rates (Kennicutt 1998, Kennicutt & Evans 2012). Feedback in the form of UV radiation, stellar winds, and supernovae (SNe) stirs interstellar gas, driving turbulence and perhaps triggering new generations of stars by sweeping gas into dense filaments (Elmegreen & Lada 1977). Through this feedback, massive stars have a profound impact on the evolution of disk galaxies (van der Kruit & Freeman 2011). Massive-star feedback may also terminate star formation locally, blowing giant bubbles (Cox 2005) and leaking hot processed gas into the Galactic Halo (Putman et al. 2012). Elemental yields from nuclear burning in the cores of massive stars and explosive nucleosynthesis in SNe provide the elements in the periodic table that pollute the ISM, driving galactic chemical evolution and the metallicity (Z) evolution of the Universe. Through their violent deaths as SNe, massive stars provide brilliant displays that permit us to dissect individual stellar interiors at distances of many megaparsecs while the star's inner layers are peeled away for us to see (Filippenko 1997).

Clumps are expected on a size scale comparable to the Sobolov length, given by the thermal velocity divided by the radial velocity gradient in the wind (dv/dr), which means that clumping should exist on a size scale smaller than the stellar radius.

These polar structures can extend to larger scales, as shown by imaging observations (e.g., Asmus et al. 2016). The physical origin of these features is still unclear but may be associated with an AGN-driven outflow (e.g., Schartmann et al. 2014). In addition, recent observations have cast some doubt on the notion of a compact torus being the sole origin of reflected X-ray emission, as is often assumed in the modeling of obscured AGN (e.g., Murphy & Yaqoob 2009, Brightman & Nandra 2011). Spatially resolved Chandra observations have found evidence for Fe K\u03b1 lines produced up to \u22481 kpc away from the nucleus (e.g., Bauer et al. 2015, Fabbiano et al. 2017). Taken together, these results suggest that emission features that have previously been attributed to a compact, axisymmetric torus may often originate from gas and dust with very different geometries.

The latter effect can be solved explicitly by taking into account dust and gas heating and cooling processes (Kamp & Dullemond 2004).

Against this concept, however, it has long been argued that the large accretion rate leads to off-center ignition and burning of carbon in the accretor to oxygen and neon. Further accretion and approach to M\nCh drives electron capture on Mg and Ne, leading to gravitational instability and to an \u201caccretion-induced collapse\u201d to a neutron star (Nomoto & Iben 1985, Saio & Nomoto 1998, Shen et al. 2012).

Recurrent novae are defined as novae with more than a single outburst over the past century or so. There are only 10 recurrent novae known in the Galaxy. Some of the donor stars are main-sequence, some subgiants, and some red giants. Recurrent novae have eruptions every few decades on an irregular basis. Because the mass needed for ignition scales inversely with both WD mass and accretion rate (Fujimoto 1982, Truran & Livio 1986, Shen & Bildsten 2009), these short recurrence times have been interpreted to indicate that the WD mass is close to M\nCh, specifically M\u22731.2M\u2299, and that the accretion rate is relatively high, i.e., the same parameters for which mass gain may be possible. A number of observational mass estimates are indeed suggestive of large WD masses, but uncertainties are large and there are only two double-lined eclipsing systems that have reliable mass estimates: U Sco, with a WD mass of 1.55\u00b10.24M\u2299 (Thoroughgood et al. 2001), and CI Aql, with 1.00\u00b10.14M\u2299 (Sahman et al. 2013).

This is the result of the net conversion of ionized gas from the CGM and IGM reservoirs into cold gas and stars (e.g., Wolfe et al. 2005, Prochaska & Wolfe 2009, Bauermeister et al. 2010, Zafar et al. 2013).

Just a decade ago, fewer than 25 transiting exoplanets were known, and the first directly imaged planets were just being discovered. Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres were still in their infancy. Prior to that, only a handful of atomic species were detected robustly, mostly in the two famous transiting hot Jupiters, HD 209458b and HD 189733b, using transmission spectra in the optical and UV obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; Charbonneau et al. 2002, Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003). The first detections of exoplanetary atmospheres using space-based IR photometry and spectrophotometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope (\nSpitzer\n) and HST were being made by Deming et al. (2005), Tinetti et al. (2007), Charbonneau et al. (2008), Grillmair et al. (2008) and Swain et al. (2008). The instruments used for these early measurements [such as the HST/NICMOS (Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer) and Spitzer photometric instruments] were never designed for exoplanetary observations, which require extreme sensitivities (e.g., photometric precisions better than \n\n). As such, the early measurements were intensely debated for their accuracy, and several were subsequently revised as the systematics were better understood and analysis methods improved. This is in stark contrast to the present day as high-confidence and reproducible detections of exoplanetary spectra with HST are routine, as discussed below. At the same time the first attempts for atmospheric observations from the ground were also being made (Redfield et al. 2008, Sing & L\u00f3pez-Morales 2009). Even so, inferences of molecular absorption and pressure\u2013temperature (P-T) profiles (e.g., thermal inversions) relied heavily on forward models with solar-like elemental compositions and equilibrium conditions (Burrows et al. 2008, Knutson et al. 2008). Statistical constraints on atmospheric properties of exoplanets using atmospheric retrieval methods were still a dream for the future. On another front, the first thermal phase curves, and brightness maps, were being observed for hot Jupiters using IR photometry with Spitzer (Knutson et al. 2007). At the same time, the first 3D atmospheric circulation models were being developed for hot Jupiters (Showman et al. 2008) to explain the observed thermal phase curves. In summary, about a decade ago major observational facilities were being pushed to their limits to detect spectra of transiting exoplanets.

After a rapid rise \n\n, the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR) volume density peaked around \n\n and subsequently declined as \n\n to \n\n.

Typical ion\u2013neutral reaction rate coefficients are \u223c10\u22129 cm\u22123s\u22121 with neither temperature dependence nor activation barrier, and thus ion\u2013neutral chemistry proceeds rapidly compared to neutral\u2013neutral reactions, which have typical rate coefficients of \u223c10\u221211 cm\u22123 s\u22121. Typical ionization rates in diffuse gas are inferred from observations of ArH+, OH+, H2O+, and \n\n to be \u03b6p \u223c 2 \u00d7 10\u221216 s\u22121\n per H atom (Hollenbach et al. 2012, Indriolo et al. 2015, Neufeld & Wolfire 2017; see also Shaw & Ferland 2021 for the effects of variable PAH abundance). Each ionization of H, H2, or He, by a cosmic-ray electron of energy \u227210 MeV, produces a secondary electron of energy \u223c35 eV that can further ionize another H or H2 (the fast cosmic ray being considered as the primary particle). The total rate including secondary ionizations in H and H2 gas is \u03b6H \u223c 1.5\u03b6p and \n\n, respectively, and depends in detail on the molecular and electron fractions (Glassgold & Langer 1974, Cravens & Dalgarno 1978, Dalgarno et al. 1999, Glassgold et al. 2012). Higher electron fractions result in more energy going into heat rather than secondary ionizations. The dependence of the ionization rate with column density into the PDR is not well known and depends on the incident cosmic-ray spectrum and interaction with turbulence and the magnetic field in the cloud (Padovani et al. 2009, Silsbee & Ivlev 2019). The low-energy cosmic rays are absorbed at increasing column density and decrease the total ionization rate compared to the rate at the surface.

Higher ionization rates initially increase the abundance of molecular ions (Hollenbach et al. 2012, Le Petit et al. 2016); however, for \u03b6p/n\n2 \u2273 10\u221214 s\u22121 with n\n2 = n/(100cm\u22123), the abundance of molecular ions decreases owing to the destruction of H2 by cosmic rays and because of an increasing electron abundance from ionizations leading to faster \n\n dissociative recombination (e.g., Le Petit et al. 2016). Increased ionization rates destroy CO by reactions with He+, requiring higher densities for formation and pushing CO deeper into the cloud (e.g., Gong et al. 2017). Similarly, internal sources of cosmic rays from, e.g., protostars can change the chemical structure by warming the gas in the interior and increasing the He+ density, which destroys CO and increases C (Gaches et al. 2019).", "citations": [["Indriolo", "2015"], ["Silsbee", "Ivlev", "2019"], ["Neufeld", "Wolfire", "2017"], ["Le", "Petit", "2016"], ["Glassgold", "2012"], ["Cravens", "Dalgarno", "1978"], ["Glassgold", "Langer", "1974"], ["Padovani", "2009"], ["Dishoeck", "2000"], ["Gaches", "2019"], ["Gong", "2017"], ["Wolfire", "2017"], ["Shaw", "Ferland", "2021"], ["Ferland", "2021"], ["Petit", "2016"], ["Dalgarno", "1999"], ["Hollenbach", "2012"], ["Ivlev", "2019"], ["Langer", "1974"], ["Dalgarno", "1978"]], "arxiv": ["1412.1106", "1904.01588", "1704.03877", "1205.6446", "1208.0523", "0904.4149", "1905.02232", "1610.09023", "2101.03732"]}, "2202.05867_3": {"title": "Photodissociation and X-Ray-Dominated Regions", "question": " What is CO-dark molecular gas, and how does its fraction vary with galactic conditions?", "text": "Using gamma-ray observations, Grenier et al.

The CO-dark layer is located at an A\nV \u223c 1 in PDRs, where H2 self-shielding creates a layer of H2, whereas CO forms deeper into the cloud (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). Wolfire et al. (2010) constructed theoretical models of the surfaces of illuminated molecular clouds and found, for local Galactic conditions, a CO-dark mass fraction of \u223c30%. Values of \u223c30\u201350% are roughly consistent with Galactic observations from gamma-ray observations (Grenier et al. 2005), dust emission from the Planck Surveyor Satellite (Planck Collab. et al. 2011), extinction from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (Paradis et al. 2012), [Cii] line emission from Herschel (Pineda et al. 2013), and mass estimates from numerical simulations of galactic disks where the CO-dark gas is found in interarm filaments (e.g., Smith et al. 2014; see also Kalberla et al. 2020). There is also a significant CO-dark fraction in the diffuse gas discussed in Section 7.3. The [Cii] and [Ci] emission can in principle trace the CO-dark gas but must be calibrated because the [Cii] also arises in Hi gas, and [Ci] misses the C+\u2013H2 regions. Models (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2010, Nordon & Sternberg 2016, Madden et al. 2020) predict the dark gas fraction should increase at lower metallicity because of reduced shielding of the CO, although Hu et al.

Since the last Annual Reviews article on exoplanet populations (Winn & Fabrycky 2015), the field of planet statistics has made significant progress. In particular, the large and homogeneous planet sample from the NASA Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010) has provided the best source for statistical studies, but a major shortcoming of the Kepler data was the initial lack of accurate stellar parameters for both the planet hosts and the target stars (i.e., the parent sample).

In fact, the existence of the radius valley at approximately the discovered position had been predicted years before its discovery (Lopez & Fortney 2013, Owen & Wu 2013; see a historic overview in Owen 2019), which is exceptional in exoplanetary science. The photoevaporation of the atmosphere is thought to mostly take place during the early ages of the system when the star emits a higher fraction of its total luminosity at high energy (\u2272100 Myr; e.g., Jackson et al. 2012, Tu et al. 2015, but also see King & Wheatley 2021). For close-in (\u223c3\u201330 days) planets with core masses of a few Earth masses, the high-energy radiation is sufficient to unbind the entire hydrogen/helium atmosphere if its initial mass fraction is below some critical value (a few percent; Owen & Wu 2017). The radius valley thus emerges, separating planets with and without extended atmospheres (Lopez & Fortney 2013; Owen & Wu 2013, 2017). The observed period and stellar mass dependences can also be well explained by photoevaporation. As the orbital period increases and/or the host mass decreases, the amount of high-energy radiation the planet receives decreases, and thus the valley moves to smaller radii (Owen & Wu 2017, Wu 2019).\n5\n We refer interested readers to Owen (2019) for a comprehensive review on the photoevaporation mechanism.", "citations": [["King", "Wheatley", "2021"], ["Fortney", "2013"], ["Jin", "2014"], ["Owen", "Wu", "2017"], ["Tu", "2015"], ["Wu", "2017"], ["Lopez", "Fortney", "2013"], ["Wu", "2019"], ["Jackson", "2012"], ["Wheatley", "2021"], ["Owen", "2019"], ["Wu", "2013"], ["Owen", "Wu", "2013"]], "arxiv": ["2007.13731", "1305.0269", "1409.2879", "1705.10810", "1504.04546", "1901.01974", "1804.05065", "1111.0031", "1807.07609", "1303.3899", "1210.7810"]}, "2103.02127_3": {"title": "Exoplanet Statistics and Theoretical Implications", "question": " What are the limitations of current approaches to modeling the intrinsic multiplicity distribution of planetary systems?", "text": "Although modeling the mutual inclination as a Rayleigh distribution (or more generally, Fisher distribution; Tremaine & Dong 2012, Zhu et al. 2018b) seems a reasonable choice (see also Tremaine 2015), the proper functional form for the intrinsic multiplicity distribution remains an open question.

They proposed an empirical method to evaluate the red noise on transit timescales from the individual light curves (analogous to the method proposed by Press et al. (1992a) to evaluate the correlation matrix of a quasar light curve), and then a prescription for adjusting the detection threshold accordingly.

Early studies by Nandy et al.

Many theoretical studies have predicted this effect (Witt & Gordon 2000, Pierini et al. 2004, Inoue 2005), but it was in particular highlighted by Chevallard et al.

A physical origin for the optical depth\u2013slope relationship was posited by Chevallard et al. (2013). Although the scattering albedo used by most theoretical studies is roughly constant in the optical, the phase functions are not: Red light scatters more isotropically than blue. Red photons emitted in the equatorial plane of the galaxy are more likely to escape, whereas blue photons have a comparatively increased likelihood of remaining and, subsequently, being absorbed. In the low optical depth limit, this corresponds to a steepening of the attenuation curve. In the high A\n\nV\n limit, the contribution to the UV is dominated by stars located outside the \u03c4 = 1 surface, and the shape of the curve is flattened by both scattering into the line of sight and radiation from unobscured OB stars (Narayanan et al. 2018a).", "citations": [["Witt", "Gordon", "2000"], ["Inoue", "2005"], ["Pierini", "2004"], ["Salmon", "2016"], ["Narayanan", "2018"], ["Trayford", "2020"], ["Silva", "1998"], ["Chevallard", "2013"], ["Jonsson", "2006"], ["Gordon", "2000"], ["Tuffs", "2004"], ["Salim", "2018"]], "arxiv": ["9907342", "0409183", "1512.05396", "1908.08956", "1309.0008", "1303.6631", "0503135", "0003285", "0401630", "1804.05850"]}, "2001.03181_3": {"title": "The Dust Attenuation Law in Galaxies", "question": " How do theoretical models explain the observed IRX-\u03b2 relation in galaxies, and what factors contribute to scatter in this relation?", "text": "A wide range of theoretical methodologies have been employed to understand expectations for the observed IRX\u2013\u03b2 relation in galaxies.

In our standard picture for such disks (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), radial pressure gradients and radial magnetic forces are unimportant, and matter follows almost test-particle orbits in the black hole potential. Once the accreting matter reaches the ISCO, it will plunge into the black hole on orbits that conserve energy and angular momentum. Thus, such accretion disks possess a distinct transition at the ISCO, from a turbulent, dissipative, circulating flow outside the ISCO to a laminar, nondissipative, plunging flow within. As a practical matter, the ISCO defines the inner edge to the region of the accretion disk responsible for observed emission. The strong spin dependence of the ISCO induces a spin dependence to four key observables from the inner disk, (a) the maximum observed gravitational redshift, (b) the maximum observed disk temperature, (c) the maximum temporal frequencies observed, and (d) the overall radiative efficiency \u03b7. The majority of spin measurements published to date are based, ultimately, on this hypothesis that the ISCO effectively truncates the observable disk (Reynolds & Fabian 2008, Shafee et al. 2008a). We stress, however, that the ultimate accuracy of this hypothesis is closely tied to the physics of the inner accretion flow, which is still the subject of very active theoretical work.

Mid-infrared scale length of dust.\n\nInfrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations helped assess the mid-IR (MIR) extent of nearby spirals (especially at 7 and \n\n). They showed that MIR and optical emissions have very similar morphologies and concentration indices (Boselli et al. 2003). However, the MIR scale length tends to be systematically smaller than the optical (Malhotra et al. 1996), and the arm/interarm contrast is larger in MIR than in optical observations (Vogler et al. 2005). From a large range of morphologies, Roussel et al. (2001) also found that, whereas the IR-to-optical size ratio does not seem to be affected by the presence of a bar, this ratio is particularly reduced in Hi-deficient galaxies and early-type galaxies (see also Bendo et al. 2002). Numerous analyses have shown that the MIR disk has a similar scale length to those of 12CO(1\u20130), H\u03b1, and the radio continuum (Sauvage et al. 1996, Walsh et al. 2002, Vogler et al. 2005). The relation with H\u03b1, in particular, indicates that the MIR scale length of a galaxy is determined by its star-forming activity. Indeed, MIR emission is enhanced in star-forming regions. With \nSpitzer\n, the improved sensitivity and spatial resolution opened a new frame to model the distribution of dust inside galaxies and, in particular, to derive radial profiles. Spitzer confirmed that the concentration index varies with the wavelength. Studying radial profiles of 75 nearby galaxies, Mu\u00f1oz-Mateos et al. (2009b) found that the concentration indices drop in the unidentified infrared bands (UIBs) (5.8 and \n\n; see Section 3.1.2). MIR observations at longer wavelengths indicate a wide variety of behaviors, including galaxies with very intense nuclear, circumnuclear, or outer-ring emissions and thus larger concentration indices (e.g., NGC 1291, NGC 1512, NGC 1097, NGC 3351).", "citations": [["NGC", "1512"], ["NGC", "3351"], ["Sauvage", "1996"], ["Roussel", "2001"], ["Bendo", "2002"], ["Malhotra", "1996"], ["NGC", "1097"], ["Walsh", "2002"], ["Mateos", "2009"], ["Vogler", "2005"], ["NGC", "1291"], ["Boselli", "2003"]], "arxiv": ["0104088", "0204072", "0508027", "9804020"]}, "1711.07434_2": {"title": "The Interstellar Dust Properties of Nearby Galaxies", "question": " How does the far-infrared/submillimeter scale length of dust compare to optical scale lengths in galaxies, and what do observations reveal about extended cold dust disks?", "text": "\n2.1.1.2. Far-infrared/submillimeter scale length of dust.\nFrom ISO observations, it quickly became clear that the disk scale length of IR emission increases with the wavelength (Hippelein et al. 2003), with a far-IR (FIR) scale length being greater than an optical scale length (Tuffs et al. 1996, Alton et al. 1998, Haas et al. 1998, Davies et al. 1999, Trewhella et al. 2000). This FIR color gradient observed in the disk suggests that part of the FIR emission arises from grains heated by the radially decreasing diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF). In the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891, Popescu & Tuffs (2003) showed that intense FIR emission was associated with an extended Hi disk, raising the question of whether grains are transported from the inner/optical disk, transferred via interactions or more resistant to destruction by shocks in the outer disk. Spitzer, \nHerschel\n, and plane- and ground-based submillimeter instruments have since revolutionized our vision of FIR/submillimeter emission and, in particular, have confirmed the detection of large, cold, extended disks (Block et al. 1994, Stevens et al. 2005, Hinz et al. 2012).

The PE heating is most efficient for the smallest sizes, particularly for the carriers of the UIBs (see, e.g., Weingartner & Draine 2001). This heating efficiency therefore depends on the dust properties and thus on the environment. Assuming that [Cii]\n\n is the main gas coolant, the PE efficiency, \u03f5PE, can be approximated by the gas-to-dust cooling ratio: \u03f5PE\u2243LCii\n/L\nTIR. Detailed studies usually add other lines to the gas cooling rate, such as [Oi]\n\n, to have a more complete estimate (see, e.g., Cormier et al. 2015). Overall, Smith et al. (2017) found that 0.1%\u2272\u03f5PE\u22721%, with an average of \u2329\u03f5PE\u232a\u22430.5%, in a sample of 54 nearby galaxies. It appears that \u03f5PE is lower when the dust temperature is higher (Rubin et al. 2009, Croxall et al. 2012). This is not likely the result of the destruction of the UIB carriers, as their intensity correlates best with the [Cii]\n\n emission (see, e.g., Helou et al. 2001). It is conjectured, rather, to result from the saturation of grain charging in UV-bright regions. The shape of the ISRF also has consequences for the accuracy with which L\nTIR represents the true UV PE-efficient flux. Indeed, Kapala et al. (2017) showed that the variations of \u03f5PE in M31 could be explained by the contribution of old stars to \n\n. Finally, one of the most puzzling features is that \n\n is higher at low metallicity (Poglitsch et al. 1995, Madden et al. 1997, Cormier et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2017), while the UIB strength drops in these systems (see Section 4.3.4). This is currently poorly understood. However, in the extreme case of I Zw 18 (Z\u22431/35Z\u2299), where no UIB is detected and the PE heating is estimated to be negligible, the gas-cooling-to-TIR ratio is still \u22431% (Lebouteiller et al. 2017).

More recently, a series of papers starting with Nayakshin (2010) have proposed that a combination of GI and tidal stripping can even produce rocky planets. Considering which disks are susceptible to GI and fragmentation reveals parameters unfavorable to the formation of planets but favorable to the formation of more massive wide-orbit companions. In Section 4, we have seen that unstable disks are massive, which leads to large initial masses for fragments; they are often undergoing rapid infall, which can enhance the subsequent growth rates; and they are experiencing rapid angular momentum transport, which can cause rapid migration and destruction of marginally bound objects (which are the most likely to be low in mass in the first place).

Garrod & Herbst (2006) presented a model of hot-core chemistry in which the surface mobility, and thus the reactivity, of radicals on grain surfaces would be enhanced by including the gradual warm-up of the gas and dust, which had previously been considered only in the context of the desorption of grain-surface molecules (Viti & Williams 1999, Viti et al. 2004). In these models, radicals are produced largely as the result of photodissociation (i.e., photolysis) of stable, solid-phase species such as methanol (CH3OH), caused by cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. Reactions between the radical products of methanol dissociation become prominent at temperatures of 20\u201340 K, resulting in the subsequent formation of many COMs. Many of those linger on grain surfaces until temperatures upward of 100 K are reached, where they sublimate and become observable in the gas phase. The models were expanded to include a larger network of radical reactions (Garrod et al. 2008) that was quite successful in providing a basic framework for the production of many COMs, which has been extended over subsequent years to include newly detected species (M\u00fcller et al. 2016a, Belloche et al. 2017, Garrod et al. 2017), especially toward Sgr B2(N).", "citations": [["Allen", "Robinson", "1977"], ["Hagen", "1982"], ["Garrod", "Herbst", "2006"], ["Viti", "2004"], ["Belloche", "2017"], ["Garrod", "2008"], ["Herbst", "2006"], ["Williams", "1999"], ["Viti", "Williams", "1999"], ["Garrod", "2017"], ["Tielens", "Hagen", "1982"], ["Robinson", "1977"]], "arxiv": ["0607560", "0406054", "1701.04640", "1703.09544", "1701.07160", "1708.07292", "0803.1214", "0803.1214"]}, "2006.07071_2": {"title": "Astrochemistry During the Formation of Stars", "question": " How are complex organic molecules (COMs) produced at very low temperatures without the need for diffusion of large radicals or initiating energetic processes?", "text": "A major area of new ice-chemistry research involves the production of COMs at very low temperatures without the need for diffusion of large radicals (thermally or otherwise), nor with any initiating energetic process. Fedoseev et al. (2015) found that codeposition of H and CO at low temperatures could produce COMs, which they suggest occurs through the production of glyoxal (HCOCHO) via HCO radical addition, which is subsequently hydrogenated to produce glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol. In this scheme, the low-temperature chemistry that produces methanol by hydrogen addition would allow more complex species to be formed in tandem. Reactions between HCO radicals would be the result not of diffusive meetings but rather of their occasional production in close enough proximity that little or no diffusion would be required. The HCO radical could also plausibly react with CO itself, mediated by an activation energy barrier but with little need to diffuse. Subsequent studies have highlighted cold pathways to other COMs, through deposition of additional species (Fedoseev et al. 2016, Dulieu et al. 2019, Qasim et al. 2019). In this review, we refer to such processes generically as nondiffusive, although they may indeed be initiated by the diffusion of H atoms, which are mobile even at very low temperatures. It seems likely that nondiffusive mechanisms could make a significant contribution to the COM content of star-forming regions. However, methyl formate does not seem to be produced in sufficient quantities to explain its interstellar abundance, and photolysis may therefore still be required (Chuang et al. 2016) if it originates in the solid phase.

For example, resolved CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) observations showed that cyanides peak at different locations from other species such as CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Friedel & Snyder 2008). A differentiation between N-bearing COMs (cyanides and NH2CHO) and O-bearing COMs (alcohols, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO) has also been inferred from differences in their excitation temperatures from Herschel observations by Crockett et al. (2015), who found that the former trace hotter gas (200\u2013300 K) than the latter (100\u2013150 K). However, the CH3C(O)CH3 emission detected with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) resembles more the cyanide emission than that of CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Peng et al. 2013, Feng et al. 2015), two COMs that were found to be strongly spatially correlated (Brouillet et al. 2013). To complicate the situation even further, Favre et al. (2017) demonstrated with ALMA that CH3COOH and (CH2OH)2 trace a more compact region located closer to the hot core than other O-bearing COMs. Analyzing a larger sample of O-bearing COMs detected with ALMA, Tercero et al. (2018) confirmed this result and showed that there is in fact a more general spatial segregation between the COMs containing a C-O-C structure and the COMs containing a C-OH bond, the former tracing the compact ridge and the latter the hot core. Tercero et al. (2018) interpret this segregation as resulting from the chemistry being dominated by different radicals in these two regions, methoxy (CH3O\u00b7) in the former and hydroxymethyl (\u00b7CH2OH) in the latter. One caveat in these discussions is that integrated intensity maps intended to trace a particular transition of a given COM may be contaminated by emission from other species due to the complex velocity structure of the Orion KL region (Pagani et al. 2017).

The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based adaptive optics provide subarcsecond resolution at visual and near-IR wavelengths. During the past two decades, wide-field imaging at visual and near-IR wavelengths has shown that outflows can be very large. Chains of HH objects with angular sizes of degrees in nearby clouds such as Taurus, Chamaeleon, and Orion indicate that outflows can be many parsecs in extent, with a few exceeding 10 pc (Ogura 1995; Reipurth et al. 1997a; Bally et al. 2006b, 2012a).

A highly collimated, low-excitation, knotty jet with a mean radial velocity of approximately \u2212100 km s\u22121 and proper motions of \u223c200 km s\u22121 emerges from the source.

The standard interpretation is that star formation in galaxies is separated into two processes: one in which molecular clouds are assembled from Hi and another in which stars form from H2 (Schruba et al. 2011). In fact, the key regulator of star formation appears to be not the formation of H2 itself but rather the formation of gas that is sufficiently shielded to reach very low temperatures so that thermal pressure cannot prevent collapse (Krumholz et al. 2011, Glover & Clark 2012). Hi can therefore be considered the fuel for star formation and the key ingredient responsible for the shielding and survival of molecular gas.

However, they fail to provide information on plasma conditions in regions where nonthermal pulsar radiation presumably originates. The magnetospheric current sheet was hypothesized as a source of multiwavelength, high-energy emission by Lyubarskii (1996b), even before the first self-consistent magnetospheric solution became available. In particular, FFE misses the physics of magnetic reconnection in the equatorial current sheet (e.g., Parfrey et al. 2012, Mahlmann et al. 2021), where the neglected plasma pressure and inertia terms become important. An obvious extension is to consider the full set of equations of relativistic MHD (e.g., Komissarov 1999), which capture the conversion of magnetic energy into plasma pressure in the current sheet. Such studies were performed for both aligned (Komissarov 2006) and oblique (Tchekhovskoy et al. 2013) rotators. However, the very low density of plasma in the magnetosphere, and, thus, its collisionless nature, implies that collisional fluid-based theories cannot correctly capture the physics of plasma production in the discharge and of reconnection in the current sheet. In particular, local studies of reconnection in pair plasma revealed that the anisotropic pressure tensor of heated pairs is important in setting the reconnection dynamics (Bessho & Bhattacharjee 2005). Thus, the E > B regions are possible at plasma microscales, and nonthermal particle distributions can be easily produced (Guo et al. 2014, Sironi & Spitkovsky 2014). Furthermore, the existence of the FFE solutions relies on the abundant supply of electron\u2013positron pairs everywhere in the magnetosphere.

The first process directly accelerates particles to energies of \u03b3 \u2248 few \u00d7 \u03c3, which roughly corresponds to the potential drop across the X-point (Werner et al. 2016), whereas the second process can accelerate to much higher energies. Near the light cylinder of young pulsars, however, the strength of synchrotron cooling is large, such that radiative losses become significant at \u03b3 \u223c \u03b3rad \u223c \u03c3LC, where \u03b3rad\n = 105(B\nLC/105G)\u22121/2, and secondary acceleration of pairs is not efficient. However, it can be important for the acceleration of ions extracted from the surface in the return current region (Philippov & Spitkovsky 2018, Gu\u00e9pin et al. 2020).

In this regime, called radiative reconnection (e.g., Uzdensky 2016), particles are accelerated in X-points, but radiate in plasmoids. Here, plasma particles quickly radiate a significant amount of their transverse momentum, i.e., pressure, which leads to a strong compression of the plasma to maintain the balance between the plasma and magnetic pressure across the current sheet. The resulting cross-layer pressure balance and the energy balance between reconnection-powered heating and synchrotron cooling fully set the plasma temperature, the width of the current sheet, and characteristic sizes of plasmoids (Lyubarskii 1996a, Uzdensky & Spitkovsky 2014).", "citations": [["Cerutti", "2013"], ["Petropoulou", "Sironi", "2018"], ["Hakobyan", "2021"], ["Hakobyan", "2019"], ["Philippov", "Spitkovsky", "2018"], ["Uzdensky", "2016"], ["Sironi", "2018"], ["Spitkovsky", "2018"], ["Werner", "2016"], ["Spitkovsky", "2014"], ["Zhang", "2021"], ["Uzdensky", "Spitkovsky", "2014"], ["Lyubarskii", "1996"]], "arxiv": ["1302.6247", "1808.00966", "2006.12530", "1809.10772", "1707.04323", "1507.07756", "1411.4295", "1409.8262", "1312.4970", "1401.5471", "1210.3346", "2105.00009"]}, "Pulsar_3": {"title": "Pulsar Magnetospheres and Their Radiation", "question": " What are the challenges in developing a self-consistent theory of coherent curvature radiation as the mechanism for pulsar radio emission?", "text": "A more self-consistent approach, that of the second class, is focused on identifying a possible plasma instability in the outflow that can lead to maser amplification of the curvature radiation.

To first order, the basic atmospheric parameters that define the model are effective temperature (T\neff), surface gravity (log g), and chemical composition ([M/H], where M refers to metals). We refer the reader to Gray (2005) and Gustafsson et al. (2008) for the concepts associated with stellar atmosphere modeling. For details of the more realistic and rigorous three-dimensional (3D) model atmosphere and non-LTE (hereafter NLTE) formalisms, rather than the 1D/LTE approximations, see Asplund (2005), and the references therein; examples of recent developments in these areas are found in Lind et al. (2012), Ludwig & Ku\u010dinskas (2012), Magic et al. (2013), and Tremblay et al. (2013). We have discussed the corresponding abundance differences that result from these two approaches previously (Frebel & Norris 2013, see their figure 11) to which we refer the reader for details. In brief, differences between LTE and NLTE results, on the one hand, and between 1D and 3D analyses, on the other, are of an order \u223c0.5 dex for some atomic species. Three-dimensional corrections for the hydrides of C, N, and O are \u223c0.5\u20131.0 dex, in the sense that 1D abundances are higher. We note also that LTE/NLTE and 1D/3D differences, determined independently, are not always necessarily in the same direction; and, thus, to some extent, the criticisms that apply to 1D/LTE results remain if only one of the two improvements has been made, as opposed to a complete 3D/NLTE analysis. In general the results of the more rigorous, but very computationally challenging, 3D/NLTE formalism are always to be preferred, if available. In what follows, unless otherwise stated, we present abundances from the more widely used 1D/LTE procedures, which have produced results for a much larger sample of stars. The rationale for this is that it is unwise to mix the results of the 1D/LTE and 3D/NLTE formalisms when investigating abundance trends and objects with apparently anomalous compositions. In contrast, one must bear in mind the problems that could occur if 1D/LTE abundances, rather than the more rigorous 3D/NLTE values, are compared with those of, for example, stellar evolution computations, other theoretical predictions, and nonstellar (e.g., Damped Ly\u03b1) systems.", "citations": [["Asplund", "2005"], ["Lind", "2012"], ["Frebel", "Norris", "2013"], ["Magic", "2013"], ["Tremblay", "2013"], ["Norris", "2013"], ["Gray", "2005"], ["Gustafsson", "2008"]], "arxiv": ["1102.1748"]}, "1501.06921_2": {"title": "Near-Field Cosmology with Extremely Metal-Poor Stars", "question": " How has the discovery of the most metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo progressed over time, and what are the current observational limits?", "text": "The history of the discovery of the most metal-poor stars in the halo is shown in \nFigure 3\n, which presents the abundance of calcium, [Ca/H], of the most calcium-poor star then known as a function of the epoch.

The higher of the two limits is the prediction by Iben (1983) of [Fe/H] = \u22125.7 (assuming [Ca/Fe] = 0.3) as the putative surface value a zero heavy-element abundance star would acquire by accretion of the Galactic interstellar material over the past 10 Gyr, assuming a time-averaged accreted abundance of [Fe/H] = \u22120.6. Insofar as the Iben calculation is a back-of-the-envelope calculation, one should not be surprised that a star has been observed below this limit. The lower line, in contrast, is the more restrictive limit of Frebel & Norris (2013), which is the calcium abundance one might determine for a very low upper limit of the observed Caii K line strength of 20 m\u00c5 in a putative metal-poor red giant having T\neff=4, 500 K and log g = 0.5.

First, steady progress has been made over the past six decades to find stars with lower and lower metallicities (notwithstanding the one to two decade periods without progress). Second, we have most likely come to the point where further progress for identifying stars with lower abundances will be very slow.

Pringle (1991) suggested that the strong gravitational torque from the binary on the CBD prevents accretion, and therefore the binary loses angular momentum to the disk (see Section 2). Gas accretion changes the picture completely. Only a few previous studies addressed the issue of angular momentum transfer in a quantitative way. Examples include MacFadyen & Milosavljevi\u0107 (2008) and Shi et al. (2012), whose simulations excise the inner cavity. MacFadyen & Milosavljevi\u0107 (2008) considered H/r = 0.1 and a disk viscosity with \u03b1 = 0.01 and adopted a polar grid in the domain between r\nin = a\nb and r\nout = 100a\nb. They found a reduction of mass accretion onto the binary and the dominance of the gravitational torque relative to advective torque (therefore a negative net torque on the binary). However, with their small \u03b1 parameter, the \u201cviscous relaxation\u201d radius at t = 4,000P\nb (the typical duration of their runs) is only about 3a\nb, and their surface density profile is far from steady state even at r \u223c r\nin. So it is likely that the result of MacFadyen & Milosavljevi\u0107 (2008) reflects a \u201ctransient\u201d phase of their simulations. Shi et al. (2012) obtained a positive value of \n\n in their 3D MHD simulations of CBDs (truncated at r\nin = 0.8a\nb). However, the duration of their simulations is only \u223c100P\nb, and it is unlikely that a quasi-steady state is reached. Their value of l\n0, which is too small to cause orbital expansion, may not properly characterize the long-term evolution of the binary. Tang et al. (2017) carried out simulations of accretion onto circular binaries using DISCO (Duffell & MacFadyen 2012, Duffell 2016) with h = 0.1 and \u03b1 = 0.1. For the accretion prescription, they assumed that inside a \u201csink\u201d radius (measured from each \u201cstar\u201d), the gas is depleted at a rate of d\u03a3/dt = \u2212\u03a3/t\nsink, with t\nsink being a free parameter. They claimed that the net torque on the binary is negative unless t\nsink is much less than P\nb. This result is in contradiction with those of Mu\u00f1oz et al. (2019) and Moody et al. (2019); the latter adopted a similar accretion prescription and did not find the same behavior as Tang et al. (2017). More recent works using DISCO (Duffell et al. 2020, D'Orazio & Duffell 2021, Dittmann & Ryan 2021) and the Cartesian-grid code Mara3 (Tiede et al. 2020, Zrake et al. 2021) have produced similar results as those of Mu\u00f1oz et al.

The most compact, directly imaged MBHB on record is the dual AGNs in the radio galaxy 0402+379, with a projected separation of 7.3 pc (Rodriguez et al. 2006). For more compact sources, photometric and spectroscopic techniques can be used to infer the presence of MBHBs. Circumbinary accretion may prove crucial for upcoming multimessenger efforts to identify such compact MBHBs in the form of periodically varying electromagnetic (EM) counterparts (e.g., Bogdanovi\u0107 et al. 2022, Charisi et al. 2022). The sought-after periodic signals in time-variable AGNs include (a) time-variable kinematic offsets of the broad emission lines (Gaskell 1996), (b) Doppler-boosted broad-band emission from the circumsecondary accretion disk (D'Orazio et al. 2015), (c) periodic self-lensing flares (D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018, Hu et al. 2020), and (d) broadband photometric variability due to pulsed/modulated accretion (e.g., Tang et al. 2018). In practice, the kinematics approach is of limited use at subparsec because of the confusion and truncation of the distinct broad-line regions at these separations (Kelley 2021), making the photometric approach a more viable and data-rich technique (e.g., Charisi et al. 2022). Indeed, systematic searches for periodic signals in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (Graham et al. 2015), the Palomar Transient Factory (Charisi et al. 2016), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Liu et al. 2019b) have revealed hundreds of MBHB candidates. Measuring photometric variability is not exempt from systematic uncertainties (Graham et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016, Witt et al. 2022) but has the potential of being a powerful multimessenger tool in combination with simultaneous GW detections (Charisi et al. 2022). At subparsec separations, MBHBs emit GWs in the frequencies suitable for PTAs, which are forecast to provide individual binary detections within the next decade (Mingarelli et al. 2017, Kelley et al. 2018). In this regime, the binary orbit is still essentially Newtonian, and the associated GW waveforms are well understood. Likewise, the known photometric variability mechanisms (accretion/boosting/lensing) are all modulated on timescales commensurate with the binary orbit.

The continuum gamma-ray (\u2273100 MeV) emission observed by Fermi-LAT is clear evidence of the acceleration of relativistic particles by shocks (Martin & Dubus 2013).

This expansion is accompanied by the onset of mass loss, which is variously modeled as an impulsive shell ejection (e.g., Shore 2014, Mason et al. 2018), a continuous wind (Kato & Hachisu 1994), or a combination of the two (e.g., Friedjung 1987).

These data showed the widespread presence of P Cygni profiles in UV resonance lines, such as carbon iv, silicon iv, and nitrogen v, which were interpreted as stationary outflows that might be sufficiently strong to affect massive star evolution (Morton 1967, Lamers & Morton 1976).

Similarly, the distribution of aligned grains can be derived from the wavelength-dependent polarization curve (Mathis 1986, Kim & Martin 1995, Draine & Fraisse 2009). The resulting total grain population is made up of large (\u223c0.01\u20131 \u03bcm) and very small (\u223c0.001\u20130.01 \u03bcm) grains and of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) macromolecules (e.g., Compi\u00e8gne et al. 2011).

These torques can spin the grains up to suprathermal velocities and also act to align the grains. In the presence of a magnetic field the grain rotational axis precesses about the field while the radiative torques act to align the grain with the field (Draine & Weingartner 1997).

Thus, the lack of polarization in this spectral feature indicates that carbon grains are not aligned. This is supported by the fact that in models of the FIR-to-submillimeter polarization spectra by Draine & Fraisse (2009), only those assuming spherical carbon grains (equivalent to nonalignment) match the observations (Vaillancourt & Matthews 2012; Section 3.5).

Both phenomena are closely related, and their importance for stellar evolution depends on the mass of the star. About 10% of intermediate- and high-mass stars have a detectable stable large-scale structured fossil magnetic field left from their formation and previous convective phases at the current threshold of Caii H & K absorption lines or spectropolarimetry based on Zeeman splitting (typically of a few Gauss; Donati & Landstreet 2009, Wade et al. 2016). This percentage agrees with the broad distribution of the measured spectroscopic projected equatorial surface rotation velocity, \n\n (e.g., Zorec & Royer 2012). The physical interpretation is that such stars are born without or with only a thin convective envelope, preventing the creation of a magnetic dynamo in their outer layers. In the absence of the latter, they do not experience a strong magnetized wind and therefore do not lose much angular momentum. Although stars born with a mass above some \u223c15,Modot; do experience a considerable radiation-driven wind (Kudritzki & Puls 2000) and lose angular momentum efficiently, most stars with \n\nM\u2299 roughly keep their original J received at birth during the main sequence. Aside from these considerations for the stellar envelope, high- and intermediate-mass stars may have a magnetic dynamo in their convective core region. The strength and properties of such an interior field cannot be measured directly, as it is shielded by the extended overlying radiative envelope. Indirect evidence of the existence of interior fields, with strengths above \u223c105 Gauss, was deduced from depressed dipole modes found in Kepler data of hundreds of red giants (Fuller et al. 2015, Cantiello et al. 2016). If these dipole modes undergo suppression by an interior magnetic field in the radiative core, then such a field must occur in about half of the progenitor main-sequence stars (Stello et al. 2016). However, Mosser et al. (2017) argue that mixed modes (i.e., modes with a g-mode character that are not pure p modes) are still detected in these stars and, hence, cannot be fully suppressed in their radiative core. Mosser et al. (2017) postulate the strongly reduced amplitudes of the dipole modes to be due to a yet unknown damping effect. Ongoing research approaches this topic from a complementary angle: The hypothesis that half of the progenitors of red giants must have a strong interior magnetic field in their convective core with properties derived by Cantiello et al. (2016), as deduced by Stello et al. (2016), is currently being tested from the effect of the acting Coriolis and Lorentz forces on the frequencies of detected gravity modes in intermediate-mass stars. Irrespective of the future outcome of this ongoing debate, the best approach for asteroseismology is to ignore core and surface magnetism in the computation of equilibrium models for the mass range of \n\nM\u2299 and to focus on rotation as the prime cause of complexity in 1D stellar models (e.g., Georgy et al. 2013) and in asteroseismology (Buysschaert et al. 2018).

Such spacings were detected from ground-based photometry for white dwarfs long before space asteroseismology (see, e.g., Kawaler et al. 1999, for an overview).

(2015) and Nielsen et al. (2017) achieved the envelope and surface rotation rates of 27 such single stars, covering a mass range from 1.0 to 1.6 M\u2299. This revealed nearly uniform radial envelope rotation with average rotation values covering \n\nHz for the sample, in agreement with the spectroscopic \n\n values. By contrast, Benomar et al. (2018) studied latitudinal differential rotation in 40 low-mass main-sequence stars in this mass range and found 13 of these to reveal significantly slower polar than equatorial rotation, a phenomenon that also occurs for the Sun (Thompson et al. 2003). Asteroseismic inversions to derive the latitudinal rotation law in the envelope, \n\n, revealed the magnitude of the angular differentiality to be larger than that for the Sun, with latitudinal shear factors between the equator and at midlatitude ranging from \u22121.4 to \u22120.27 (Benomar et al. 2018, their table S3). Such a level of observed latitudinal shear is much larger than predictions from theory and numerical simulations for the Sun and solar-like stars (Hotta et al. 2015, Brun et al. 2017). Although the 13 stars have faster average envelope rotation than the Sun, with \n\nHz when adopting a latitudinal rotation law as for the Sun, the asteroseismic inference of these shear values points to large anisotropy in the turbulence, accompanied by efficient angular momentum transport. These asteroseismic results remain unexplained so far. Such a level of shear is not found from the 3D numerical simulations for red giants by Brun & Palacios (2009), who derived antisolar latitudinal differential rotation and strong radial differential rotation in the slowly rotating outer envelope, as it would occur from conservation of specific angular momentum by individual convective flows.

The motion of the stars follow almost perfect Keplerian orbits, even for stars like S2 that passes the central source as close as \n\n (Schwarzschild radius: R\nS = 2GM/c\n2). Following the pericenter passage of S2 in 2002, it became clear that the first-order general relativity (GR) effects will come in reach with precision observations (Rubilar & Eckart 2001). Despite the fact that a black hole is a genuine prediction of GR, the signatures of GR on the stellar orbits with the leading post-Newtonian terms (O(\u03b22), \u03b2 = v/c), namely gravitational redshift and Schwarzschild precession, are small perturbations w.r.t. the Keplerian motion (for a review, see Alexander 2005). The gravitational redshift scales with \u03b22 \u2248 R\nS/R. In case of S2, the effect is approximately \n\n compared to the maximum velocity of \n\n at pericenter passage. The Schwarzschild precession rotates the elliptical orbit by \u224812.1 arcmin per 16 years revolution. In order to measure the effects, a significant improvement (by a factor of 4\u201310) in astrometry compared to what was possible in 2010 was needed. This posed one of the main science drivers for the development of the GRAVITY instrument (Eisenhauer et al. 2008, Paumard et al. 2008).

By simultaneously monitoring the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2018a) were able to detect the gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect at high significance (later confirmed by Do et al. 2019). The statistical robustness of the redshift detection was further improved by GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2019a) to more than 20\u03c3 significance. Amorim et al. (2019) used two atomic transition lines in the spectrum of S2 to test one pillar of the Einstein equivalence principle and, thus, GR and the local position invariance (LPI). By separately measuring the redshift of the hydrogen and helium lines in the stellar spectrum, effectively two independent clocks can be probed, while moving through the black hole's gravitational potential.

Temperature measurements are interesting because they constrain different energy injection processes into the IGM and because the IGM temperature sets the minimum mass of galaxies (see the sidebar The Minimum Mass of Galaxies). Temperature measurements rely on the width of Ly\u03b1 absorption features from the low-density IGM being broader with higher temperatures, because of both thermal broadening and, to a lesser extent, the broadening owing to pressure effects. A variety of methods to determine temperature are used, ranging from directly fitting for the width of absorption lines as a function of N\nHI (Schaye et al. 1999) to measuring the suppression at high wavenumbers in the Ly\u03b1 forest power spectrum that owes principally to thermal broadening (Theuns et al. 2000, Zaldarriaga et al. 2001). All methods must be calibrated with simulations. The spate of IGM temperature measurements near the turn of the century generally found fairly high temperatures over the range 2<z<4, with temperatures at the mean density of T\n0=(20\u201330)\u00d7103K, although with a large amount of scatter and large statistical errors of \u223c(5\u201310)\u00d7103 K.

After \u201canomalous\u201d RMs are discarded if their values deviate from the average of their neighbors by more than 3\u03c3, which probably results from the large intrinsic RMs, the \u201ccleaned\u201d RM sky shows a striking antisymmetry to Galactic coordinates (\nFigure 6\n): positive RMs dominating above but negative RMs below the Galactic plane in the first quadrant (l<90\u00b0), and RMs reversing their signs in the fourth quadrant (l>270\u00b0).

Recalling that positive RMs indicate the averaged magnetic fields with a direction pointing toward us along the line of sight, whereas in negative RMs the fields point away from us, the antisymmetry of the RM sky has been interpreted as an indication of toroidal magnetic fields in the Galactic halo with reversed field directions below and above the Galactic plane (Han et al. 1997, 1999b). This configuration is consistent with the magnetic field in the concentrated halo described by Sofue & Fujimoto (1987; see their figure 1b) or the field of the A0 dynamo (see Wielebinski & Krause 1993, their figure 10).

The model-fitting method was also applied to fit the RM distribution of extragalactic radio sources behind the Galactic disk (e.g., Simard-Normandin & Kronberg 1980, Sofue & Fujimoto 1983). With the reasonable assumption that magnetic fields always follow the spiral arms, as inferred from polarization images of nearby galaxies (see Section 4.3), the large-scale structure of magnetic fields can be outlined from the derived parallel magnetic fields in those disk regions in which pulsar RMs have been observed. Han et al. (2006) analyzed the pulsar data in the tangential regions of spiral arms and showed that the magnetic fields in the spiral arms (i.e., the Norma arm, the Scutum-Crux arm, and the Carina-Sagittarius arm) are always counterclockwise (though some disordered fields appear in some segments of some arms), and that magnetic fields in the interarm regions are reversed to be clockwise. The field reversals have also been shown by Noutsos et al. (2008) and Nota & Katgert (2010) by using pulsar RM data. Up to now, RMs have been measured for more than 1,100 pulsars. By using the RM and DM differentiation method for pulsar RMs and DMs, and also comparing RMs of foreground pulsars with RMs of background radio sources, J.L. Han, R.N. Manchester, W. van Straten, and P. Demorest (in preparation) recently confirmed the multiple reversals of magnetic fields in the Galactic disk, as shown in \nFigure 8\n. RMs of radio sources behind the Galactic disk are averaged after the outliers were discarded and then compared with RMs of the farthest pulsars to judge if there is a magnetic field reversal in the regions beyond pulsars. Because of the sparsity of pulsar RM data and distance uncertainties, there are still uncertainties about exactly where the reversals take place.

However, at low redshift and at least up to z \u223c 1, galaxies present a clear bimodality regarding their SFRs: (a) those that are more actively forming stars [defined broadly as star-forming galaxies (SFGs)], and (b) those that present little or no star-forming activity [defined broadly as passive, quenched, or retired galaxies (RGs); e.g., Stasi\u0144ska et al. (2008)]. These two groups are well separated in different diagrams that compare either the current SFR or proxies of the age of the stellar population with the integrated stellar mass or absolute magnitude, like the SFR versus mass diagram (SFR\u2013M\n\\*, e.g., Renzini & Peng 2015), the color\u2013magnitude diagram (e.g., Bell et al. 2004), or the D4000\u2013mass diagram (e.g., Blanton & Moustakas 2009; where D4000 is an age tracer). In addition, this bimodality is strongly correlated with the morphological, structural, and dynamical properties of the galaxies (e.g., Drory & Fisher 2007, Blanton & Moustakas 2009, Graham et al. 2018). In general, SFGs are late-type galaxies (LTGs) and disk dominated (e.g., Brinchmann et al. 2004), whereas RGs are usually early type and bulge dominated (e.g., Drory & Fisher 2007). Additionally, we know that the masses of early-type galaxies at low redshift have grown by at least a factor of two in the past \u223c8 Gyr (e.g., Bell et al. 2006); however, they show little or no significant SF during the same time period (e.g., L\u00f3pez Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2018, S\u00e1nchez et al. 2019a). This implies that there should be a population of galaxies transitioning from SFGs to RGs. This event may last only a few gigayears, and it involves profound morphological and structural transformation of those galaxies, as well as dramatic aging of their average stellar populations.

However, at the time it was impossible to take into account the magnetized turbulence responsible for the accretion. And, though such alignment was seen in nonrelativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations (e.g., Nelson & Papaloizou 2000), general relativistic magnetized simulations of tilted disks, as thin as h/r = 0.08, have shown no sign of the BP alignment (Zhuravlev et al. 2014). Liska et al.

This remarkable discovery is the first demonstration of BP alignment in a general relativistic numerical simulation of a magnetized accretion disk. Importantly, the duration of these simulations is long enough for the inner regions of the accretion disk to achieve inflow equilibrium and quasi\u2013steady state. The BP alignment was also seen in shorter nonrelativistic simulations that approximated the effects of black hole rotation via additional torques in MHD equations (Hawley & Krolik 2019) and did not include the effects of apsidal precession, which can qualitatively affect the alignment process (Nealon et al. 2016).", "citations": [["Petterson", "1975"], ["Zhuravlev", "2014"], ["Nelson", "Papaloizou", "2000"], ["Krolik", "2019"], ["Nealon", "2016"], ["Hawley", "Krolik", "2019"], ["Papaloizou", "2000"], ["Liska", "2019"], ["Bardeen", "Petterson", "1975"]], "arxiv": ["1905.01165", "1406.5515", "9909486", "1510.02525", "1904.03243"]}, "1805.01142_1": {"title": "Chemodynamical History of the Galactic Bulge", "question": " What evidence led to the confirmation of a barred bulge structure in the Milky Way, and how has this affected our understanding of the Galactic bulge?", "text": "\nDe Vaucouleurs (1964) first suggested a barred Bulge in the MW from the high gas velocities in the central Galaxy.

Modern data have confirmed the Bulge to have a box/peanut (B/P) shape typical for barred galaxies. With star counts at high latitudes, it was discovered that the Bulge has an X-shaped component (McWilliam & Zoccali 2010, Nataf et al. 2010), which is a manifestation of a B/P bulge as later demonstrated by the reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) Bulge density (Wegg & Gerhard 2013) from VVV (Vista Variables in the Via Lactea) data (see \n\nTable 1\n\n).

Typically, the power spectrum of a star with solar-like oscillations (\nFigure 10) shows a regular pattern of modes, characterized by a large frequency separation \u0394\u03bd. The overall amplitude is modulated by a Gaussian envelope, and this is characterized by the frequency of maximum oscillation \u03bdmax. Theory suggests that \u0394\u03bd for a given star is related to its density (Ulrich 1986), whereas the \u03bdmax is related to its surface gravity and temperature (Brown et al. 1991, Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995).

(2012) discussed how a carbonate-silicate cycle could be maintained with up to 95% of a planet's surface covered by water, suggesting by extrapolation a possible CO2 cycling for Type 2 waterworlds via the rocky ocean floor. Such planet models show a varying timescale for a carbon cycle, depending on their initial carbon inventory and temperature (Foley 2015). However, for Type 1 waterworlds, that is, super-Earths with water mass fractions like those of Earth or higher, the deep oceans are separated from the rocky interior via a layer of high-pressure ices. Therefore, an alternative mechanism to modulate abundant gases like CO2 and CH4 would be required in waterworlds. Such a mechanism would depend on the properties of their clathration in water over a range of very high pressures. Under very high pressures (above 0.6 GPa), common to super-Earth-sized water planets, clathrates undergo a phase transition in their structure to a form known as filled ice that can transport CH4 and CO2 (Levi et al. 2013, 2017). This should enable effective cycling of CO2 through the atmosphere and oceans on water planets residing in the HZ (e.g., with water oceans at the surface) and thus provide an alternative atmospheric concentration feedback mechanism to regulate CO2 on water planets. The timescales and effectiveness of such cycling is still an open question (Kitzmann et al. 2015, Levi et al. 2017). A lively debate in the literature addresses how the interiors of such worlds might work, regarding the ability to cycle gases from the rocky core to the atmosphere (Valencia et al. 2007; Grasset et al. 2009; Fu et al. 2010; Rogers & Seager 2010; Kaltenegger et al. 2013; Tackley et al. 2013; Levi et al. 2013, 2017) and whether such planets could be habitats (Abbot 2016, Abbot et al. 2012, Kaltenegger et al. 2013, Noack et al. 2016). First analyses of what atmospheric spectra of waterworlds might look like and whether they could be distinguished from land-dominated worlds even in transit, where surface albedo would not be detectable, depend strongly on whether long-term CO2 cycling can be maintained (Kaltenegger et al. 2013).", "citations": [["Grasset", "2009"], ["Levi", "2017"], ["Abbot", "2016"], ["Tackley", "2013"], ["Rogers", "Seager", "2010"], ["Foley", "2015"], ["Kitzmann", "2015"], ["Fu", "2010"], ["Noack", "2016"], ["Kaltenegger", "2013"], ["Seager", "2010"], ["Valencia", "2007"], ["Levi", "2013"], ["Abbot", "2012"]], "arxiv": ["1209.4098", "1212.2638", "1609.08185", "1208.1760", "1507.01727", "1204.3539", "1205.5034", "1501.07607", "1304.5058", "0912.3288", "1307.0416", "1606.03030", "0902.1640", "1304.4215", "1306.2889", "1005.4037", "1001.2890", "1306.2890", "0704.3454"]}, "2011.13472_2": {"title": "Evolution and Mass Loss of Cool Ageing Stars: a Daedalean Story", "question": " How has ALMA advanced our understanding of wind morphologies in AGB and RSG stars, and what structures have been observed?", "text": "The opening of ALMA in 2012 heralded a leap forward in the understanding of wind morphologies.

These results suggest that among the possible candidates, TiO2 clusters are the only possible dust precursors. However, the kinetic temperature corresponding to the spatial regions where dust is found is roughly 1,500\u20132,000 K (Norris et al. 2012, Khouri et al. 2016), well above the formation temperature of (TiO2)\nN\n = 10, which is around 1,000\u20131,200 K.

These are de Broglie scale, order unity density fluctuations. The fluctuation can take the density all the way to zero (complete destructive interference, i.e., vortices; see Section 3.4). There are different ways to probe these interference substructures. One is through the heating and scattering of stars, already discussed in Section 4.3.2. The other is through gravitational lensing by the substructures. For instance, a de Broglie\u2013sized blob in our own Galaxy passing over the line of sight to some distant object would cause the apparent position of that object to shift (Weiner 2019, Hui et al. 2021, Mishra-Sharma et al. 2020, Mondino et al. 2020).

First of all, the corona is a plasma environment allowing for a thorough study of a fully ionized, magnetically dominated plasma. In particular, MHD waves detected in the corona are possibly the longest MHD and, hence, electromagnetic waves in the Universe, resolved simultaneously in time and space. A highly debated topic is a possible role of MHD waves in the enigmatic problems of heating of the solar and stellar coronae and acceleration of the solar and stellar winds. Waves could carry the energy through different layers of the solar atmosphere and deposit it in the corona by some as-yet-unidentified but intensively investigated dissipative processes (see, e.g., Liu & Ofman 2014, Arregui 2015, Klimchuk 2015, Ofman 2016, Cranmer & Winebarger 2019, for recent reviews). The main question is whether the energy carried by observed waves is sufficient to compensate for the energy losses by optically thin radiation and thermal conduction to the chromosphere (e.g., De Moortel & Browning 2015). In addition, MHD waves could trigger impulsive energy release phenomena of flares and coronal mass ejections (e.g., Nakariakov et al. 2006), and, in particular, produce quasi-periodic modulation of the flaring emission (e.g., Van Doorsselaere et al. 2016). Furthermore, the generation of MHD waves acts as an additional sink of the released magnetic energy. The latter issue is rather natural, as an impulsive and spatially localized energy deposition in an elastic and compressible medium such as the corona should result in the excitation of waves propagating outwardly from the epicenter. MHD waves excited by flares can spread the released energy and the associated heating at a certain distance around the energy release site, in particular, across the field. However, the efficiency of this process needs to be assessed; some evidence of this has been found in observations (Huang et al. 2018). In addition, the waves excited by flares could reach another potentially flaring magnetic structure and trigger the energy release there. It may lead to chains of consecutive flares appearing at different spatial locations, known as sympathetic flares (e.g., Moon et al. 2002), or be responsible for the observed progression of elementary energy releases along the magnetic neutral line in major, two-ribbon flares (Nakariakov & Zimovets 2011). Another rapidly developing research direction is the diagnostics of coronal plasmas by MHD waves, i.e., the method of MHD seismology. As properties of MHD waves depend on properties of the plasma environment that supports them, it becomes possible to use the waves for probing macroscopic parameters of the plasma in the vicinity of the wave propagation region.", "citations": [["Klimchuk", "2015"], ["Nakariakov", "2006"], ["Doorsselaere", "2016"], ["Moon", "2002"], ["Browning", "2015"], ["Cranmer", "Winebarger", "2019"], ["Nakariakov", "Zimovets", "2011"], ["Moortel", "Browning", "2015"], ["Ofman", "2014"], ["Arregui", "2015"], ["Zimovets", "2011"], ["Huang", "2018"], ["Van", "Doorsselaere", "2016"], ["Liu", "Ofman", "2014"], ["Ofman", "2016"], ["Winebarger", "2019"]], "arxiv": ["1510.00977", "1801.05983", "1811.00461", "1410.5660", "1404.0670", "1501.06708"]}, "Magnetohydrodynamic_2": {"title": "Magnetohydrodynamic Waves in the Solar Corona", "question": " How does thermal conductivity affect the damping of slow magnetoacoustic waves in the solar corona, and what other mechanisms may contribute to their dissipation?", "text": "Conventionally, the damping of slow modes is associated with the field-aligned thermal conductivity effect (see, e.g., Ofman & Wang 2002, De Moortel & Hood 2003, Owen et al. 2009). It is considered to be sufficient for the interpretation of observed properties of slow waves both qualitatively and quantitatively in certain physical conditions, i.e., for a specific combination of the equilibrium plasma density and temperature. In other physical conditions, though, it was shown to be less successful (e.g., De Moortel 2009). A parameter controlling the efficiency of the thermal conduction is the conduction time \n\n, where the parallel conductivity coefficient in the Spitzer form is \n\n, and C\n\nV\n = (\u03b3 \u2212 1)\u22121\nk\nB/m\np is the specific heat capacity with k\nB being the Boltzmann constant and m\np the proton mass. The time \u03c4cond is highly sensitive to the equilibrium plasma temperature, T\n0, density, \u03c10, and the characteristic spatial scale, \n\n. The dependence of \u03c4cond on the temperature is shown in \nFigure 1a\n\n for various wavelengths. For illustration, consider a fundamental standing slow mode with the wavelength determined as double the loop length L = 116 Mm. The thermal conduction time is sufficiently longer than typical slow oscillation periods in the range of temperatures from \u223c1 to 5 MK (from a few to a few tens of minutes), which makes the effect of the thermal conduction on the slow wave weak in this temperature range. In a hotter plasma, from \u223c5 to 12 MK, \u03c4cond is roughly comparable with the slow oscillation period, indicating high efficiency of the wave damping by thermal conduction. For temperatures above 12 MK, \u03c4cond becomes substantially shorter than the slow oscillation period, implying that the thermal conduction rapidly smooths out any temperature gradient along the field and thus making the slow wave nearly isothermal. In the lower thermal conduction limit, the conductive damping time of slow waves, \n\n, decreases with temperature down to some value, after which the wave dynamics approaches the isothermal regime and therefore becomes independent of the thermal conductivity (e.g., Porter et al. 1994, Krishna Prasad et al. 2019). The existence of the isothermal regime indicates the importance of additional dissipative mechanisms for slow modes in the corona. It could be viscous damping (Owen et al. 2009, Wang et al. 2018), longitudinal nonuniformity (De Moortel & Hood 2004, Konkol et al. 2010), nonlinear damping (e.g., Verwichte et al. 2008, Ruderman 2013), mode coupling (De Moortel et al. 2004), or damping by the misbalance between coronal heating and radiative cooling processes (Nakariakov et al. 2017, Kolotkov et al. 2019).

This includes kinematic measurements of Hi gas (Kim et al. 1998, Staveley-Smith et al. 2003), star clusters (Grocholski et al. 2006), and stars (Prevot et al. 1985, Kunkel et al. 1997, van der Marel et al. 2002, Massey & Olsen 2003, Olsen & Massey 2007, Olsen et al. 2011).", "citations": [["Prevot", "1985"], ["Kunkel", "1997"], ["Kim", "1998"], ["Olsen", "2003"], ["Olsen", "Massey", "2007"], ["Olsen", "2011"], ["Staveley-Smith", "2003"], ["Marel", "2002"], ["Massey", "2007"], ["Massey", "Olsen", "2003"], ["Grocholski", "2006"]], "arxiv": ["0701500", "0607052", "1106.0044", "0309272", "0210501", "0210615"]}, "Evidence_1": {"title": "Evidence for Initial Mass Function Variation in Massive Early-Type Galaxies", "question": " What physical processes have been proposed to explain the shape of the initial mass function (IMF), and how do observations constrain its environmental dependence?", "text": "To date, there is no complete theoretical understanding of the origin of the whole shape of the IMF, including the characteristic mass of the break or turnover. A wide range of physical processes has been invoked as being responsible for shaping the IMF during star formation, including turbulent fragmentation, magnetic fields, and radiative feedback from massive protostars (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund 2002, Bonnell et al. 2006, Krumholz 2006, Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008, Bate 2009, Hopkins 2012). Some of these conjectures favor an IMF that depends on the environment in which star formation proceeds: e.g., those where the characteristic mass scale is set by the Jeans mass (or its equivalent in turbulent models), which in turn depends on the ambient density, temperature, etc. Extensive efforts to measure the IMF in different star-forming regions in the MW have not found compelling evidence for systematic dependence on such properties (e.g., Bastian et al. 2010), although localized deviations from the standard form do seem to be present in a few regions (e.g., Luhman 2004, Lu et al. 2013). Hence much of the theoretical modeling effort cited above was aimed at accounting for the apparent near-universality of the IMF.", "citations": [["Padoan", "Nordlund", "2002"], ["Bastian", "2010"], ["Lu", "2013"], ["Krumholz", "2006"], ["Hennebelle", "Chabrier", "2008"], ["Bate", "2009"], ["Chabrier", "2008"], ["Luhman", "2004"], ["Bonnell", "2006"], ["Hopkins", "2012"], ["Nordlund", "2002"]], "arxiv": ["0011465", "1001.2965", "1301.0540", "0608471", "0805.0691", "0811.0163", "0411447", "0603444", "1110.4638"]}, "Evidence_2": {"title": "Evidence for Initial Mass Function Variation in Massive Early-Type Galaxies", "question": " How do strong gravitational lensing measurements of low-redshift elliptical galaxies constrain their stellar initial mass functions?", "text": "For many years, the only known low-redshift strong-lens system was Q2237+0305, the Einstein Cross (Huchra et al. 1985). In this case, the lensing galaxy is a barred spiral with \u03c3 \u2248 165 km s\u22121, at z = 0.038, and analysis yields a total Einstein-aperture M/L that is too small to be consistent with a Salpeter or heavier IMF (Ferreras et al. 2010), even assuming no contribution from DM. Smith et al. (2005) discovered the first low-redshift elliptical galaxy known to act as a strong lens. ESO325\u2013G004, at z = 0.034, images a background galaxy into a partial Einstein ring, providing a very robust measurement of the mass projected inside a radius of 1.9 kpc (\u223c0.25 R\neff). With a high velocity dispersion (\u03c3 \u223c300 km s\u22121), absence of any apparent ongoing star formation, negligible rotation, and \u03b1-enhanced abundance pattern, this galaxy is typical of the objects found in other studies to have a (bottom-)heavy IMF. However, Smith & Lucey (2013) showed that the lensing mass implies \u03a8 to be consistent with a MW IMF (\u03b1lens = 1.04 \u00b1 0.15). They assumed a theoretically motivated estimate for the projected DM contribution, but this is a small correction (15%) due to the small projected Einstein radius, and even attributing all mass to the stars yields a sub-Salpeter \u03b1 factor. Three further low-z early-type lens galaxies have since been discovered (Smith et al. 2015, Collier et al. 2018). After corrections for the likely projected DM content, based on cosmological simulations, all of these galaxies have \u03b1 consistent with a MW IMF, on \u223c2-kpc scales. Efforts are underway to enlarge the samples of low-redshift strong lenses (Talbot et al. 2018, Collier et al. 2020). The approach can be augmented with upper limits on \u03b1 from galaxies with close-projected but singly imaged background galaxies, when unambiguous limits on counter-images can be established (Smith et al. 2018).", "citations": [["Collier", "2018"], ["Smith", "2018"], ["However", "Smith", "Lucey", "2013"], ["Smith", "2015"], ["Ferreras", "2010"], ["Smith", "2005"], ["Lucey", "2013"], ["Talbot", "2018"], ["Collier", "2020"], ["Huchra", "1985"], ["Smith", "Lucey", "2013"]], "arxiv": ["1803.07082", "1808.08235", "1805.05964", "1806.08300", "1509.01253", "1503.02661", "1008.4363", "0504453", "1306.4983", "1803.03604", "2002.07191"]}, "Evidence_3": {"title": "Evidence for Initial Mass Function Variation in Massive Early-Type Galaxies", "question": " How does the two-phase formation scenario for massive early-type galaxies potentially explain observed radial variations in their initial mass functions?", "text": "CONNECTION TO THE TWO-PHASE GALAXY FORMATION SCENARIOEvidence from both observations and simulations seems to support a two-phase scenario for the formation of massive ETGs (Oser et al. 2010). In this picture, an early phase of in situ star formation (Barro et al. 2013) leads to a population of initially compact (1\u20132 kpc) but massive (\u223c1011 M\u2299) quiescent galaxies at z\n\n\n 1.5 (Trujillo et al. 2006), which later grow by accreting stars that formed elsewhere, through minor mergers (Belli et al. 2014). The similarity in size-scale with the radial extent of the IMF variations in massive ETGs (\n\n2 kpc, e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2017, La Barbera et al. 2019) tempts speculation that the IMF signal is linked specifically to the surviving stars from the in situ formation phase, which are thought still to dominate the innermost regions (<0.1 R\neff) of their descendent galaxies at z = 0 (e.g., Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016).
