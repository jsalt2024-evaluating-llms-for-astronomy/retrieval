       "   'question': ' How has the UV luminosity function of galaxies evolved from z~4 to z~8 according to analyses of deep HST data?',\n",
       "   'text': 'Early analyses of the GOODS data (Giavalisco et al. 2004a) found evidence for relatively mild evolution of the UV luminosity density from 2 < z < 5 and clear evidence that there were fewer high-luminosity galaxies at z≈6 (Stanway et al. 2003, Dickinson et al. 2004). Subsequent studies have repeatedly mined the combined GOODS+HUDF observations, using deeper data and more rigorous analyses. At least 20 papers about high-redshift LFs using WFC3 data in the HUDF and GOODS/CANDELS have been published since 2010, augmenting at least a dozen others pre-WFC3. We cannot attempt to review them all here, but they have convincingly demonstrated that the UVLF evolves significantly at z>4. The current consensus is that this is primarily luminosity evolution, at least at 4 < z < 7, with L∗ brightening over time (e.g., Bouwens et al. 2007, 2012b; Grazian et al. 2011). As a result, the number density of bright LBGs increases rapidly with time, more quickly than does the integrated luminosity density. Analyses using the CANDELS and HUDF09+12 NIR imaging point to continued evolution out to z = 8 and perhaps beyond (Oesch et al. 2012, Yan et al. 2012, Lorenzoni et al. 2013, Schenker et al. 2013), although it would be prudent to recall that only a handful of galaxies at z≈7 have reasonably secure spectroscopic confirmation and none at z>7.5. There is broad agreement that UV spectral slopes for LBGs are bluer at z>4 than at lower redshifts (Bouwens et al. 2012a, Finkelstein et al. 2012a, Dunlop et al. 2013), which has implications for their dust extinction and total SFRD. Most of these studies have examined the faint-end slope of the LF, measuring very steep values, in some cases approaching or exceeding the divergent value α=−2 (Bouwens et al. 2012b, McLure et al. 2013). Several studies have also extended SFRD analyses to 9 < z < 12, using data from the HUDF (Bouwens et al. 2011a, Ellis et al. 2013) or from lensing cluster studies (Coe et al. 2013). Although still in flux as better data accumulate, these measurements have considerable significance for the earliest phases of galaxy evolution and for the reionization of the IGM (e.g., Robertson et al. 2013), but relatively little impact on the global star-formation budget of the Universe. According to current estimates, only ∼1% of the cosmic SMD present today was formed at z>6.',\n",

       "   'question': ' How does the specific star formation rate of galaxies evolve with redshift and stellar mass, and what are the implications for galaxy growth and the cosmic star formation history?',\n",
       "   'text': 'In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the sSFR (sSFR≡SFR/M∗) of galaxies with different masses at different times in the history of the Universe. The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M∗, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M∗ correlation. For the “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a “downsizing” picture first introduced by Cowie et al. (1996). Dwarf galaxies continue to undergo major episodes of activity. The tightness of this SFR-M∗ correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH. Starburst galaxies, whose SFRs are significantly elevated above the main-sequence correlation, contribute only a small fraction of the global SFRD at z⩽2 (Rodighiero et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2012). Instead, the evolution of the cosmic SFR is primarily due to the steadily evolving properties of main-sequence disk galaxies.',\n",

In contrast to observations, they provide for controlled environments in which physical properties, histories, and futures of gas are all known and can be manipulated to tease insights out of the otherwise unmanageable complexity of a multiphase gaseous medium. As reviewed by Somerville et al. (2015), there are many schemes for simulating the development of the cosmic web and galaxies under the influence of dark matter, gravity, and hydrodynamics. The major methods at present are smoothed particle hydrodynamics, such as Gadget (Ford et al. 2013, Oppenheimer et al. 2016), Gasoline (Christensen et al. 2016, Gutcke et al. 2017), and GIZMO (Muratov et al. 2017); adaptive mesh refinement, such as Enzo (Hummels et al. 2013, Corlies & Schiminovich 2016); and moving mesh (Arepo and the Illustris simulation; Suresh et al. 2017). Large-scale cosmological simulations in megaparsec-scale boxes can simulate hundreds of galaxies in their proper ΛCDM contexts (e.g., Oppenheimer & Davé 2006, Ford et al. 2014, Vogelsberger et al. 2014). At the opposite end of the scale, very high-resolution simulations focused on the interaction between dense clouds and diffuse halos (e.g., Heitsch & Putman 2009, Armillotta et al. 2016) that can reach scales at much less than a parsec. Spanning these two regimes are the so-called zoom simulations, which resolve enough of the large-scale structure to accurately trace a single galaxy or a subset of galaxies selected out of larger boxes (\\nFigure 3\\n; Schaye et al. 2015). Even zooms must make assumptions about physics that they do not resolve, using “sub-grid” prescriptions to stand in for such complex phenomena as star formation, metal mixing and transport, supernova and AGN feedback, and others. Sub-grid models are parameterized and tuned to yield specific metrics—like the stellar mass function at z=0—and then the properties that emerge—such as SFRs, morphology, quenching, and the CGM—are analyzed and compared with data to constrain the physical prescriptions that went in. We use simulations from a broad range of techniques and groups to look for insights into how the CGM participates in galaxy evolution and to help interpret data.',\n",

Indirect evidence for a hot phase comes from highly ionized metals that correlate with the low-ionization HVCs (Sembach et al. 2003, Fox et al. 2006, Lehner et al. 2009, Wakker et al. 2012), suggesting boundary layers between a hot medium and the colder HVCs. MW HVCs also show head–tail morphologies indicative of cool clouds moving through a hot medium (e.g., Brüns et al. 2000). Finally, the multiphase CGM is clearly manifested in hydrodynamic simulations, which exhibit a mixture of cool (104 K) and warm–hot (105.5–106 K) gas within a galaxy virial radius with a density profile that drops with increased distance from the central host galaxy (e.g., Stinson et al. 2012, Ford et al. 2013, Shen et al. 2013, Suresh et al. 2017; \\nFigure 3\\n).

       "   'text': \"The Galactic Corona began with Spitzer's insight that cold clouds could be confined by a hot surrounding medium. This model has matured over the years into a strong line of theoretical research focused on the detailed physics of how the thermal, hydrodynamic, and ionization states of CGM gas evolve in dark matter halos. Placing multiphase gas into the context of the dark matter halo, Maller & Bullock (2004) suggested cold clouds cooled out of thermal instabilities in a hot medium while maintaining rough pressure equilibrium [though see Binney et al. (2009) for a counterpoint]. Accretion may also be seeded by gas ejected from the disk, as in the galactic fountain or precipitation model (e.g., Fraternali & Binney 2008, Voit et al. 2015b). These scenarios start with very simple assumptions—such as hydrostatic hot halos, diffuse clouds in PIE, or particular radial entropy profiles. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because we do not know the large-scale physical state of the CGM as a whole. Photoionization modeling of the low-ionization CGM using only the EUVB (Haardt & Madau 2001) strongly disfavors hydrostatic equilibrium with hot gas at T\\nvir (Werk et al. 2014); the cool and hot phases appear to have similar densities, rather than similar pressures. Furthermore, if Ovi-traced gas follows a hydrostatic profile at the temperature where its ionization fraction peaks, T ∼105.5 K, then its column density profile would be significantly steeper than observed (Tumlinson et al. 2011). There may be other means of supporting this gas, such as turbulence (Fielding et al. 2017), cosmic rays (Salem et al. 2016), or magnetic fields.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Is the disk maximal? As shown with the illustrative models in \\nFigure 16\\n, the answer to this question largely depends on the disk (mass) scale length. These models include a bulge with dynamical mass fitted to the BRAVA kinematic data and stellar mass corresponding to a Kroupa IMF with ±10% margins (Portail et al. 2015b). The disk has local stellar surface density of \\n\\n (Bovy & Rix 2013) and scale lengths R\\nd=2.15kpc (Bissantz & Gerhard 2002, Bovy & Rix 2013), 2.6kpc (Robin et al. 2003, Jurić et al. 2008), and 3.0kpc (Kent et al. 1991, Gould et al. 1996) and includes a gas disk with surface density of \\n\\n and twice the stellar scale length. A short scale length R\\nd has important implications: The Galaxy's disk (summed over all stellar and gaseous components) is then maximal (Sackett 1997) in the sense that the disk and bulge dominate the rotation curve, i.e., contribute 85% of the rotational velocity and ∼70% of the rotational support at 2.2R\\nd. We included the bulge in the definition here because it mostly originates from the disk (Section 4.2). For the three scale lengths shown, the baryonic component provides a median fraction fv\\n= (86%, 73%, 65%) of the circular velocity and (74%, 53%, 42%) of the radial force at 2.2R\\nd. Thus the Milky Way's disk is maximal only for the shortest scale length (see also Sackett 1997, Gerhard 1999, Bovy & Rix 2013, Piffl et al. 2014a), but even for the longer R\\nd its contribution to the rotational velocity is at the upper limit of that inferred for typical spiral galaxies by Martinsson et al. (2013, fv\\n=0.4–0.7; but see Aniyan et al. 2016).\",\n",

       "   'text': 'In principle, the mapping between the initial spectrum of density fluctuations at z→∞ and the mass spectrum of collapsed (virialized) DM halos at later times could be extremely complicated: As a given scale becomes nonlinear, it could affect the collapse of nearby regions or regions on larger scales. In practice, however, the mass spectrum of DM halos can be modeled remarkably well with a few simple assumptions. The first detailed model was proposed by Press & Schechter (1974); they assumed that the mass spectrum of collapsed objects could be calculated by extrapolating the overdensity field using linear theory even into the highly nonlinear regime and using a spherical collapse model (Gunn & Gott 1972). In the Press–Schechter model, the DM halo mass function—the abundance of DM halos per unit mass per unit volume at redshift z, often written as dn(M, z)/dM—depends only on the root-mean-square amplitude of the linear DM power spectrum, smoothed using a spherical top-hat filter in real space and extrapolated to redshift z using linear theory. Subsequent work has put this formalism on more rigorous mathematical footing (Bond et al. 1991, Cole 1991, Sheth et al. 2001), and this extended Press–Schechter (EPS) theory yields abundances of DM halos that are perhaps surprisingly accurate [see Zentner (2007) for a comprehensive review of EPS theory]. This accuracy is tested through comparisons with large-scale numerical simulations.',\n",

       "   'text': 'As discussed in Section 1, ΛCDM simulations that include only DM predict that DM halos should have density profiles that rise steeply at small radius ρ(r)∝r\\n−γ, with γ≃0.8–1.4 over the radii of interest for small galaxies (Navarro et al. 2010). This is in contrast to many (though not all) low-mass DM-dominated galaxies with well-measured rotation curves, which prefer fits with constant-density cores (γ≈0−0.5; e.g., McGaugh et al. 2001, Marchesini et al. 2002, Simon et al. 2005, de Blok et al. 2008, Kuzio de Naray et al. 2008; see also Walker & Peñarrubia 2011). A related issue is that fiducial ΛCDM simulations predict more DM in the central regions of galaxies than is measured for the galaxies that they should host according to AM. This central density problem is an issue of normalization and exists independent of the precise slope of the central density profile (Alam et al. 2002, Oman et al. 2015). Although these problems are in principle distinct issues, as the second refers to a tension in total cumulative mass and the first is an issue with the derivative, it is likely that they point to a common tension. DM-only ΛCDM halos are too dense and too cuspy in their centers compared with many observed galaxies.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Many of the most advanced hydrodynamic simulations today have shown that it is possible for baryonic feedback to erase the central cusps shown in the density profiles in \\nFigure 4\\n and produce core-like density profiles as inferred from rotation curves such as those shown in \\nFigure 9\\n (Mashchenko et al. 2008, Pontzen & Governato 2012, Madau et al. 2014, Oñorbe et al. 2015, Read et al. 2016). One key prediction is that the effect of core creation will vary with the mass in stars formed (Governato et al. 2012, Di Cintio et al. 2014). If galaxies form enough stars, there will be enough energy from supernovae to redistribute DM and create significant cores. If too many baryons end up in stars, however, the excess central mass can compensate and drag DM back in. At the other extreme, if too few stars are formed, there will not be enough energy in supernovae to alter halo density structure, and the resultant DM distribution will resemble DM-only simulations. Although the possible importance of supernova-driven blowouts for the central DM structure of dwarf galaxies was already appreciated by Navarro et al. (1996) and Gnedin & Zhao (2002), an important recent development is the understanding that even low-level star formation over an extended period can drive gravitational potential fluctuations that lead to DM core formation.',\n",

       "   'text': 'We know that black holes are made in the deaths of massive stars. This process happens at the present day, but at early times we expect theoretically that the first (so-called Pop III) stars were quite massive, due to the inability of molecular hydrogen gas to cool (Bromm & Larson 2004, Karlsson et al. 2013, and references therein). Such massive stars would likely end their lives as black holes with M\\nBH ∼ 100 M⊙ (e.g., Fryer et al. 2001), excepting first stars in the mass range of 140–260 M⊙ that would explode as pair-instability supernovae and leave no remnant (Heger et al. 2003). As shown by Madau & Rees (2001), if these first massive stars are rare, such that only about one is made in each high-density peak at very high redshift, then the number density of black holes would be well matched to the number of supermassive black holes today. However, growing from ∼100 M⊙ to a billion Suns in a fraction of a gigayear requires dramatic fueling (Haiman & Loeb 2001). Specifically, for a typical e-folding time of 45 million years, 14 such e-foldings are available at z = 7, but 17 are needed if the black hole grows at the Eddington limit (Madau et al. 2014, and references therein). Arranging this uninterrupted growth seems challenging even for these rare quasars (e.g., Johnson & Bromm 2007, Milosavljević et al. 2009). However, a few episodes of super-Eddington accretion could largely alleviate the tension, and super-Eddington accretion now appears to arise naturally in numerical experiments (e.g., Jiang et al. 2019).',\n",

       "   'text': 'A different channel, with no local analogs, is that of collapsing gas clouds forming a massive seed black hole without passing through all the phases of stellar evolution. These direct-collapse models form seed black holes with M\\nBH ∼ 104–106 M⊙ (e.g., Loeb & Rasio 1994, Bromm & Loeb 2003, Begelman et al. 2006, Lodato & Natarajan 2006), which perhaps pass through a quasi-star phase (e.g., Begelman 2010). This channel can only operate at very high redshift, because pristine gas is required to suppress cooling and fragmentation. Recent literature discusses in detail how rare the conditions may be to ensure that the gas does not cool and fragment into smaller units (e.g., Visbal et al. 2014, Habouzit et al. 2016), typically assuming that an elevated Lyman–Werner background is needed (e.g., Omukai 2001). Some works instead argue that additional photons from star formation in nearby halos (e.g., Dijkstra et al. 2008, Visbal et al. 2014), additional gas heating through mergers (Yoshida et al. 2003, Wise et al. 2019), or even star formation within individual halos (Dunn et al. 2018), may provide sufficient heating or ionizing photons to make this channel viable. We emphasize that the number density of halos that suffer direct collapse is very uncertain, with predictions differing on the halo gas accretion rates as a function of mass, the required elevation of the ionizing background, and the possible sources of ionizing photons.

       "   'text': 'Dynamical modeling of supermassive black holes has a long history and has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995, Kormendy & Ho 2013). The kinematics can be measured from either stars or gas in the vicinity of the black hole. For stellar-dynamical modeling, state-of-the-art codes use Schwarzschild modeling (Schwarzschild 1979) to jointly model the mass density of the central black hole, stars, and dark matter by orbit superposition (e.g., Rix et al. 1997, Gebhardt et al. 2003). The stellar-mass profile is modeled from the light, which is then converted to a mass profile by solving for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and if needed a dark matter halo component is also independently fitted (e.g., Gebhardt & Thomas 2009). The orbit families are weighted to match the spatially resolved stellar kinematical measurements. A major issue for all dynamical models is distinguishing between orbital anisotropy and mass (e.g., a black hole). This mass–anisotropy degeneracy is well known (e.g., Binney & Mamon 1982). Other (related) issues include: (a) degeneracy between the stellar M/L and the black hole mass, (b) incomplete stellar orbit libraries, and (c) the assumption of axisymmetry (van den Bosch & de Zeeuw 2010). The systematic uncertainties for black hole masses from gas dynamics are qualitatively different than they are for stellar dynamics, but given the large systematics for both kinds of analysis, we use them interchangeably in our discussion (although see a more complete discussion in Walsh et al. 2013).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Black hole accretion is a fundamental physical process in the universe and is the primary power source behind active galactic nuclei (AGNs), black hole binaries (BHBs), and, possibly, gamma-ray bursts. The first genuine model of an accretion disk—by which we mean a rotating flow with viscous transport of angular momentum—is the celebrated thin disk model developed in the early 1970s (Novikov & Thorne 1973, Shakura & Sunyaev 1973, Lynden-Bell & Pringle 1974; see reviews by Pringle 1981, Frank et al. 2002, Kato et al. 2008, Abramowicz & Fragile 2013, Blaes 2013). Depending on the mass of the central black hole, the gas temperature in this model lies in the range 104–107 K, which is quite cold relative to the virial temperature. The disk is geometrically thin, whereas the gas is optically thick and radiates thermal blackbody-like radiation. Many accreting black hole sources have been successfully modeled as thin disks, e.g., luminous AGNs (see reviews above; but also Koratkar & Blaes 1999) and BHBs in the thermal state (Remillard & McClintock 2006, McClintock et al. 2013).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Early papers (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Blandford & Begelman 1999) conjectured that hot accretion flows should have strong winds and, by extension, jets. Observational evidence for such an association has accumulated in recent years, with the recognition that essentially all LLAGNs are radio loud (Falcke et al. 2000, Nagar et al. 2000, Ho 2002) and the parallel discovery that virtually every BHB in a hard state has radio emission (Corbel et al. 2000; Fender 2001, 2006; Fender et al. 2004). Because all these systems may have hot accretion flows (Section 4.2), a direct causal connection between hot flows and radio-emitting jets seems likely. In contrast, jets are much weaker and are often not seen in systems that have cool geometrically thin disks. Although there is no definitive explanation for this dichotomy, three effects likely play a role: (a) Compared with thin disks, geometrically thick disks more easily advect the magnetic field to the black hole (Livio et al. 1999, Guilet & Ogilvie 2012); (b) the Bernoulli parameter of the gas in hot accretion flows is larger, hence enhancing winds in these systems (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Blandford & Begelman 1999); and (c) strong winds help to collimate and stabilize the jet (Appl & Camenzind 1992, 1993; Beskin & Malyshkin 2000).',\n",

In long-term monitoring designed to measure the source's braking index, Gavriil et al. (2008) detected a sudden X-ray outburst lasting ∼6 weeks and of total energy ∼3×1041 ergs in the 2–10-keV band (see also Kumar & Safi-Harb 2008). The outburst also included several short magnetar-like bursts and a large glitch with unusual recovery (Kuiper & Hermsen 2009, Livingstone et al. 2010). Post-outburst, the source has returned to its quiescent, apparently rotation-powered state, albeit with enhanced timing noise and a significant change in braking index, from 2.65±0.01 pre-outburst to 2.19±0.03 post-outburst (Livingstone et al. 2011, Archibald et al. 2015a). A second such metamorphosis was seen very recently in PSR J1119−6127, a bona fide radio pulsar, also very young (age <2 kyr) and apparently high-B (4×1013 G). In this case the outburst was heralded by bright, magnetar-like X-ray bursts (Göğüş et al. 2016, Kennea et al. 2016, Younes et al. 2016). Follow-up X-ray observations (Archibald et al. 2016a) showed an increase in X-ray flux of nearly a factor of 200 with a dramatic spectral hardening. This outburst was also accompanied by a large glitch (Archibald et al. 2016a) and, remarkably, by a temporary cessation of radio emission (Burgay et al. 2016).\",\n",

All four are transient magnetars, and their radio emission is transient too and associated with an X-ray outburst. In XTE J1810−197 (the first detected radio-emitting magnetar), pulsations were observed after, but not before, its 2003 outburst. The radio pulsations disappeared in late 2008 with no prior secular decrease in radio flux (Camilo et al. 2016). Behavior in the other sources is similar (Camilo et al. 2007a, Levin et al. 2012). The persistent (i.e., nontransient) magnetars and several other transient magnetars have been searched for radio pulsations but with no detections (e.g., Lazarus et al. 2012, Tong et al. 2013b). In the four magnetars with confirmed radio pulsations, the radio emission in all cases is very bright and shows large pulse-to-pulse variability, with pulse morphologies, both single and average, that can be broad and that generally change enormously on timescales of minutes. They can be punctuated by spiky peaks that can be much shorter than the pulse period. This radio emission is also highly linearly polarized, with polarization fractions of 60–100%. No evidence for a radio burst at the epoch of a GF has been seen (Tendulkar et al. 2016).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Over the past three decades, two large self-consistent photoionization codes emerged that include the physical developments discussed above: MAPPINGS (Binette et al. 1985; Sutherland & Dopita 1993, 2017) and CLOUDY (Ferland et al. 1998, 2017). MAPPINGS includes self-consistent treatment of nebular, dust, and shock physics and can be applied to Hii regions, AGNs, and regions shocked by supernovae, galactic winds, and jets. CLOUDY includes self-consistent treatment of nebular, dust, and molecular physics and can be applied to Hii regions, AGNs, and photodissociation regions (PDRs). These photoionization models were originally used as stand-alone codes with blackbody and power-law radiation fields to simulate regions excited by star formation and AGNs, respectively. It is now known that a blackbody does not provide an accurate representation of the ionizing radiation field from a star-forming region because the stellar radiation field is transported through the stellar atmosphere. The helium and metals in the photosphere systematically absorb radiation from the star (known as line blanketing), significantly altering the spectral shape (Pauldrach et al. 2001). Stellar mass loss and rotation, and the effect of binary stars, can also alter the shape of the ionizing radiation field (Kurucz 1979; Pauldrach et al. 1986, 2012; Schmutz et al. 1989; Leitherer 2008; de Mink et al. 2009; Eldridge & Stanway 2012; Levesque et al. 2012).',\n",

Recently, samples of tens of thousands of nearby mid-IR-detected AGNs covering large areas of the sky have been constructed by cross-correlating sources detected by the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE; Wright et al. 2010) with the SDSS (Donoso et al. 2012, Shao et al. 2013). X-ray data having the depth and wide-field sky coverage to fully exploit the SDSS galaxy sample do not exist.

       "   'text': \"The signature of an obscured AGN in the IR is unusually strong mid-IR (∼3- to 30-μm) emission produced by the dusty obscuring structure. The Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) pioneered the detection and characterization of the local AGN populations in the mid- and far-IR (e.g., Miley et al. 1985, Spinoglio & Malkan 1989). Unfortunately, the sensitivity of IRAS was not well matched to the bulk of the optically selected local AGNs in the SDSS (e.g., Pasquali et al. 2005). The Spitzer Space Telescope was considerably more sensitive than IRAS, but it did not undertake wide-field surveys optimized to the local AGN population. Nonetheless, a number of different techniques based on near- and mid-IR color selection were developed to find AGNs using Spitzer data (e.g., Lacy et al. 2004, Stern et al. 2005, Richards et al. 2006, Donley et al. 2008). The situation has been revolutionized with the completion of the mission of NASA's WISE, which has detected near- and mid-IR emission from roughly 30,000 optically classified AGNs in the SDSS main galaxy sample (Donoso et al. 2012, Shao et al. 2013) and many other AGNs as well (e.g., Stern et al. 2012, Rosario et al. 2013). It is important to note here that though samples of AGNs selected by their optical emission lines, their mid-IR emission, or their hard X-ray emission are roughly similar to one another in terms of both the properties of the AGNs and the host galaxies (e.g., Kauffmann et al. 2003a, LaMassa et al. 2010, Winter et al. 2010, Shao et al. 2013), they may not be identical (e.g., Hickox et al. 2009, Koss et al. 2011, Juneau et al. 2013).\",\n",

Woo et al.

In terms of applicability to the SDSS, note that the SDSS spectra can only reliably measure stellar velocity dispersions above σ∼70 km s−1, corresponding to BH masses larger than of order 106M⊙ (depending on which version of M-σ is adopted). A complementary probe of lower-mass SMBHs in the SDSS is provided by using mass estimates based on the broad emission-line width for Type 1 AGNs (Greene & Ho 2007b, Dong et al. 2012, Kormendy & Ho 2013).',\n",

However, after the identification of Sextans by Irwin et al. (1990), the push to ever lower luminosities and surface brightnesses stalled for more than a decade. New efforts to find faint, low surface brightness Milky Way dwarf galaxies continued fruitlessly in this period (Kleyna et al. 1997, Simon & Blitz 2002, Willman et al. 2002, Hopp et al. 2003, Whiting et al. 2007).

       "   'text': 'A reasonable astronomer might ask how the smallest, most inconspicuous galaxies ever formed could have broad importance to the field of astrophysics. Several aspects of the UFDs make them critical objects to understand, with potentially wide-ranging implications. First, UFDs reside in the smallest dark matter halos yet found. Although only the mass at the very center of the halo is currently measurable, the extrapolated virial masses of UFDs are ∼109 M\\n\\n (e.g., Strigari et al. 2008), and the halo masses at the time when the stars formed may have been ∼108 M\\n\\n (e.g., Bovill & Ricotti 2009, Safarzadeh et al. 2018). UFDs are also the most dark matter–dominated systems known. This combination of small halo mass and negligible baryonic mass makes UFDs extremely valuable laboratories for constraining the nature of dark matter. Simply counting the number of such objects around the Milky Way places a limit on the mass of the dark matter particle (e.g., Jethwa et al. 2018). The census and observed mass function of low-mass halos point the direction toward solving the long-standing and highly contentious missing satellite problem (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999, Moore et al. 1999, Simon & Geha 2007, Brooks et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2018). The measured central densities, and perhaps eventually the density profiles, of UFDs provide significant clues to the behavior of dark matter on small scales (e.g., Calabrese & Spergel 2016, Bozek et al. 2019, Errani et al. 2018).',\n",

(2014) studied emission line ratios in a series of UV lines and found no evidence of evolution from lower-redshift samples, with the gas metallicity being a few times solar based on photoionization modeling. This is confirmed by studies using high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectroscopy from the XQR30 survey (\\nhttps://xqr30.inaf.it/\\n) of quasars at z = 5.8–7.5 (Lai et al. 2022). The line ratio of Feii/\\n\\n is of particular interest because of the different enrichment histories of these two lines: Mg is an α element predominantly produced by core-collapse supernovae, whereas Fe is mainly from type-1a supernovae with an evolutionary lifetime delay of a few hundred million years to 1 Gyr. The evolution of the Fe/Mg ratio in quasars has been studied extensively (e.g., Barth et al. 2003, Iwamuro et al. 2004, De Rosa et al. 2014, Mazzucchelli et al. 2017b, Shen et al. 2019, Yang et al. 2021).

The lack of spectral evolution in quasar rest-frame UV spectra, especially in the emission line properties, indicates that quasar BLRs are chemically enriched very rapidly, within the first few hundred million years after the initial star formation in the host galaxy.

       "   'text': '\\nWang et al. (2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts at z ∼ 6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40 deg and R = 2.5kpc, they found that the z ∼ 6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor of 15 more massive than expected from the local BH–bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high-redshift quasars either got a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M–σ relation existed at z ∼ 6, then it would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused on the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang et al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle and/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful dynamic modeling of their \\n\\n observations (including inclination and size). They found a mean dynamical mass of ∼5 × 1010 M⊙ for a sample of luminous z ∼ 6 quasars with ∼109 M⊙ BHs. As shown in \\nFigure 10\\n, this places them about one order of magnitude above the local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly affected by potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Volonteri & Stark 2011, Huang et al. 2018). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower \\n\\n line width (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation.\\n',\n",

Furthermore, improved receiver sensitivities and larger bandwidth, together with multibeaming, increase the general sensitivity to all sorts of pulsars, as in the case of the phenomenally successful Parkes multibeam (PMB) surveys (Manchester et al. 2001). Since then, the newer generation of post-PMB surveys like the new HTRU-South (Keith et al. 2010) and North surveys (Barr et al. 2013), the Green Bank drift scan survey (Boyles et al. 2013, Lynch et al. 2013), the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey (Stovall et al. 2014), the Arecibo ALFA survey (Cordes et al. 2006, Lazarus 2013), and the Arecibo 327-MHz drift-scan survey (Deneva et al. 2013) has been making full use of much improved data-handling capabilities and processing power to obtain a large increase in spectral and time resolution (at a cost of 100 times the data rate).

The predictions span a wide range, from no detectable events in the most pessimistic case up to several tens of events per year per unit redshift at z = 10, and a few events per year even at \\n\\n in the most optimistic models (for recent predictions see, e.g., Klein et al. 2016, Hartwig et al. 2018a, Ricarte & Natarajan 2018; for earlier studies that included the \\n\\n Universe see, e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Tanaka & Haiman 2009 and references therein). The most pessimistic scenario is for stellar-mass BHs to stay below LISA's detection threshold and for massive seed BHs to form inefficiently or to be unable to promptly merge when their hosts merge. The largest rates arise when abundant stellar-mass BH seeds are assumed to grow above LISA's \\n\\n103–4 M⊙ detection threshold by z ∼ 10 or in models in which massive seeds are assumed to form efficiently in a large fraction of ACHs. Aside from the total event rates, the mass spectrum is expected to depend on the seeding and should help disentangle models. LISA data can indeed distinguish between a wide variety of models that include different prescriptions for seed formation, feedback, accretion efficiency, and accretion geometry (Sesana et al. 2011). LISA may also be able to probe SMS star formation itself by measuring mergers of the remnants of binary SMSs (Hartwig et al. 2018a) or directly detecting their formation process, via either the burst accompanying the collapse of a rotating SMS into a single massive BH (Saijo & Hawke 2009, Shibata et al. 2016) or the breakup of such an SMS producing two massive BHs, which subsequently inspiral and merge (Reisswig et al. 2013).\",\n",

The LyC flux of an object can be measured via photometry or spectroscopy blueward of λ = 912 Å. The potential of interlopers means that high-resolution imagery, such as that provided by HST, is a key component of LyC direct detection campaigns. HST provides the ability to resolve nearly coincident interlopers using nonionizing flux (Mostardi et al. 2015, Shapley et al. 2016, Pahl et al. 2021) and to assess directly the LyC with reduced fear of contamination (Siana et al. 2015, Vasei et al. 2016, Rutkowski et al. 2017, Fletcher et al. 2019). Ground-based imaging in U-band or similar filters remains an attractive approach for constraining LyC at high-redshift, given their acceptable efficiency and availability on large telescopes (Guaita et al. 2016, Naidu et al. 2018, Meštrić et al. 2020). Imaging redshifted LyC also benefits from spectroscopic redshifts by preventing nonionizing photons from a source at an uncertain distance from contaminating the inference of escaping ionizing flux or at least quantifying the degree of contamination. Given the large intrinsic ratio of nonionizing to ionizing flux in the rest-frame UV spectra of these galaxies, and the small expected escape fractions, even a small amount of nonionizing flux mistaken as LyC can render conclusions about f\\nesc unreliable. Spectroscopic determinations do not suffer from this uncertainty, but LyC campaigns with ground-based slit spectrographs are in principle not immune to foreground contamination. Perhaps a bigger practical challenge is conducting large campaigns with blue-sensitive spectrographs, which involves either the HST Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) at low redshift (Izotov et al. 2016a,b, 2018) or significant investment with instruments like VLT/VIMOS (VIsible Multi-Object Spectrograph) (de Barros et al. 2016; Marchi et al. 2017, 2018) or Keck/LRIS (Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) (Shapley et al. 2016, Steidel et al. 2018).

       "   'question': ' How has spectroscopic confirmation of high-redshift galaxies progressed, particularly for redshifts z > 7?',\n",
       "   'text': 'Redshifted Lyα remains a mainstay for high-redshift spectroscopic confirmations. A small population of galaxies with redshifts 7.5 ≳ z ≳ 8 have been confirmed, often selected from HST CANDELS imaging. These include an early discovery of Lyα emission at z = 7.51 (Finkelstein et al. 2013), which also has a grism continuum measurement of the Lyman break (Tilvi et al. 2016). Over the next few years, this object was followed by a range of Lyα emitters spectroscopically confirmed at z = 7.45–8 (Oesch et al. 2015, Roberts-Borsani et al. 2016, Song et al. 2016b, Hoag et al. 2017, Stark et al. 2017, Larson et al. 2018, Jung et al. 2019), including a gamma-ray burst host galaxy at z = 7.8 (Tanvir et al. 2018) and a primitive galaxy group at z = 7.7 (Tilvi et al. 2020). Recently, a large-scale campaign with Keck/MOSFIRE using 10 nights targeted six dozen systems, achieving 10 detections at redshifts z = 7.1–8.2 (Jung et al. 2020; see also Pentericci et al. 2018). The demonstrated ability to spectroscopically confirm high-redshift galaxies using near-UV emission lines redward of Lyα was a hallmark achievement for the study of early galaxies. As discussed in Section 2.7, the presence of neutral hydrogen in the IGM during the cosmic reionization process can substantially attenuate Lyα. Having other available lines for spectroscopic redshift confirmation may therefore be critical during the reionization process and at earlier times. Stark et al. (2015a) detected Ciii] 1909 Å in galaxies at z ∼ 6.029 and z = 7.213 with known Lyα redshifts. Stark et al. (2015b) detected Civ 1243 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα redshift of z = 7.045. Laporte et al. (2017) detected Lyα and Ciii] in a z ∼ 6.8 galaxy. At slightly lower redshift, an interesting discovery for understanding the internal ionizing spectrum of star-forming galaxies was the confirmation of Civ 1550 Å and Oiii] λ = 1666 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα z = 6.11 (Mainali et al. 2017). The presence of Ciii] has now been confirmed in galaxies at z = 7.51 (Hutchison et al. 2019; same object as Finkelstein et al. 2013), z = 7.73 (Stark et al. 2017; same object as Oesch et al. 2015), and recently z = 7.945 (Topping et al. 2021).',\n",

       "   'text': \"Besides outflowing in a wind, cold clouds also fall onto the central galaxy under gravity. Such clouds could originate from thermal instability in the halo, cosmological accretion, or galactic fountain recycling (Fraternali 2017). The question of whether such clouds can survive and grow is crucial for explaining observations of IVCs/HVCs, as well as fueling of star formation in the disk (Putman et al. 2012). There is a crucial distinction between outflowing and infalling gas clouds. The latter gradually entrain, so destruction processes become weaker until the cloud comoves with the hot gas, and hydrodynamic instabilities are quenched. By contrast, infalling clouds never become comoving—they accelerate under the action of gravity and have to survive unrelenting shear at the terminal velocity. HVC simulations often simulate a wind tunnel, which ignores this distinction, though some simulations include gravity (Heitsch & Putman 2009) and find cloud growth (Grønnow et al. 2022, Heitsch et al. 2022). Condensation in the cloud's wake means that it is largely composed of cooled halo gas; the contamination increases linearly with time and from head to tail, impacting cloud metallicities (Heitsch et al. 2022). However, the survival criterion is more stringent (Tan et al. 2023): t\\ngrow ∼ χr/v\\nmix < t\\ncc (rather than t\\ncool,mix < t\\ncc). Survival is only weakly sensitive to cloud size. Instead, it is sensitive to cooling; a critical pressure is required for growth and accretion-induced braking. In our Galaxy, this corresponds to a distance of ∼10 kpc from the disk; above that, clouds should fall ballistically and must be large enough to reach the zone of survival. The drag due to accretion-induced mixing \\n\\n balances gravity F\\ngrav ∼ mg when \\n\\n, a terminal velocity that can be substantially smaller than traditional terminal velocities due to hydrodynamic ram pressure \\n\\n. Compared to the virial velocity v\\nvir ∼ gt\\nff, we have v\\nT,grow ∼ v\\nvir(t\\ngrow/t\\nff) < 1; i.e., infall is subvirial (Tan et al. 2023). Subvirial infall velocities are commonly observed in LRGs (Huang et al. 2016, Zahedy et al. 2019) and galaxy clusters (Russell et al. 2016). These velocities are much lower than predicted terminal velocities from traditional ram-pressure drag, unless the drop height of colds is fine-tuned (Lim et al. 2008). They are in much better agreement with velocities from accretion-induced drag (Tan et al. 2023).\",\n",

       "   'text': 'How can gas fragment to small scales? There are at least two possible mechanisms: (a) If the cooling time t\\ncool falls far below the sound-crossing time t\\nsc ∼ R/c\\n\\ns\\n in a cooling cloud, causing it to become strongly underpressured relative to surrounding hot gas, P\\ncloud ≪ P\\nhot, the cloud-crushing shock can shatter the cloud (McCourt et al. 2018). These authors argued that similar to the Jeans instability, where gravitational fragmentation leads to a characteristic scale λJ ∼ c\\ns\\nt\\nff, fragmentation in cooling, pressure-confined clouds imprints a scale ℓcloudlet∼c\\ns\\nt\\ncool ∼ 0.1pc(n/cm−3)−1, where the quantity c\\ns\\nt\\ncool is evaluated at its minimum at T ∼ 104 K. Although this length scale depends on the ambient pressure confining the clouds, the column density through an individual fragment N\\ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 is essentially independent of environment. Cooling of large (R ≫ c\\ns\\nt\\ncool) clouds that subsequently shatter is easily triggered by large nonlinear perturbations (e.g., via turbulence). Shocks are particularly effective at shattering cold gas, via either compression of preexisting cold gas (Mellema et al. 2002) or fragmentation in the radiative shock (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Shattering can also arise during initially isobaric linear thermal instability,\\n24\\n once the cloud loses sonic contact with its surroundings as it cools (Gronke & Oh 2020b, Das et al. 2021). (b) Another avenue for producing small cloudlets is via mixing in KH instabilities; the tails of clouds in winds show a plethora of dense small clumps (Cooper et al. 2009, McCourt et al. 2018, Sparre et al. 2019), which have a column density distribution that peaks at Ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 (Liang & Remming 2020), corresponding to the characteristic scale l ∼ c\\n\\ns\\n\\nt\\ncool suggested for cooling driven fragmentation. \\nFigure 11\\n shows fragmentation by these two respective processes. Shattering due to thermal instability in halo merger shocks can produce very low-metallicity LLSs, far from any galaxy (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Numerical resolution obviously affects the onset and efficiency of shattering, but it can even affect the multiphase nature of gas. Mandelker et al. (2021) find that if c\\ns\\nt\\ncool at T ∼ 105 K is unresolved, gas piles up at T ∼ 105 K as further cooling becomes inefficient.\\n',\n",

We illustrate some of these variations in \\nFigure 1\\n, in which we plot predictions for M\\ncrit from Schauer et al. (2021) and Kulkarni et al. (2021) and from models OHS and F13 in Hartwig et al.

For completeness, we also plot the estimate for M\\ncrit with v\\nst = 0 given by Equation 11, the minimum mass required for the development of a baryonic overdensity computed by Naoz & Barkana (2007), and the critical mass for an atomic cooling halo (taken from Hummel et al. 2012 and Hartwig et al. 2022). These systems have a virial temperature of about 104K, and their thermodynamic properties are dominated by Lyman-α cooling rather than H2 cooling (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). Halos of this mass and above are able to cool and collapse even in the presence of a very strong LW radiation background (Oh & Haiman 2002) or a high streaming velocity (Schauer et al. 2019), and so this curve constitutes the upper envelope of all models for M\\ncrit considered here.\\n\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Magnetic fields with that strength can strongly affect the evolution of protostellar accretion disks. If the field has a strong poloidal component, it can efficiently remove angular momentum from the star-forming gas and reduce its level of fragmentation (Machida et al. 2008a,b,c; Bovino et al. 2013; Latif et al. 2013, 2014b; Machida & Doi 2013; Hirano & Machida 2022; Saad et al. 2022), which influences the resulting IMF (Turk et al. 2011, Peters et al. 2014, Sharda et al. 2021). A highly ordered small-scale field can also drive protostellar jets and outflows (Machida et al. 2006, Sadanari et al. 2021). Finally, the presence of a dynamically significant magnetic field can also change the rotational properties of Pop III stars (Machida et al. 2007, Stacy et al. 2013), which in turn has consequences for their expected lifetimes and overall luminosity (see Section 4.2). One important caveat, however, is that many studies of the impact of the magnetic field assume that the field is highly ordered on small scales. This is not true initially for a field amplified by the small-scale turbulent dynamo, and although we expect the field to become more ordered over time, it remains unclear how rapidly this occurs, with recent simulations yielding contradictory results (Sharda et al. 2021, Prole et al. 2022b, Saad et al. 2022, Stacy et al. 2022).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Assuming that the oldest and most metal-poor stars in the Galaxy have been supplied with heavy elements by only one or at most two SN explosions—a common assumption but one that may not be true for all EMP stars (Hartwig et al. 2018b, 2019; Welsh et al. 2021)—one finds that the relative abundances of heavy elements are most consistent with CCSNe from Pop III stars in the mass range of 20–40M⊙ (e.g., Frebel et al. 2005; Iwamoto et al. 2005; Lai et al. 2008; Joggerst et al. 2009, 2010; Caffau et al. 2011a, 2012; Norris et al. 2013; Cooke & Madau 2014; Keller et al. 2014; Bonifacio et al. 2015), although a few examples exist of stars that are more consistent with enrichment by HNe (Placco et al. 2021, Skúladóttir et al. 2021) or PISNe (Aoki et al. 2014, Salvadori et al. 2019). The conclusion that most Pop III SNe were CCSNe is consistent with the work of Mapelli et al. (2006), who compute the expected density of intermediate-mass black holes in the Galaxy by assuming they are the relics of higher-mass Pop III stars. This allows them to derive an upper limit from the nondetection of ultraluminous X-ray sources in the Milky Way. The approach has been extended by de Bennassuti et al. (2014, 2017), who also include the Galactic metallicity function and the abundances of EMP stars. Again these data appear inconsistent with PISNe being important (although see Salvadori et al. 2019 for a contrary view). Taken together, these studies suggest that most Pop III stars forming through the standard pathway outlined in Section 3.2 are not likely to reach masses significantly above ∼40M⊙, with more massive objects being extremely rare and possibly being the result of collisions in very dense clusters (see Section 5.3).',\n",

Small grains suspended in the disk atmosphere absorb starlight and then reradiate some of that energy toward the midplane (Chiang & Goldreich 1997, D'Alessio et al. 1998). That central, external energy deposition produces an increasing T(z) (Calvet et al. 1991) and a decreasing T(r) (Kenyon & Hartmann 1987). Irradiation heating depends on the host-star spectrum as well as the microphysical properties and vertical distribution of the solids (D'Alessio et al. 1999, 2006; Dullemond et al. 2001, 2002). The latter is set by a balance between turbulent mixing and the solids–gas coupling (Dubrulle et al. 1995). When the solids-to-gas ratio is low (at large z or r), spectral line processes can super-heat the gas (Kamp & Dullemond 2004, Bruderer 2013). A variety of secondary heating sources—viscous dissipation (D'Alessio et al. 1998), spiral shocks (Rafikov 2016), radioactivity (Cleeves et al. 2013), external irradiation (e.g., from an envelope; Natta 1993, D'Alessio et al. 1997), or vertical structure perturbations (e.g., from self-shadowing; Dullemond & Dominik 2004b)—can also contribute significantly to the temperature structure.\",\n",

The first type is theoretical models (e.g., Krolik & Begelman 1988, Emmering et al. 1992, Collin & Zahn 1999, Beckert & Duschl 2004, Schartmann et al. 2005, Elitzur & Shlosman 2006, Hönig & Beckert 2007, Krolik 2007, Collin & Zahn 2008, Vollmer et al. 2008, Wada et al. 2009, Schartmann et al. 2010, Wada 2012) that were developed to explore specific aspects such as the formation, stability, shape, and evolution of the central structure. The models attempt to answer two fundamental questions. (a) What is the mechanism that removes angular momentum from galactic infalling gas, thus allowing the feeding of the central BH? (b) What mechanisms maintain a thick gaseous structure for a long period of time? Important processes considered in this context include blob motions along magnetic field lines, colliding magnetic clumps, radiation-pressure-supported dusty clumps, SF-driven turbulence, SN explosions, and AGN and stellar feedback via radiation pressure and winds, among others. Several analytic and semianalytic models have been proposed, but the hydrodynamic simulations seem to provide more realistic ways to model this complex situation. The second type is phenomenological, ad hoc models that make assumptions about the size, composition, and geometry of the torus to explain the observations, mostly the spatially resolved images and the NIR–MIR SED (e.g., Pier & Krolik 1992, Fritz et al. 2006, Nenkova et al. 2008a, Hönig et al. 2010, Stalevski et al. 2012).

       "   'text': 'A gaseous torus cannot retain a large height-to-radius ratio with pure rotation. Star clusters can retain such a shape but the gas between the stars cannot because cloud collision drives the gas to the plane on a few dynamic timescales. Maintaining a thick gaseous structure requires high-velocity turbulent motion, or outflow motion, and seems to work better in a clumpy medium where there are frequent cloud collisions (Beckert & Duschl 2004). Other mechanisms proposed to maintain a thick structure involve UV, optical, and IR radiation pressure (e.g., Hönig & Beckert 2007, Krolik 2007, Czerny & Hryniewicz 2011, Wada 2012); magnetic winds (Emmering et al. 1992, Königl & Kartje 1994, Elitzur & Shlosman 2006); and SF activity in the inflowing gas. UV-optical radiation by the central accretion disk, and locally (inside the torus) emitted IR radiation, can be combined into a plausible scheme that helps solve the scale height problem. Here clumps are pushed in the radial direction by the radiation from the central source in a way that depends on L\\nAGN/L\\nEdd (Hönig & Beckert 2007, Wada 2012). The central source heats the dust in the clumps, which in turn emit IR radiation. The local IR flux diffuses outward and is absorbed and reemitted by neighboring clumps, which results in a radiation pressure force that balances or overcomes the z-component of the central source gravity (Krolik 2007). In this scenario, an active AGN is necessary to both produce the toroidal structure and maintain its thick structure.',\n",

       "   'text': 'As explained above, two categories of methods are used to estimate fC\\n. The first category includes all methods for measuring the covering factor of individual objects (see Section 3): the L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method, the EW(K\\nα\\n) method, and the method based on the scattered X-ray continuum. The L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method results in the largest number of measured fC\\n. The second category includes methods that apply to the mean covering factor of the population. This is obtained by classifying a source as either a type-I or a type-II AGN and using the resulting N\\ntype-II,L\\n/N\\ntype-I,L\\n ratio as an estimate of the mean value of fC\\n. One such method measures the X-ray-absorbing column and determines the AGN type relative to a fiducial absorbing column that separates the groups (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003, Gilli et al. 2007, Hasinger 2008, Brightman & Ueda 2012, Malizia et al. 2012). Another method counts the number of broad- and narrow-emission-line AGNs in optical and IR-selected samples. Ideally, all methods should agree but this is not the case (e.g., Lawrence & Elvis 2010; Lusso et al. 2013, 2014; Mayo & Lawrence 2013). Mixed results are due to poorly understood physics of the torus, various selection effects, uncertainties in estimating L\\nAGN, and intrinsic reddening, among others. For example, the L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method is based on dust emission from the torus and has little to do with BLR properties. However, X-ray absorption by gas in the BLR can increase the total measured X-ray column, thus decreasing L\\ndust because the ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust-free gas never interacts with the dusty torus. Here I focus on the large-sample approach, in particular on X-ray based studies.',\n",

       "   'text': 'To date, there is no complete theoretical understanding of the origin of the whole shape of the IMF, including the characteristic mass of the break or turnover. A wide range of physical processes has been invoked as being responsible for shaping the IMF during star formation, including turbulent fragmentation, magnetic fields, and radiative feedback from massive protostars (e.g., Padoan & Nordlund 2002, Bonnell et al. 2006, Krumholz 2006, Hennebelle & Chabrier 2008, Bate 2009, Hopkins 2012). Some of these conjectures favor an IMF that depends on the environment in which star formation proceeds: e.g., those where the characteristic mass scale is set by the Jeans mass (or its equivalent in turbulent models), which in turn depends on the ambient density, temperature, etc. Extensive efforts to measure the IMF in different star-forming regions in the MW have not found compelling evidence for systematic dependence on such properties (e.g., Bastian et al. 2010), although localized deviations from the standard form do seem to be present in a few regions (e.g., Luhman 2004, Lu et al. 2013). Hence much of the theoretical modeling effort cited above was aimed at accounting for the apparent near-universality of the IMF.',\n",

       "   'text': 'For many years, the only known low-redshift strong-lens system was Q2237+0305, the Einstein Cross (Huchra et al. 1985). In this case, the lensing galaxy is a barred spiral with σ ≈ 165 km s−1, at z = 0.038, and analysis yields a total Einstein-aperture M/L that is too small to be consistent with a Salpeter or heavier IMF (Ferreras et al. 2010), even assuming no contribution from DM. Smith et al. (2005) discovered the first low-redshift elliptical galaxy known to act as a strong lens. ESO325–G004, at z = 0.034, images a background galaxy into a partial Einstein ring, providing a very robust measurement of the mass projected inside a radius of 1.9 kpc (∼0.25 R\\neff). With a high velocity dispersion (σ ∼300 km s−1), absence of any apparent ongoing star formation, negligible rotation, and α-enhanced abundance pattern, this galaxy is typical of the objects found in other studies to have a (bottom-)heavy IMF. However, Smith & Lucey (2013) showed that the lensing mass implies Ψ to be consistent with a MW IMF (αlens = 1.04 ± 0.15). They assumed a theoretically motivated estimate for the projected DM contribution, but this is a small correction (15%) due to the small projected Einstein radius, and even attributing all mass to the stars yields a sub-Salpeter α factor. Three further low-z early-type lens galaxies have since been discovered (Smith et al. 2015, Collier et al. 2018). After corrections for the likely projected DM content, based on cosmological simulations, all of these galaxies have α consistent with a MW IMF, on ∼2-kpc scales. Efforts are underway to enlarge the samples of low-redshift strong lenses (Talbot et al. 2018, Collier et al. 2020). The approach can be augmented with upper limits on α from galaxies with close-projected but singly imaged background galaxies, when unambiguous limits on counter-images can be established (Smith et al. 2018).',\n",

       "   'text': 'For high halo masses, the evolution of the galaxies shows a clear two-phase characteristic (Naab et al. 2007, Feldmann et al. 2010, Oser et al. 2010, Johansson et al. 2012, Navarro-González et al. 2013, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016, Qu et al. 2017). At early times (z≳1.5) the galaxies grow by in situ star formation in the deep potential wells of massive halos. As the low angular momentum gas is efficiently converted into stars, some of the systems can be remarkably small (also supported by mergers; Wuyts et al. 2010, Bournaud et al. 2011a), very similar to the population of observed high-redshift compact galaxies (Sommer-Larsen & Toft 2010; Oser et al. 2010; 2012; Wellons et al. 2016). Toward lower redshifts in situ star formation becomes less important as cold gas can no longer easily penetrate the shocked hot gaseous halos (e.g., Birnboim & Dekel 2003), and the mass assembly becomes dominated by the accretion of stars that have formed in other galaxies. Cosmological simulations clearly indicate that stellar accretion is more important at higher galaxy masses (Oser et al. 2010, Gabor & Davé 2012, Lackner et al. 2012, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016, Qu et al. 2017). This robust trend is also found in abundance matching estimates (Section 1.6) and semianalytical galaxy-formation models (Khochfar & Silk 2006, Guo & White 2008), and it is strongest for central galaxies in galaxy clusters (Ostriker & Hausman 1977, De Lucia & Blaizot 2007). The late, collisionless assembly has important consequences for the structural evolution of the system. As a significant fraction of mass can be accreted in mergers with smaller and less-bound systems (Gabor & Davé 2012, Lackner et al. 2012), this stellar mass is added to the systems at large radii (Oser et al. 2010, Navarro-González et al. 2013, Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016, Qu et al. 2017). The resulting strong increase in galaxy size is driven by accreted stars. Simple arguments based on the virial theorem (Bezanson et al. 2009, Naab et al. 2009) show that the same mass added in many minor mergers will produce a much more extended galaxy than if that mass had been added in fewer, more major mergers (Equation 1, Section 1.5). Together with the weak decrease in velocity dispersion the evolution of the individual model galaxies is consistent with observational estimates.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Most, if not all, stars form in star clusters and are expected to be temporally and spatially correlated, eventually driving superbubbles with more efficient energy coupling and momentum generation (e.g., Mac Low & McCray 1988, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Sharma et al. 2014). The typical velocity dispersion in newly born star clusters is ∼1 km s−1 or 1 pc Myr−1. Assuming the cluster becomes unbound, massive stars can travel up to 40 pc before they explode (assuming typical supernova delay times for single stellar populations). These walkaway stars can therefore easily leave their dense birthplaces and explode in lower-density regions. As most of the volume of the ISM is not in the cold phase, most supernovae might explode in the warm or hot phase, significantly changing the coupling efficiency (Slyz et al. 2005, Ceverino & Klypin 2009). There is also the runaway star population (Gies & Bolton 1986) (about 45% of O stars and 15% of B stars are runaways) with typical velocities of ∼30–40 km s−1 and maximum velocities as high as a few hundred kilometers per second (e.g., Silva & Napiwotzki 2011). These high-velocity stars originate from close binary systems becoming unbound by a supernova explosion (Zwicky 1957, Blaauw 1961) and/or from dynamical interactions in dense regions of star clusters (Poveda et al. 1967). They can travel up to several hundreds of parsecs away from their birthplaces far into interarm regions or the lower galactic halo. Their explosion locations in galactic disks can therefore be considered as almost random, similar to the explosions of type Ia supernovae, which contribute about 20–25% to the supernova rate in the Solar Neighborhood (Tammann et al. 1994). They explode independently of the gas mass distribution within the ISM, a process approximately taken into account in high-resolution simulations of stratified disks that are most useful to study the launching of outflows and, at the same time, create a realistically structured ISM (e.g., de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Hill et al. 2012, Li et al. 2017). Such detailed small-scale simulations with a realistic ISM structure will help to bridge the gap in scale and physical understanding to galaxy-scale simulations.',\n",

For many years, simulated galaxies formed far too many stars, particularly at early cosmic epochs when the cosmic inflow rate is high, thus ending up too massive, too compact, and with too little angular momentum (e.g., Navarro & Benz 1991, Navarro et al. 1995, Sommer-Larsen et al. 1999, Navarro & Steinmetz 2000). Unsurprisingly then, they also exhibited unrealistic surface density and rotation velocity profiles (Abadi et al. 2003a,b).

       "   'text': 'The physical mechanism by which AGN feedback couples to the ISM remains poorly understood, with a number of channels being plausible, such as radiation pressure on free electrons and/or dust grains or very high-velocity jets. Despite this absence of consensus, there is ample observational evidence to indicate that AGNs drive large-scale, high-velocity outflows of ionized and molecular gas (e.g., Maiolino et al. 2012, Cicone et al. 2014). Subgrid AGN feedback models generally assume that some fraction, ϵ\\nf, of the radiated luminosity of an SMBH accretion disk couples to the surrounding ISM: The AGN feedback energy \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is the accretion rate and c is the speed of light (e.g., Springel et al. 2005). As with stellar feedback, the injected energy can be coupled to the numerically modeled gas fluid in thermal and/or kinetic form. The simplest approach assumes that the coupling efficiency is fixed, such that the energy injection rate is proportional to the accretion rate. However, motivated by the observation that high-velocity jets are more typically associated with accretion onto SMBHs at small fractions of the Eddington rate (Churazov et al. 2005, Merloni & Heinz 2008, Best & Heckman 2012), some models adopt a relatively low (high) value of ϵ\\nf when the SMBH is accreting at a high (low) fraction of the Eddington rate (e.g., Sijacki et al. 2007, Dubois et al. 2012, Weinberger et al. 2017, Davé et al. 2019). Because the Eddington rate depends linearly on the mass of the SMBH, this approach can act like a switch, whereby efficient feedback is triggered once the SMBH reaches a threshold mass.',\n",

       "   'text': 'The level of realism achieved by state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy population has advanced dramatically in the past decade. Despite this success, the outcomes are particularly sensitive to subgrid implementations of feedback processes. It is thus reasonable to argue that this success suffices only to establish that the basic sketch of galaxy-formation theory within the ΛCDM cosmogony is plausible. The development of simulations that can be used to stress test a truly comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution will require confrontation of the devil in the details. Simulations of the galaxy population do not accurately reproduce the internal and vertical structure of galaxies and their reliance on subgrid methods to approximate the influence of unresolved physics leaves lingering degeneracies that diminish predictive power. Furthermore, the simulations neglect physical processes known to be significant in certain regimes. From our suite of examples, only IllustrisTNG models magnetic fields, which could impact cosmic gas flows and thus affect the evolution of galaxies (Pillepich et al. 2018a, van de Voort et al. 2021). The omission of magnetic fields also precludes realistic modeling of the influence of cosmic rays, which, owing to their ISM energy density being comparable with those of the thermal and magnetic pressures, likely influence galaxy-wide outflows (Uhlig et al. 2012). Similarly, thermal conduction influences the structure of the ICM and cooling onto massive galaxies (Carilli & Taylor 2002) but is generally neglected. Modeling the UVB as a spatially uniform radiation field that “switches on” at a fixed redshift is a particularly crude approximation for the evolution of galaxies during the EoR, when local sources of ionizing radiation can dominate the regulation of galaxy growth (Wise & Cen 2009, Trebitsch et al. 2017, Katz et al. 2020). Locally varying radiation fields, such as those produced by flickering AGNs, can also overionize gas and lead to cooling rates being overestimated by orders of magnitude if equilibrium conditions are assumed (Vasiliev 2011, Richings et al. 2014).',\n",

The hard, power-law X-ray spectrum, highly super-Eddington luminosity (isotropic X-ray luminosity of ∼1047 erg s−1), radio synchrotron spectrum, and power-law decline of the X-ray light curve were explained as having viewed an on-axis collimated jet launched by the tidal disruption of a star by the galaxy's central ∼106-M⊙ black hole. In fact, a class of jetted TDEs had been predicted by Giannios & Metzger (2011), but their models focused on off-axis emission from the interaction of the jet with the interstellar medium (ISM), and radio searches had only yielded a few late-time detections (Bower 2011, Bower et al. 2013), implying that ∼10% of TDEs launch jets. Two more jetted TDE candidates were detected by Swift with similar X-ray and radio properties: Swift J2058+05 (Cenko et al. 2012b, Pasham et al. 2015) and Swift J1112-82 (Brown et al. 2015). The implied rate of jetted TDEs is only ∼3 × 10−10 year−1 galaxy−1, suggesting a combination of the effects of a small beaming angle (∼1°), and that only ∼10% of TDEs produce relativistic jets (Brown et al. 2015).\",\n",

In the absence of self-gravity and for an approximately isothermal equation of state, this turbulence leads to a log-normal density distribution (e.g., McKee & Ostriker 2007) and a corresponding log-normal distribution of surface densities (Brunt et al. 2010). Self-gravity leads to the formation of a power-law tail in the probability distribution function (PDF) for dense gas (Collins et al. 2012). This has been observed in the PDF of surface densities in a number of GMCs, \\n\\n for clouds with active star formation; this is often associated with an overall power-law density distribution in the cloud (Lombardi et al. 2015, Schneider et al. 2015).

The ONC is the densest region, and, despite its small volume, represents a significant fraction of the total number of stars in the complex. We illustrate one recent measurement of the age distribution in Orion in \\nFigure 13\\n, which suggests three important conclusions that apply to other star-forming regions as well (e.g., Tan et al. 2006, Azimlu et al. 2015, Caldwell & Chang 2018, Getman et al. 2018). First, the densest regions show age spreads that are substantially larger than their dynamical times. Using the ages shown in \\nFigure 13\\n, the time over which 90% of the ONC stars formed is ≈6 Myr (other studies give similar results: Reggiani et al. 2011, Da Rio et al. 2016, Beccari et al. 2017), whereas the free-fall time is ≈0.6 Myr (Tan et al. 2006, Da Rio et al. 2014). Consequently, star formation has been ongoing for ≈10 free-fall times. Although the absolute ages and the magnitude of the age spread depend on the choice of age indicator, the conclusion that there is a substantial age spread is robust against this choice and against possible contamination due to photometric variability (Messina et al. 2017) or variable accretion histories (see the sidebar titled False Age Spreads for Accreting Young Stellar Objects?). This conclusion is also bolstered by kinematic observations showing that the ONC is very close to virial equilibrium (Kim et al. 2019), implying that it must have had time to relax dynamically.\\n',\n",

Many super-Earths are ≳10 M⊕, which is large enough to be the cores of giant planets. However, there are several important caveats to this connection. First, super-Earths have a different orbital period distribution than giant planets, with their occurrence rate dropping steeply with orbital period within 10 days (see Lee & Chiang 2017, and references therein), as we discuss further in Section 4.4. The relative occurrence rates can only be reconciled if it is much easier for cores to grow in gas giant planets very close to the star rather than further from the star, which is not what we expect from planet formation theory (Section 2.1). Second, in situ formation tends to produce multiple nearby planets (e.g., Hansen & Murray 2013, Becker et al. 2015), as we discuss in Section 4.2. Finally, increasing Δ beyond 7 requires mergers of multiple cores via giant impacts. However, damping from the gas disk prevents orbits from crossing until after the gas disk dissipates. Lee & Chiang (2016) highlight this argument as the strongest against forming hot Jupiters in situ. Furthermore, Δ has a hard upper limit set by the escape velocity (e.g., Schlichting 2014), which limits the self-stirring growth of cores' eccentricities for orbit crossing.

       "   'text': \"In gas disk migration, torques from the gaseous protoplanetary disk can shrink a giant planet's semimajor axis from several astronomical units to hundredths of an astronomical unit (e.g., Goldreich & Tremaine 1980, Lin & Papaloizou 1986, Lin et al. 1996, Ida & Lin 2008; see Baruteau et al. 2014 for a comprehensive review). The planet exchanges angular momentum with the disk by perturbing nearby gas onto horseshoe orbits (via corotation torques) and deflecting more distant gas (via Lindblad torques). The net Lindblad torque tends to be inward (Ward 1997; see also Armitage 2013 for a pedagogical overview of migration torques). The strength and sign of corotation torques depend on the disk's turbulent viscosity, opacity, and radial entropy profile (e.g., Paardekooper & Mellema 2006, Duffell & Chiang 2015); for disk conditions, corotation torques can drive a net outward migration. As the planet deflects gas, it can clear a gap; the resulting reduction in its migration speed depends on the disk viscosity and scale height. It was once believed that a sufficiently massive planet could staunch the flow of gas across the gap and that the planet would move inward on the timescale of the disk's viscous accretion onto the star (type II migration). Staunching gas flow would have guaranteed inward migration at or above the disk's viscous accretion rate. However, recent simulations have shown that a significant amount of material passes through the gap on horseshoe orbits (e.g., Duffell et al. 2014, Dürmann & Kley 2015), and the type II migration rate can be slower than the viscous rate. The contribution of gas disk migration to the origin of hot Jupiters remains ambiguous because the magnitude and sign of the migration rate are highly sensitive to disk conditions.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"\\n2.3.1.2. Secular interactions.\\nSecular interactions are slow exchanges of angular momentum between widely separated planets. Secular interactions take place over thousands or even millions of years, depending on the separation and mass of the planets involved. Through secular interactions, a Jupiter can deposit its angular momentum into other planets or stars in the system on a timescale of many orbits. Planets can swap angular momentum periodically (e.g., Petrovich 2015b) or chaotically (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011, Hamers et al. 2017), driving the Jupiter's eccentricity to large values. The latter scenario requires three or more planets and is known as secular chaos. (Chaos can occur in hierarchical two-planet systems as well, but it requires large eccentricities and inclinations; see Wu & Lithwick 2011 for a discussion.) Kozai–Lidov cycles are a type of periodic angular momentum exchange that also trade off mutual inclination and eccentricity (Kozai 1962, Lidov 1962, Naoz 2016). Kozai–Lidov cycles can also occur in an initially coplanar system when the outer body is on a highly elliptical orbit (Li et al. 2014b). Kozai–Lidov cycles driven by a star (e.g., Wu & Murray 2003, Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007, Katz et al. 2011, Naoz et al. 2012, Petrovich 2015a) or planet (e.g., Naoz et al. 2011; see Teyssandier et al. 2013 for distinctions between planet–planet and planet–star Kozai) have been widely hypothesized to trigger high-eccentricity tidal migration of hot Jupiters. In another scenario, multiple secular frequencies within a system coincide, creating a secular resonance that elevates planets' eccentricities (e.g., Minton & Malhotra 2011, Xu & Lai 2016). Examples of several types of secular excitation interactions are shown in \\nFigure 3\\n.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'The Λ-cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model provides a framework to understand how galaxies form and evolve from first principles (see, e.g., the review by Frenk & White 2012). In this model, galaxies form inside dark matter halos (White & Rees 1978). Most of the dark halos’ properties (such as mass function, abundance number, etc.) depend on the characteristics of the cosmological model, including, for example, the power spectrum of density fluctuations, the type of dark matter, and the values of the cosmological parameters (as discussed extensively in Mo et al. 2010). Because in the concordance model there is ∼6× more mass in dark matter than in baryons (this is supported by measurements of, e.g., the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background; Planck Collab. et al. 2016), many of the properties of galaxies, such as how they cluster or their dynamics, are largely dictated by their dark halos. A direct example of this is the process of halo collapse and formation, during which dark halos attract baryonic material from which the (visible components of) galaxies can form. For the baryons in a gaseous configuration to be able to cool and form stars, several conditions need to satisfied (dictated by, e.g., cooling and heating processes and dynamical timescales; see Mo et al. 2010). If these conditions are satisfied, the gas will cool and collapse to the center of their halos while conserving some amount of angular momentum. This results in a gaseous disk that is rotationally supported (Mo et al. 1998), with some amount of random motion depending on the state of the gas (Bournaud et al. 2009). Note that, particularly in the early universe, gas can also be directly accreted as a cold flow and feed the forming galaxy (Dekel et al. 2009). In the cold gas disk, stars will start to form. In fact, most star formation in the Universe takes place quiescently and is not associated with large starbursts (see Brinchmann et al. 2004, Elbaz et al. 2011).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Understanding the age distribution is trickier because there are fewer precise constraints. However, there is a simple explanation for why the halo should generally be older than the thin disk. Since mergers were much more frequent in the past, a thin disk could only grow to its full current extent after the major epoch of merger activity. The concordance model predicts that the first stars will form in the highest density peaks, which will collapse first and which are typically associated with the more massive objects at later times (e.g., Diemand et al. 2005). This would mean that the first stars in our cosmic environments ought to have formed in the proto–Milky Way. Cosmological simulations suggest these first stars are likely part of the bulge or inner spheroid (White & Springel 2000, Tumlinson 2010, Starkenburg et al. 2017, El-Badry et al. 2018), whereas the outer halo is slightly younger. Thus, a slight age gradient (recall that we are discussing the epoch before the thin disk as we know it was in place) could arise from the fact that lower-mass objects typically form their first stars a bit later. Later accreted objects would also have continued forming stars longer and so contributed to the trend (Carollo et al. 2018). An age gradient was what Searle & Zinn (1978) discovered when studying the age distribution of halo globular clusters, and what led to their fragments model of the formation of the halo. Outer globular clusters are younger, and this is also apparent in recent studies of blue horizontal branch stars (Santucci et al. 2015). However, the age and metallicity distributions, particularly of the outer halo, could be rather patchy and could depend on the specifics of the merger history (e.g., orbits, time of infall) and mass spectrum of accreted objects (e.g., Font et al. 2006).',\n",

Through this feedback, massive stars have a profound impact on the evolution of disk galaxies (van der Kruit & Freeman 2011). Massive-star feedback may also terminate star formation locally, blowing giant bubbles (Cox 2005) and leaking hot processed gas into the Galactic Halo (Putman et al. 2012). Elemental yields from nuclear burning in the cores of massive stars and explosive nucleosynthesis in SNe provide the elements in the periodic table that pollute the ISM, driving galactic chemical evolution and the metallicity (Z) evolution of the Universe. Through their violent deaths as SNe, massive stars provide brilliant displays that permit us to dissect individual stellar interiors at distances of many megaparsecs while the star's inner layers are peeled away for us to see (Filippenko 1997). They leave behind exotic corpses such as black holes, neutron stars, pulsars, magnetars, and all the bizarre high-energy phenomena that occur when compact objects remain bound in a binary system (e.g., Remillard & McClintock 2006). Shock fronts in their beautifully complex SN remnants echo through the ISM for thousands of years after the bright SN display has faded (Reynolds 2008).\",\n",

Clumps are expected on a size scale comparable to the Sobolov length, given by the thermal velocity divided by the radial velocity gradient in the wind (dv/dr), which means that clumping should exist on a size scale smaller than the stellar radius. Clumping may also be induced at the base of the wind because of subsurface convection driven by the Fe opacity bump (Cantiello et al. 2009). In fact, it has long been known that hot-star winds are probably clumpy on small scales (Hillier 1991, Drew et al. 1994, Moffat & Robert 1994) and inhomogeneous on larger scales; large scales include such complexities as the time-variable discrete absorption components (Howarth et al. 1995, Massa et al. 1995, Cranmer & Owocki 1996, Fullerton et al. 1997) or axisymmetric winds due to rapid rotation (Owocki et al. 1996), and a wide array of magnetically induced inhomogeneities (Townsend et al. 2005, ud-Doula & Owocki 2002).

       "   'text': \"These direct detections of LBV-like progenitors and of pre-SN outbursts provide unambiguous evidence for violent eruptive mass loss associated with the latest phases in a massive star's life. This only occurs in ∼9% of core-collapse SNe (Smith et al. 2011b). The extremely short timescale of only a few years probably hints at severe instability in the final nuclear burning sequences, especially Ne and O burning (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Quataert & Shiode 2012, Shiode & Quataert 2014, Smith & Arnett 2014), each of which lasts about 1 year. These instabilities may be exacerbated in the most massive stars, although much theoretical work remains to be done. The increased instability at very high initial masses is extreme in cases in which pre-SN eruptions result from the PPI (Woosley et al. 2002, 2007), but eruptions may extend to other nuclear burning instabilities as well (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Smith & Arnett 2014). Although the events listed above are just a few lucky cases, they may also be the tip of the iceberg. Undoubtedly, continued work on the flood of new transient discoveries will reveal more of these cases. [Indeed, as this review went to press, Fraser et al. (2013b) reported the recovery in archival data of an outburst one year before the SN IIn-P 2011ht.] The limitation will be the existence of high-quality archival data over long timescales of years before the SNe, but these sorts of archives are becoming more populated and improved as time passes. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope arrives, it may become routine to detect pre-SN outbursts, although constraining their physical nature with spectra will still be a challenge.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'While UV–near-IR photometry is inefficient at identifying obscured AGN, UV–near-IR spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry have been essential tools for the identification and characterization of obscured AGN. Optical spectroscopy led to the discovery of Seyfert galaxies (Seyfert 1943) and the identification of the two main spectral classes of AGN (e.g., Khachikian & Weedman 1974, Weedman 1977): Type 1 systems, where the bright optical continuum and both broad and narrow emission lines are observed (i.e., unobscured AGN), and Type 2 systems, where the optical continuum is weak and only narrow emission lines are observed (i.e., obscured AGN), as illustrated by the composite spectra shown in \\nFigure 3\\n. Optical spectropolarimety of Seyfert 2 galaxies has furthermore shown that many have the features expected for a Seyfert 1 galaxy (broad emission lines and a strong UV–optical continuum) when observed in polarized light (e.g., Antonucci & Miller 1985, Tran 2003, Moran et al. 2007, Ramos Almeida et al. 2016); such a galaxy is commonly referred to as a hidden Seyfert 1, a hidden Type 1 AGN, or a hidden BLR. The Seyfert 1 features are undetected in optical spectroscopy because of the obscuring torus but are seen in spectropolarimetry because the emission is scattered (and hence polarized), by electrons/dust grains within the NLR, into the line of sight of the observer.

       "   'text': 'A surprising result from the analysis of the mid-IR continuum of AGN is that obscured AGN have broadly similar mid-IR SEDs to unobscured AGN, both when using measurements on the scale of the whole galaxy (e.g., Buchanan et al. 2006, Mateos et al. 2012, Hickox et al. 2017; see \\nFigure 3\\n) and for spatially-resolved measurements on parsec scales (e.g., Ramos Almeida et al. 2011, Asmus et al. 2014). This is in disagreement with what was expected from the basic unified AGN model, since the presence of obscuration should suppress the mid-IR emission from an obscured AGN (with greater suppression of the shorter-wavelength emission). Indeed, it is often not possible to reliably distinguish between an obscured and an unobscured AGN on the basis of just the mid-IR colors, and optical or X-ray data are required to determine whether the AGN is obscured or unobscured (e.g., Barmby et al. 2006, Hickox et al. 2007). These findings are a key driver behind the idea that the obscuring dust in AGN is not distributed in a smooth torus but is clumpy and allows for the mid-IR emission to escape from the torus without being obscured (see Section 4.1; see also, e.g., Netzer 2015, Ramos Almeida & Ricci 2017). Furthermore, high–spatial resolution mid-IR imaging has also revealed that a large fraction of the mid-IR emission from some obscured AGN is produced from dust in the polar regions rather than the torus (see \\nFigure 2\\n and Section 4.1.5; see also, e.g., Raban et al. 2009, Asmus et al. 2016).',\n",

       "   'text': 'An axiomatic feature of most torus models is that the obscuring gas and dust are broadly symmetric along the rotation axis of the accretion flow. This is motivated by the presence of ionization cones observed in NLR gas (e.g., Zakamska et al. 2006, Fischer et al. 2013) and hidden BLRs in some Seyfert 2 galaxies (see Section 2.1.2). However, recent high-resolution observations of a handful of nearby AGN tori using mid-IR interferometry have revealed the presence of substantial dust emission along the polar direction on parsec scales (e.g., Hönig et al. 2012, Tristram et al. 2014, López-Gonzaga et al. 2016). These polar structures can extend to larger scales, as shown by imaging observations (e.g., Asmus et al. 2016). The physical origin of these features is still unclear but may be associated with an AGN-driven outflow (e.g., Schartmann et al. 2014). In addition, recent observations have cast some doubt on the notion of a compact torus being the sole origin of reflected X-ray emission, as is often assumed in the modeling of obscured AGN (e.g., Murphy & Yaqoob 2009, Brightman & Nandra 2011). Spatially resolved Chandra observations have found evidence for Fe Kα lines produced up to ≈1 kpc away from the nucleus (e.g., Bauer et al. 2015, Fabbiano et al. 2017). Taken together, these results suggest that emission features that have previously been attributed to a compact, axisymmetric torus may often originate from gas and dust with very different geometries.

Also noteworthy is that many planets in compact systems have very low densities (≲1 g cm−3; see, e.g., Lissauer et al. 2013, Wu & Lithwick 2013, Masuda 2014), which have mainly been revealed through the transit-timing method. The prevalence of small, low-density planets could be a clue about their formation. It may also be related to the requirement for long-term stability.

The temperature calculations also need to take into account viscous heating in the dense inner disk midplane and the decoupling of gas and dust temperatures in the disk atmosphere (Glassgold et al. 2004). The latter effect can be solved explicitly by taking into account dust and gas heating and cooling processes (Kamp & Dullemond 2004). These processes depend on the gas chemical composition; therefore, self-consistent determination of the temperature structure can only be done using thermochemical models that iteratively calculate the disk gas temperature and chemical abundances (Woitke et al. 2009, Bruderer et al. 2012, Du & Bergin 2014). Finally, cosmic rays permeate through the entire disk and are typically incorporated at or below the H ionization rate in dense interstellar clouds (e.g., Cleeves et al. 2015b).

The simpler chemical models have been used to establish qualitative interpretative frameworks and to couple disk dynamics and time-dependent chemistry. “Full” chemical reaction networks always include various forms of two-body chemical reactions; UV-, X-ray-, and cosmic-ray-driven chemistry; adsorption and desorption of gas molecules on grain surfaces; and simple surface chemistry, such as the formation of H2 (e.g., McElroy et al. 2013). Reaction data are available in databases like the UMIST Database for Astrochemistry (McElroy et al. 2013) and KIDA (Wakelam et al. 2012), from which appropriate chemical reaction networks can be developed (e.g., Semenov et al. 2004, Kamp et al. 2017). Additional reactions are then added, depending on the particular science question. Models developed to treat the formation of organic molecules and/or the chemical evolution of icy grain mantles add surface chemistry reactions (Walsh et al. 2015, Ruaud & Gorti 2019, Furuya et al. 2022), often inspired by protostellar chemistry models (Jørgensen et al. 2020 and references therein). Models focused on the inner disk often expand their networks to include high-temperature gas-phase chemistry, three-body reactions, and/or warm surface chemistry (Agúndez et al. 2008, Thi et al. 2020, Anderson et al. 2021). Isotope fractionation is included in models where the precise distributions of minor isotopologues are important (e.g., Aikawa & Herbst 1999, Lyons & Young 2005, Willacy & Woods 2009, Miotello et al. 2014, Visser et al. 2018). To compare the calculated chemical structures (densities and column densities) with observations, one can input the disk gas and dust density and temperature structures, the chemical abundance of the emitting species, and molecular line excitation data into a radiative transfer code (e.g., Brinch & Hogerheijde 2010) and then an observational simulator (the final step in \\nFigure 2\\n).',\n",

Cases where lines are likely in non-LTE include millimeter observations of the disk atmosphere and rovibrational lines. A common approach in these cases is to use an LVG (Large Velocity Gradient) approximation (Piétu et al. 2007, van der Tak et al. 2007) or Monte Carlo–based radiative transfer codes (Brinch & Hogerheijde 2010, Hogerheijde & van der Tak 2000) coupled with an observation simulator to extract molecular abundances. The disk abundance structure can be parametric (e.g., Qi et al. 2011) or the product of a disk chemistry code (Bruderer et al. 2012, Du et al. 2015, Cleeves et al. 2018), but in either case the retrieval is achieved by quantifying the goodness of fit of the different abundance structures to the observations. For IR lines, fast line ray tracers can also be coupled to thermochemical codes to predict the rich line emission from disk regions with large velocity gradients (Pontoppidan et al. 2009, Bosman et al. 2017, Woitke et al. 2018).

A detailed description of dust mass measurements techniques in nearby galaxies is given by Galliano et al. (2018). The second ingredient in Equation 3 is the gas-to-dust mass ratio, δGD. The value of δGD is linked to metallicity (Z), and in many applications a simple scaling with metallicity of δGD ∝ Z\\n−1 is assumed (Issa et al. 1990, Leroy et al. 2011). However, studies of the δGD(Z) relation reveal important scatter across the local galaxy population and a possible steepening of the relation at lower metallicity (Rémy-Ruyer et al. 2014, De Vis et al. 2017). For nearby galaxies, the method summarized in Equation 3 is best used to estimate total gas masses, M\\ngas, or to estimate \\n\\n when resolved maps of dust and Hi are available. This allows for a pixel-by-pixel estimation of \\n\\nafter subtraction of the \\n\\n contribution to the total gas mass.

The largest single cold gas surveys in the nearby Universe are xGASS (Catinella et al. 2010, 2012, 2013, 2018) and xCOLD GASS (Saintonge et al. 2011a,b, 2017), which obtained Hi and CO observations for 1,179 and 532 galaxies, respectively, at 0.01 < z < 0.05. The objects were selected from SDSS and are representative of the full galaxy population with M\\n\\\\* > 109 M⊙. The strength of these surveys comes from their sample size, the homogeneity of all the data products, and the depth of the observations. As is shown in Section 4, the latter is of particular importance as it makes it possible to infer the cold gas properties of even the most gas-poor subpopulations, via either spectral stacking or the setting of stringent upper limits. Other notable global cold gas surveys include RESOLVE (Stark et al. 2016), designed to be baryonic mass limited; HRS (Boselli et al. 2010), which includes 322 galaxies (225 of which have CO observations and 315 have Hi data from the literature) that span the full range of environments, from low-density regions to the core of the Virgo cluster; and ALLSMOG (Bothwell et al. 2014, Cicone et al. 2017), which observed CO(2–1) in 88 galaxies in the mass range of 108.5 < M\\n\\\\*/M⊙ < 1010, increasing the coverage of parameter space toward lower-mass galaxies. These surveys have been key in making cold gas a mainstream element in the multiwavelength toolbox of extragalactic observers.',\n",

Despite these statistical tests, the distance scale of GRBs continued to be debated at least into the mid-1990s (Lamb 1995, Paczynski 1995).

The required kick velocities can be inferred from a comparison of the projected physical offsets and the host-galaxy stellar population ages, taking into account the host masses. Although projection effects and uncertainty about the age of any specific short GRB progenitor relative to the host mean stellar population age prevent the extraction of a detailed distribution, it is still possible to determine characteristic kick velocities. Making the assumption (Bloom et al. 2007) that the required kick velocities are roughly the geometric mean between the minimum required velocity (v\\nkick,min=δR/τ∗) and the host velocity dispersion (v\\ndisp≈120 km s−1 for late-type hosts and ≈ 250 km s−1 for the more massive early-type hosts; Battaglia et al. 2005, Xue et al. 2008), the resulting projected kick velocities span v\\nkick∼20–140 km s−1 with a median value of about 60 km s−1 (Fong & Berger 2013). This range is consistent with the kick velocities derived for Galactic NS-NS binaries based on population synthesis models, v\\nkick≈5–500 km s−1 (Fryer & Kalogera 1997; Fryer, Burrows & Benz 1998; Wang, Lai & Han 2006; Wong, Willems & Kalogera 2010). It is important to note that the inferred distribution of kicks for short GRBs is consistent with some progenitors having negligible kicks, and it does not strictly require velocities that will unbind the progenitors from their hosts.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the DD scenario, the more-massive WD is generally thought to tidally disrupt and accrete the lower-mass WD, initially through an accretion disk configuration, that then likely takes on a more spherical geometry (e.g., Lorén-Aguilar, Isern & García-Berro 2009; Pakmor et al. 2012; Raskin et al. 2012; Schwab et al. 2012; Shen et al. 2012; Moll et al. 2014). Accretion of carbon and oxygen at a high rate should prevent the problems of inefficient mass growth, encountered in novae, and eventually lead to carbon ignition in the core. Against this concept, however, it has long been argued that the large accretion rate leads to off-center ignition and burning of carbon in the accretor to oxygen and neon. Further accretion and approach to M\\nCh drives electron capture on Mg and Ne, leading to gravitational instability and to an “accretion-induced collapse” to a neutron star (Nomoto & Iben 1985, Saio & Nomoto 1998, Shen et al. 2012). The collapse could manifest itself as some kind of non-SN Ia, low-luminosity, hydrogen-free transient [Darbha et al. (2010) and Piro & Kulkarni (2013) consider the signatures of such an event]. By contrast, rotation of the merger remnant has been considered as a way to slow down the accretion and to avoid off-center ignition (Piersanti et al. 2003, Tornambé & Piersanti 2013; see also Section 2.5, below).',\n",

       "   'text': 'However, members of a subclass of novae called recurrent novae have long been suspected as possible SN Ia progenitors (e.g., Starrfield, Sparks & Truran 1985; Della Valle & Livio 1996; Schaefer 2010; Kato & Hachisu 2012). Recurrent novae are defined as novae with more than a single outburst over the past century or so. There are only 10 recurrent novae known in the Galaxy. Some of the donor stars are main-sequence, some subgiants, and some red giants. Recurrent novae have eruptions every few decades on an irregular basis. Because the mass needed for ignition scales inversely with both WD mass and accretion rate (Fujimoto 1982, Truran & Livio 1986, Shen & Bildsten 2009), these short recurrence times have been interpreted to indicate that the WD mass is close to M\\nCh, specifically M≳1.2M⊙, and that the accretion rate is relatively high, i.e., the same parameters for which mass gain may be possible. A number of observational mass estimates are indeed suggestive of large WD masses, but uncertainties are large and there are only two double-lined eclipsing systems that have reliable mass estimates: U Sco, with a WD mass of 1.55±0.24M⊙ (Thoroughgood et al. 2001), and CI Aql, with 1.00±0.14M⊙ (Sahman et al. 2013). Observationally, little is known about the formation of massive WDs in binaries, so it is unclear if these high masses indicate that the WDs have accumulated mass. Recurrent nova eruptions may in fact be caused by instabilities in the accretion discs, leading to periodic accretion at the steady-burning rate, during which the WDs do grow in mass (Alexander et al. 2011). Then again, Hachisu & Kato (2012) point out that it is unclear if steady burning can ignite for such short accretion episodes.',\n",

Optical spectroscopy and multiwavelength photometry of cluster galaxies has shown that most of their stars were formed within short episodes (∼100 Myr) at high redshift (z ∼ 3; Jimenez et al. 2007, Rettura et al. 2011), a good approximation to the δ-function burst defining the DTD. Thus, an almost-direct measurement of the DTD is provided by the observed SN Ia rate per unit stellar mass in galaxy clusters as a function of the time since the cluster's star-formation epoch (i.e., the cosmic epoch at the observed cluster redshift minus the stellar formation epoch). Cluster SN Ia rates have been measured over the past decade in the redshift range 0<z<1.5, corresponding to DTD delays of 2–10 Gyr (Gal-Yam, Maoz & Sharon 2002; Germany et al. 2004; Maoz & Gal-Yam 2004; Sharon et al. 2007; Gal-Yam et al. 2008; Graham et al. 2008; Mannucci et al. 2008; Dawson et al. 2009; Dilday et al. 2010a; Maoz, Sharon & Gal-Yam 2010; Barbary et al. 2012; Sand et al. 2008, 2012).

The constraining power of the IFS data allowed the JAM dynamical models to explore, with a Bayesian approach, a range in dark matter inner slopes including a flat inner dark matter profile, a standard NFW profile (Navarro, Frenk & White 1996), and a contracted halo (Gnedin et al. 2004) as special cases. Even with this freedom, the models were unable to reproduce the photometry and IFS kinematics by varying the dark matter fraction alone (for an illustration, see Cappellari et al. 2012). The only remaining option for the discrepancy was a systematic variation of the IMF (Cappellari et al. 2012). This was inferred to vary in mass normalization over the full galaxy mass range from Milky-Way type (Kroupa 2001, Chabrier 2003) to heavier-than-Salpeter (1955) type, with a dependence on galaxy velocity dispersion (Cappellari et al. 2012, 2013a). The IMF variation contrasted with previous evidence of a universal IMF (Bastian et al. 2010). However, the IMF for the most massive galaxies in the sample appeared consistent with previous indications of a heavy IMF in massive ETGs from either stellar population (van Dokkum & Conroy 2010) or strong gravitational lensing (Auger et al. 2010b). A recent update to the IMF-σ relation by Cappellari et al. (2013a) was obtained by combining \\n\\n determinations from ATLAS3D with fully consistent redeterminations of \\n\\n from SLACS (Sloan lens ACS) (Bolton et al. 2006), combining strong lensing masses with JAM models.

The trend is much reduced in the field (Dressler et al. 1997, Fasano et al. 2000, Postman et al. 2005, Smith et al. 2005). These results indicate that spiral galaxies become passive and transform into S0s because of cluster environmental effects (Boselli & Gavazzi 2006). The morphological evolution is less significant at the largest galaxy masses, which indicates that these massive ellipticals were already passive from larger redshift and remain so during their evolution (Stanford et al. 1998, Postman et al. 2005, Tasca et al. 2009), while most of the observed evolution consists of a transformation of spirals into S0s (Smith et al. 2005, Moran et al. 2007).',\n",

They form disk galaxies, which at high redshift are observed to have high gas fractions (Daddi et al. 2010, Tacconi et al. 2010), have large velocity dispersions, be turbulent compared with their local counterparts (Förster Schreiber et al. 2006, 2009; Genzel et al. 2006, 2008; Law et al. 2012; Kassin et al. 2012; Stott et al. 2016), and appear unstable to clump formation (Elmegreen et al. 2007, Genzel et al. 2011). These clumps may sink toward the center and start forming the bulge (Bournaud et al. 2007, Dekel et al. 2009), or the gas may simply spiral toward the nucleus to grow the bulge in starbursts. During the initial stages, when the velocity dispersion of their groups is quite small, gas-rich mergers can also happen. Isolated spirals are able to sustain nearly constant star formation for a long time, possibly with the contribution of the so called cosmological fountain effect (Fraternali & Binney 2008, Fraternali 2014). During this phase they lie on the so-called star-formation main sequence (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Salim et al. 2007).',\n",

Historically, it was believed that the neutral gas provided all the raw material for the formation of stars, so its redshift evolution should counterbalance the star-formation activity over the history of the Universe (Wolfe et al. 1986). The relatively modest evolution throughout cosmic time of the neutral gas density is in contrast to the now well-determined star-formation rate (SFR) density, which rose sharply to a peak at redshifts \\n\\n–2 before declining by an order of magnitude to today's modest levels of star formation (Madau & Dickinson 2014).

The change in comoving stellar mass density is from an integration of the SFR density of Madau & Dickinson (2014) (see Section 3.5.1; we assume 50% uncertainties). The negative change in neutral gas density is based on the power-law fit in the main figure. At \\n\\n, the increase in stellar mass is significantly larger than the neutral gas consumption. These observations call for the global and continuous replenishment of the neutral gas from the ionized gas reservoir in the IGM (e.g., Wolfe et al. 2005, Prochaska & Wolfe 2009, Zafar et al. 2013).\",\n",

From this, we infer the required rate of transformation to reproduce the rise in total condensed matter. This is the result of the net conversion of ionized gas from the CGM and IGM reservoirs into cold gas and stars (e.g., Wolfe et al. 2005, Prochaska & Wolfe 2009, Bauermeister et al. 2010, Zafar et al. 2013). This is inclusive of recycling material on galactic scales, with some material previously ejected and ionized by feedback returning to the condensed phases. We plot this net rate of conversion of ionized gas into the condensed phase per unit volume in \\nFigure 6b\\n\\n. The net accretion rate density continuously declines with cosmic time. Also plotted is the baryonic accretion rate onto halos as a function of redshift. We calculate the total mass accretion as the virial mass growth rate of halos from Dekel et al.

The baryon mass accretion rate is the total matter accretion rate scaled by the cosmic baryon fraction (\\n\\n in our adopted cosmology). The baryon and net condensed matter accretion rates have similar shapes; both are high until \\n\\n and then drop significantly through today. The drop in accretion rate at low redshift is caused in part by the expansion of the Universe as galaxies are driven away from each other by the repulsive force of dark energy; accretion and merging are slowed, and galaxies are gradually starved of incoming fuel. This accretion rate includes the effects of both smooth accretion and mergers, whose mix changes with redshift and halo mass (Padmanabhan & Loeb 1999).',\n",

       "   'text': 'The study of exoplanetary atmospheres has progressed at a tremendous pace in recent years. Just a decade ago, fewer than 25 transiting exoplanets were known, and the first directly imaged planets were just being discovered. Observations of exoplanetary atmospheres were still in their infancy. Prior to that, only a handful of atomic species were detected robustly, mostly in the two famous transiting hot Jupiters, HD 209458b and HD 189733b, using transmission spectra in the optical and UV obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; Charbonneau et al. 2002, Vidal-Madjar et al. 2003). The first detections of exoplanetary atmospheres using space-based IR photometry and spectrophotometry with the Spitzer Space Telescope (\\nSpitzer\\n) and HST were being made by Deming et al. (2005), Tinetti et al. (2007), Charbonneau et al. (2008), Grillmair et al. (2008) and Swain et al. (2008). The instruments used for these early measurements [such as the HST/NICMOS (Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer) and Spitzer photometric instruments] were never designed for exoplanetary observations, which require extreme sensitivities (e.g., photometric precisions better than \\n\\n). As such, the early measurements were intensely debated for their accuracy, and several were subsequently revised as the systematics were better understood and analysis methods improved. This is in stark contrast to the present day as high-confidence and reproducible detections of exoplanetary spectra with HST are routine, as discussed below. At the same time the first attempts for atmospheric observations from the ground were also being made (Redfield et al. 2008, Sing & López-Morales 2009). Even so, inferences of molecular absorption and pressure–temperature (P-T) profiles (e.g., thermal inversions) relied heavily on forward models with solar-like elemental compositions and equilibrium conditions (Burrows et al. 2008, Knutson et al. 2008). Statistical constraints on atmospheric properties of exoplanets using atmospheric retrieval methods were still a dream for the future. On another front, the first thermal phase curves, and brightness maps, were being observed for hot Jupiters using IR photometry with Spitzer (Knutson et al. 2007). At the same time, the first 3D atmospheric circulation models were being developed for hot Jupiters (Showman et al. 2008) to explain the observed thermal phase curves. In summary, about a decade ago major observational facilities were being pushed to their limits to detect spectra of transiting exoplanets. At the same time, concomitant developments in theory were being pursued to explain the extant observations, however sparse. Such were the humble beginnings of atmospheric characterization of exoplanets a decade ago.',\n",

These models compute the chemical, thermal, dynamical, and radiative properties of the atmosphere in extensive detail. The first coupled GCMs with both radiative and dynamical treatment started a decade ago (Showman et al. 2009); a number of GCMs are prevalent in the field today with varied levels of complexity. The latest GCMs span a wide range of irradiation conditions—from highly irradiated planets to nonirradiated isolated substellar objects—and orbital parameters (e.g., eccentricities, obliquities) and masses (e.g., Parmentier et al. 2013, Showman et al. 2013, Kataria et al. 2016, Mendonça et al. 2016, Boutle et al. 2017, Dobbs-Dixon & Cowan 2017, Lewis et al. 2017, Rauscher 2017, Drummond et al. 2018, Lines et al. 2018). These models have been used to explain thermal phase curves of hot Jupiters (Showman et al. 2009, Kataria et al. 2016, Lines et al. 2018) and to explore various physical processes in detail (Showman et al. 2009; Parmentier et al. 2013, 2016; Drummond et al. 2018). One of the key successes of GCMs is the predictions of strong equatorial jets in irradiated hot Jupiters that can lead to shifting of the hot spot in the dayside atmospheres away from the substellar point (Showman & Guillot 2002). This effect, predicted over a decade ago (Showman & Guillot 2002, Showman et al. 2009), has been substantiated by other GCMs in the literature (e.g., Rauscher & Menou 2010, Showman & Polvani 2011, Drummond et al. 2018) as well as by numerous observations of hot Jupiters as discussed in Section 4.4. These models have also recently considered the effect of latent heat on the atmospheric properties through condensate formation and chemical recombination (Tan & Showman 2017, Bell & Cowan 2018). GCM models also show a trend of day–night temperature contrasts in hot Jupiters increasing with equilibrium temperatures (Komacek et al. 2017), which is consistent with observations and empirical studies (Komacek et al. 2017, Schwartz et al. 2017). Atmospheres of highly irradiated and tidally locked hot Jupiters have also been predicted to contain larger planetary-scale bands compared to those of weakly irradiated and faster rotating planets like the Solar System giant planets.',\n",

       "   'text': 'Atmospheric retrieval refers to deriving the atmospheric properties of a planet from its observed spectrum. The canonical retrieval method comprises a parametric forward model of an exoplanetary atmosphere coupled with a parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the model parameters given a spectral data set. The free parameters in the model include the dominant chemical species with strong features in the observed spectral bandpass, the temperature profile, and the macroscopic cloud/haze parameters, e.g., the location in the atmosphere, spatial extent, and opacity, besides any other free parameters relevant to the spectrum at hand. The first retrieval codes came out a decade ago (Madhusudhan & Seager 2009, 2010); a number of codes are currently available in the field with applicability over the wide range of observations possible. A recent review of existing retrieval codes and capabilities in the field is available from Madhusudhan (2018). The latest developments in retrievals include incorporation of nonequilibrium phenomena at varying levels of complexity, such as different prescriptions for clouds/hazes (e.g., Line et al. 2016, Barstow et al. 2017, Lavie et al. 2017b, MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017b), deviations from radiative–convective equilibrium (Gandhi & Madhusudhan 2017), and benchmarking with 3D circulation models (Blecic et al. 2017). State-of-the-art codes use a wide range of parameter estimation methods spanning Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Blecic et al. 2017), optimal estimation gradient-descent algorithm (Barstow et al. 2017), and nested sampling algorithm (e.g., Benneke & Seager 2013). More recently, machine learning algorithms have been explored for atmospheric retrieval (e.g., Waldmann 2016). In recent years, state-of-the-art retrieval codes have allowed detailed constraints on the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, and properties of clouds/hazes in a number of exoplanets, both transiting and directly imaged (Madhusudhan 2018).',\n",

       "   'text': \"This body of observational work has led to a fairly robust outline of the evolution of the stellar mass buildup and star-formation activity of galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) over most of the Universe's history (Madau & Dickinson 2014). As much as half of the stellar mass observed in galaxies today was formed in just about 3.5 Gyr between \\n\\n and \\n\\n. After a rapid rise \\n\\n, the cosmic star-formation rate (SFR) volume density peaked around \\n\\n and subsequently declined as \\n\\n to \\n\\n. The comoving rate of SMBH accretion follows a similar evolution, in support of coevolution of central black holes and their host galaxies. This evolution in cosmically averaged rates finds its counterpart in the observed properties of individual SFGs, which around \\n\\n were forming stars and feeding their central black holes ∼10 times faster than today's SFGs. At least up to \\n\\n, the vast majority of SFGs tightly follow a roughly linear main sequence (MS) between SFR and stellar mass (e.g., Rodighiero et al. 2011, Speagle et al. 2014), whose zero-point evolution reflects the decline in cosmic SFR density to the present time. Other scaling relations involving size, kinematics, and metal and gas content are also observed as early as \\n\\n (e.g., van der Wel et al. 2014b, Übler et al. 2017, Maiolino & Mannucci 2019, Tacconi et al. 2020). Detailed mapping of the distribution and motions of stars and gas within galaxies has begun to probe the internal workings of galaxy evolution as well as the spatial and temporal progression of the buildup of galactic components. Despite increasingly clumpy and irregular appearances at higher redshift, more so in the rest-frame UV (e.g., Conselice 2014), there is now compelling evidence that the bulk of (massive) SFGs have global disk-like stellar light distributions and kinematics (e.g., Wuyts et al. 2011b, Wisnioski et al. 2019).\",\n",

Assuming case B recombination and an electron temperature \\n\\n, the mass of ionized gas in the outflow can be estimated via \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is the intrinsic luminosity in the broad emission component and \\n\\n is the local electron density, from which the mass outflow rate can be computed as \\n\\n, where \\n\\n and \\n\\n are the outflow velocity and extent, respectively (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011, Newman et al. 2012a). Calculations typically assume H dominates the mass, and a 36% mass correction for He is applied. Based on these relationships, \\n\\n estimates in the range of ∼0.1 up to above unity were derived on galactic and subgalactic scales (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2012a,b; Davies et al. 2019; Förster Schreiber et al. 2019; Freeman et al. 2019; Swinbank et al. 2019).

Regions where the heating or chemistry is dominated by far-ultraviolet (FUV; 6eV < hν < 13.6eV) radiation are called photodissociation regions\\n1\\n (or PDRs; Tielens & Hollenbach 1985a). PDRs can have a range of incident FUV flux, densities, and column densities, depending on the distance between the stars that produce the FUV radiation and the gas environment where the FUV is absorbed. The “classic” PDR discussed by Tielens & Hollenbach is one in which FUV radiation is emitted by an O or early B star and passes through an Hii region to be absorbed in an adjoining molecular cloud. In general, these are high-density and high FUV field PDRs (e.g., Tielens & Hollenbach 1985b, Meixner et al. 1992, Tielens et al. 1993) and are where feedback from radiative and mechanical energy of massive stars acts on the neutral gas. The FUV radiation from the OB association may also illuminate more distant parts of the molecular cloud and produce PDRs with low radiation fields but greater area than the high-intensity PDRs (Stacey et al. 1993). In addition, the OB stars contribute FUV radiation to the interstellar radiation field that illuminates molecular clouds but also illuminates the diffuse ISM, where the field strength, density, and column densities are lower than they are for the classic PDRs (Wolfire et al. 1995a, 2003).

       "   'text': 'Because there are no stellar EUV photons beyond the Hii region boundary, H and He cannot be ionized by the radiation field but can be ionized by cosmic rays that penetrate the PDR.\\n9\\n It is this ionization by cosmic rays that drives much of the ion–neutral chemistry in PDRs (exceptions are reactions with \\n\\n). Typical ion–neutral reaction rate coefficients are ∼10−9 cm−3s−1 with neither temperature dependence nor activation barrier, and thus ion–neutral chemistry proceeds rapidly compared to neutral–neutral reactions, which have typical rate coefficients of ∼10−11 cm−3 s−1. Typical ionization rates in diffuse gas are inferred from observations of ArH+, OH+, H2O+, and \\n\\n to be ζp ∼ 2 × 10−16 s−1\\n per H atom (Hollenbach et al. 2012, Indriolo et al. 2015, Neufeld & Wolfire 2017; see also Shaw & Ferland 2021 for the effects of variable PAH abundance). Each ionization of H, H2, or He, by a cosmic-ray electron of energy ≲10 MeV, produces a secondary electron of energy ∼35 eV that can further ionize another H or H2 (the fast cosmic ray being considered as the primary particle). The total rate including secondary ionizations in H and H2 gas is ζH ∼ 1.5ζp and \\n\\n, respectively, and depends in detail on the molecular and electron fractions (Glassgold & Langer 1974, Cravens & Dalgarno 1978, Dalgarno et al. 1999, Glassgold et al. 2012). Higher electron fractions result in more energy going into heat rather than secondary ionizations. The dependence of the ionization rate with column density into the PDR is not well known and depends on the incident cosmic-ray spectrum and interaction with turbulence and the magnetic field in the cloud (Padovani et al. 2009, Silsbee & Ivlev 2019). The low-energy cosmic rays are absorbed at increasing column density and decrease the total ionization rate compared to the rate at the surface. Observations indicate ζp ∼ 1.1 × 10−17 s−1 in protostellar envelopes (van der Tak & van Dishoeck 2000) and marginal evidence for a 1/N dependence in clouds (Padovani et al. 2009, Neufeld & Wolfire 2017). Higher ionization rates initially increase the abundance of molecular ions (Hollenbach et al. 2012, Le Petit et al. 2016); however, for ζp/n\\n2 ≳ 10−14 s−1 with n\\n2 = n/(100cm−3), the abundance of molecular ions decreases owing to the destruction of H2 by cosmic rays and because of an increasing electron abundance from ionizations leading to faster \\n\\n dissociative recombination (e.g., Le Petit et al. 2016). Increased ionization rates destroy CO by reactions with He+, requiring higher densities for formation and pushing CO deeper into the cloud (e.g., Gong et al. 2017). Similarly, internal sources of cosmic rays from, e.g., protostars can change the chemical structure by warming the gas in the interior and increasing the He+ density, which destroys CO and increases C (Gaches et al. 2019).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Using gamma-ray observations, Grenier et al. (2005) found gas that was not seen in either Hi or CO emission. It is now considered to be mainly molecular (Murray et al. 2018a) and is known as the CO-poor or CO-dark molecular gas that was observed earlier in translucent clouds and explained by theoretical models (van Dishoeck & Black 1987, Lada & Blitz 1988, van Dishoeck 1990). The CO-dark layer is located at an A\\nV ∼ 1 in PDRs, where H2 self-shielding creates a layer of H2, whereas CO forms deeper into the cloud (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). Wolfire et al. (2010) constructed theoretical models of the surfaces of illuminated molecular clouds and found, for local Galactic conditions, a CO-dark mass fraction of ∼30%. Values of ∼30–50% are roughly consistent with Galactic observations from gamma-ray observations (Grenier et al. 2005), dust emission from the Planck Surveyor Satellite (Planck Collab. et al. 2011), extinction from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (Paradis et al. 2012), [Cii] line emission from Herschel (Pineda et al. 2013), and mass estimates from numerical simulations of galactic disks where the CO-dark gas is found in interarm filaments (e.g., Smith et al. 2014; see also Kalberla et al. 2020). There is also a significant CO-dark fraction in the diffuse gas discussed in Section 7.3. The [Cii] and [Ci] emission can in principle trace the CO-dark gas but must be calibrated because the [Cii] also arises in Hi gas, and [Ci] misses the C+–H2 regions. Models (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2010, Nordon & Sternberg 2016, Madden et al. 2020) predict the dark gas fraction should increase at lower metallicity because of reduced shielding of the CO, although Hu et al. (2021) suggest the effect of metallicity is not as large as in previous models. The trend is confirmed by observations in the Galactic disk, where the metallicity decreases by a factor of ∼2.6 between 4 kpc and 10 kpc while the CO-dark gas fraction increases by a factor of ∼4 (Pineda et al. 2013, Langer et al. 2014), and also by observations in low-metallicity galaxies (Section 8.4).',\n",

The depths of the 3.0-μm H2O and 4.67-μm CO bands (McFadzean et al. 1989, Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2005) and the 4.62-μm XCN feature (Moneti et al. 2001, Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2009) vary with factors of ∼4 between these sources. As much as 60–80% of the H2O ices may be local to the inner parsec of the Galaxy, possibly in dense clumps in the circumnuclear ring or mini-spiral (Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2005). The foreground contamination is less certain for CO ices (Moultaka et al. 2009), but in any case the total column relative to H2O is small (<10%).

The CO profile has a strong apolar component (Moneti et al. 2001, Moultaka et al. 2005), and the 15.2-μm CO2 bending mode, observed in the ISO beam of ∼20 arcsec encompassing a number of IRS sources, shows a lack of thermal processing as well (Gerakines et al. 1999). Other detected ice species include NH3 and CH4, whereas solid CH3OH is notably underabundant (<5%; Chiar et al. 2000, 2002). The detection of the stretch mode of NH3 at 2.96 μm in ISO and high spatial resolution ground-based observations, supported by the presence of NH3.H2O hydrates at 3.2–3.7 μm and by the 6.2-μm bend mode, is unusual and implies a large NH3 abundance of up to 30% relative to solid H2O.

Robustly identifying patterns in the intrinsic distributions of planets can stimulate and test theories. Conversely, theoretical advances may also beam the searchlight on fresh observational ground, as exemplified by the development of the photoevaporation theory leading to the recent discovery of a radius valley (see Section 2.1.4). Since the last Annual Reviews article on exoplanet populations (Winn & Fabrycky 2015), the field of planet statistics has made significant progress. In particular, the large and homogeneous planet sample from the NASA Kepler mission (Borucki et al. 2010) has provided the best source for statistical studies, but a major shortcoming of the Kepler data was the initial lack of accurate stellar parameters for both the planet hosts and the target stars (i.e., the parent sample). In the past few years, substantial efforts have been dedicated to systematically characterize the Kepler sample and, thus, unleash its potential for statistical studies. These include asteroseismology (e.g., Chaplin & Miglio 2013, Van Eylen & Albrecht 2015), the Gaia data releases (Gaia Collab. et al. 2016, 2018), follow-up spectroscopic programs such as the LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fibre Spectroscopic Telescope; Cui et al. 2012, Zhao et al. 2012)-Kepler survey (e.g., Dong et al. 2014b, De Cat et al. 2015, Zong et al. 2018) and the California-Kepler Survey (CKS; Johnson et al. 2017, Petigura et al. 2017), as well as many projects of the Kepler Follow-up Observation Program (KFOP; Furlan et al. 2017). Furthermore, substantial works to understand the Kepler pipeline detection efficiency and vetting false positives have much improved the reliability of Kepler statistical inference (e.g., Christiansen et al. 2015, Morton et al. 2016).

       "   'text': 'The leading theory for the radius valley is the atmospheric evaporation driven by high-energy photons from the host star (photoevaporation) (Lopez & Fortney 2013; Owen & Wu 2013, 2017; Jin et al. 2014). In fact, the existence of the radius valley at approximately the discovered position had been predicted years before its discovery (Lopez & Fortney 2013, Owen & Wu 2013; see a historic overview in Owen 2019), which is exceptional in exoplanetary science. The photoevaporation of the atmosphere is thought to mostly take place during the early ages of the system when the star emits a higher fraction of its total luminosity at high energy (≲100 Myr; e.g., Jackson et al. 2012, Tu et al. 2015, but also see King & Wheatley 2021). For close-in (∼3–30 days) planets with core masses of a few Earth masses, the high-energy radiation is sufficient to unbind the entire hydrogen/helium atmosphere if its initial mass fraction is below some critical value (a few percent; Owen & Wu 2017). The radius valley thus emerges, separating planets with and without extended atmospheres (Lopez & Fortney 2013; Owen & Wu 2013, 2017). The observed period and stellar mass dependences can also be well explained by photoevaporation. As the orbital period increases and/or the host mass decreases, the amount of high-energy radiation the planet receives decreases, and thus the valley moves to smaller radii (Owen & Wu 2017, Wu 2019).\\n5\\n We refer interested readers to Owen (2019) for a comprehensive review on the photoevaporation mechanism.',\n",

Nevertheless, it is certainly oversimplified to assume that all planetary systems have the same number of planets (e.g., Ballard & Johnson 2016, Mulders et al. 2018). Having a Poisson distribution for the intrinsic multiplicity (e.g., Lissauer et al. 2011, He et al. 2019, Sandford et al. 2019, Zink et al. 2019) is likely not justified either. The underlying assumption behind the Poisson distribution is that occurrences and properties of individual planets around the same host are independent from each other. Although it has not been proved invalid for Kepler planets, there is emerging evidence that the presence and properties of planets inside the same system may be correlated because of the shared formation environment and/or host properties (see Sections 1.1, 2.4, and 2.5). Furthermore, the exponential or power-law (i.e., Zipfian distribution; Sandford et al. 2019) forms can be securely ruled out. These distributions predict overly abundant intrinsic single-planet systems, which is not supported by TTV observations (e.g., Ford et al. 2011).',\n",

Early estimates of their yield (see, e.g., Horne 2003) ran into the hundreds of planets per year, but these soon turned out to be highly optimistic. Although surveys such as the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) did indeed discover numerous transit-like events (see, e.g., Udalski et al. 2002), only a handful were ultimately confirmed as bona fide transiting planets, and the process took years. The vast majority of early transit candidates were later diagnosed as diluted or grazing stellar eclipses based on RV follow-up. Intriguingly, a small fraction turned out to be spurious detections, despite having relatively high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Indeed, Pont et al. (2006) noted that all the confirmed OGLE planets had very high SNRs, and they went on to show that the SNRs for all candidates had been overestimated due to the presence of correlated or red noise\\n8\\n in the light curves. They proposed an empirical method to evaluate the red noise on transit timescales from the individual light curves (analogous to the method proposed by Press et al. (1992a) to evaluate the correlation matrix of a quasar light curve), and then a prescription for adjusting the detection threshold accordingly. In effect, they were searching for a way to model the covariance of the data. This is precisely what GPR allows, but the methodology was not known in the exoplanet community at the time.',\n",

The idea is that the properties of the stochastic variations of an AGN light curve are driven by an accretion disk near the central supermassive black hole and that this variability provides an observational probe of the small scale astrophysical processes. The standard approach is to fit a GP model to the light curve—typically using a damped random walk kernel (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012), or the more general CARMA kernel (e.g., Kelly et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2022, Yu et al. 2022), because these permit efficient computations even with large data sets—and then to use the inferred hyperparameter values to constrain the variability amplitudes and timescales of the system (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012; Kelly et al. 2014; Kasliwal et al. 2017; Moreno et al. 2019; Stone et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2022).

Similarly, early studies of the SMC (e.g., Prevot et al. 1984, Gordon & Clayton 1998) found even steeper UV slopes. In short, though the optical extinction curve slopes for the LMC and the SMC fall within the range of MW sightlines, the UV slopes tend to be significantly steeper (\\nFigure 4b\\n\\n), highlighting the limitation of characterizing curve slopes with R\\n\\nV\\n alone. One can ask whether individual lines of sight within the LMC and SMC obey some other relationship, offset from that of the MW, but the current data are not of sufficient accuracy, nor do the LMC/SMC sightlines have a sufficiently wide range in optical slopes, to provide a definitive answer (Gordon et al. 2003).

Many theoretical studies have predicted this effect (Witt & Gordon 2000, Pierini et al. 2004, Inoue 2005), but it was in particular highlighted by Chevallard et al.

This relationship was subsequently postdicted in hydrodynamic cosmological zoom simulations (Narayanan et al. 2018a), as well as in large-box cosmological hydrodynamic simulations (Trayford et al. 2020). A physical origin for the optical depth–slope relationship was posited by Chevallard et al. (2013). Although the scattering albedo used by most theoretical studies is roughly constant in the optical, the phase functions are not: Red light scatters more isotropically than blue. Red photons emitted in the equatorial plane of the galaxy are more likely to escape, whereas blue photons have a comparatively increased likelihood of remaining and, subsequently, being absorbed. In the low optical depth limit, this corresponds to a steepening of the attenuation curve. In the high A\\n\\nV\\n limit, the contribution to the UV is dominated by stars located outside the τ = 1 surface, and the shape of the curve is flattened by both scattering into the line of sight and radiation from unobscured OB stars (Narayanan et al. 2018a).',\n",

For the most part, there is consensus among the varied theoretical efforts. Granato et al. (2000) demonstrated the importance of decoupled sites of emission of UV and IR radiation via consideration of the impact of birth cloud clearing times on their simulations. Similarly, Narayanan et al. (2018b) explicitly calculated the UV optical depths for hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution to arrive at a similar point, whereas Popping et al. (2017b) cast this result in the context of holes in obscuring dust screens, as well as the impact of increased turbulence in the obscuring ISM. In short, increasing optical depths move galaxies along the IRX–β relation (\\n\\nFigure 5\\n\\n) while increasingly decoupled star-dust geometries (i.e., a proxy for varying attenuation curves) displace galaxies vertically in IRX–β space. It is a point of consensus among theoretical models that the scatter in where star-forming galaxies present in IRX–β space is due to the diversity of underlying attenuation laws; this cause for the scatter has also been suggested in the interpretation of various observational data sets (e.g., Boquien et al. 2009, 2012; Mao et al. 2014; Álvarez-Márquez et al. 2019; Salim & Boquien 2019). What is unknown, however, is the root cause of the attenuation law variations. There is a degeneracy between variations in dust extinction curves (i.e., variations in grain sizes and/or the optical properties of grains) and the star-dust geometry in driving attenuation law variations. Both can impact the location of galaxies in the IRX–β space by modifying the attenuation curve.',\n",

In our standard picture for such disks (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), radial pressure gradients and radial magnetic forces are unimportant, and matter follows almost test-particle orbits in the black hole potential. Once the accreting matter reaches the ISCO, it will plunge into the black hole on orbits that conserve energy and angular momentum. Thus, such accretion disks possess a distinct transition at the ISCO, from a turbulent, dissipative, circulating flow outside the ISCO to a laminar, nondissipative, plunging flow within. As a practical matter, the ISCO defines the inner edge to the region of the accretion disk responsible for observed emission. The strong spin dependence of the ISCO induces a spin dependence to four key observables from the inner disk, (a) the maximum observed gravitational redshift, (b) the maximum observed disk temperature, (c) the maximum temporal frequencies observed, and (d) the overall radiative efficiency η. The majority of spin measurements published to date are based, ultimately, on this hypothesis that the ISCO effectively truncates the observable disk (Reynolds & Fabian 2008, Shafee et al. 2008a). We stress, however, that the ultimate accuracy of this hypothesis is closely tied to the physics of the inner accretion flow, which is still the subject of very active theoretical work. In particular, if the accretion disk is threaded by significant large-scale magnetic flux, the inner flow can become magnetically-arrested, and the significance of the ISCO may be diminished (Avara et al. 2016).',\n",

They showed that MIR and optical emissions have very similar morphologies and concentration indices (Boselli et al. 2003). However, the MIR scale length tends to be systematically smaller than the optical (Malhotra et al. 1996), and the arm/interarm contrast is larger in MIR than in optical observations (Vogler et al. 2005). From a large range of morphologies, Roussel et al. (2001) also found that, whereas the IR-to-optical size ratio does not seem to be affected by the presence of a bar, this ratio is particularly reduced in Hi-deficient galaxies and early-type galaxies (see also Bendo et al. 2002). Numerous analyses have shown that the MIR disk has a similar scale length to those of 12CO(1–0), Hα, and the radio continuum (Sauvage et al. 1996, Walsh et al. 2002, Vogler et al. 2005). The relation with Hα, in particular, indicates that the MIR scale length of a galaxy is determined by its star-forming activity. Indeed, MIR emission is enhanced in star-forming regions.

Spitzer confirmed that the concentration index varies with the wavelength. Studying radial profiles of 75 nearby galaxies, Muñoz-Mateos et al. (2009b) found that the concentration indices drop in the unidentified infrared bands (UIBs) (5.8 and \\n\\n; see Section 3.1.2). MIR observations at longer wavelengths indicate a wide variety of behaviors, including galaxies with very intense nuclear, circumnuclear, or outer-ring emissions and thus larger concentration indices (e.g., NGC 1291, NGC 1512, NGC 1097, NGC 3351).',\n",

       "   'text': '\\n2.1.1.2. Far-infrared/submillimeter scale length of dust.\\nFrom ISO observations, it quickly became clear that the disk scale length of IR emission increases with the wavelength (Hippelein et al. 2003), with a far-IR (FIR) scale length being greater than an optical scale length (Tuffs et al. 1996, Alton et al. 1998, Haas et al. 1998, Davies et al. 1999, Trewhella et al. 2000). This FIR color gradient observed in the disk suggests that part of the FIR emission arises from grains heated by the radially decreasing diffuse interstellar radiation field (ISRF). In the edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 891, Popescu & Tuffs (2003) showed that intense FIR emission was associated with an extended Hi disk, raising the question of whether grains are transported from the inner/optical disk, transferred via interactions or more resistant to destruction by shocks in the outer disk. Spitzer, \\nHerschel\\n, and plane- and ground-based submillimeter instruments have since revolutionized our vision of FIR/submillimeter emission and, in particular, have confirmed the detection of large, cold, extended disks (Block et al. 1994, Stevens et al. 2005, Hinz et al. 2012). In M51, the scale length of the 850-μm underlying exponential disk was estimated as ≃5.5 kpc (Meijerink et al. 2005). More statistically, Muñoz-Mateos et al. (2009a) and Hunt et al. (2015) examined the exponential dust profiles of 60–70 nearby galaxies. They showed that the FIR scale length does not vary strongly with galaxy type and is on average ≃10% larger than stellar scale lengths.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In PDRs, the gas is primarily heated by photoelectrons ejected from the grains (Draine 1978). The PE heating is most efficient for the smallest sizes, particularly for the carriers of the UIBs (see, e.g., Weingartner & Draine 2001). This heating efficiency therefore depends on the dust properties and thus on the environment. Assuming that [Cii]\\n\\n is the main gas coolant, the PE efficiency, ϵPE, can be approximated by the gas-to-dust cooling ratio: ϵPE≃LCii\\n/L\\nTIR. Detailed studies usually add other lines to the gas cooling rate, such as [Oi]\\n\\n, to have a more complete estimate (see, e.g., Cormier et al. 2015). Overall, Smith et al. (2017) found that 0.1%≲ϵPE≲1%, with an average of 〈ϵPE〉≃0.5%, in a sample of 54 nearby galaxies. It appears that ϵPE is lower when the dust temperature is higher (Rubin et al. 2009, Croxall et al. 2012). This is not likely the result of the destruction of the UIB carriers, as their intensity correlates best with the [Cii]\\n\\n emission (see, e.g., Helou et al. 2001). It is conjectured, rather, to result from the saturation of grain charging in UV-bright regions. The shape of the ISRF also has consequences for the accuracy with which L\\nTIR represents the true UV PE-efficient flux. Indeed, Kapala et al. (2017) showed that the variations of ϵPE in M31 could be explained by the contribution of old stars to \\n\\n. Finally, one of the most puzzling features is that \\n\\n is higher at low metallicity (Poglitsch et al. 1995, Madden et al. 1997, Cormier et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2017), while the UIB strength drops in these systems (see Section 4.3.4). This is currently poorly understood. However, in the extreme case of I Zw 18 (Z≃1/35Z⊙), where no UIB is detected and the PE heating is estimated to be negligible, the gas-cooling-to-TIR ratio is still ≃1% (Lebouteiller et al. 2017).

Planets (see the sidebar What Is a Planet?)? Beginning with Adams et al.

In contrast, Boss (1997) argued that the direct collapse of clumps from GIs can create massive gas giant planets (see also Durisen et al. 2007, and references therein). More recently, a series of papers starting with Nayakshin (2010) have proposed that a combination of GI and tidal stripping can even produce rocky planets. Considering which disks are susceptible to GI and fragmentation reveals parameters unfavorable to the formation of planets but favorable to the formation of more massive wide-orbit companions. In Section 4, we have seen that unstable disks are massive, which leads to large initial masses for fragments; they are often undergoing rapid infall, which can enhance the subsequent growth rates; and they are experiencing rapid angular momentum transport, which can cause rapid migration and destruction of marginally bound objects (which are the most likely to be low in mass in the first place).

Garrod & Herbst (2006) presented a model of hot-core chemistry in which the surface mobility, and thus the reactivity, of radicals on grain surfaces would be enhanced by including the gradual warm-up of the gas and dust, which had previously been considered only in the context of the desorption of grain-surface molecules (Viti & Williams 1999, Viti et al. 2004). In these models, radicals are produced largely as the result of photodissociation (i.e., photolysis) of stable, solid-phase species such as methanol (CH3OH), caused by cosmic-ray-induced UV photons. Reactions between the radical products of methanol dissociation become prominent at temperatures of 20–40 K, resulting in the subsequent formation of many COMs. Many of those linger on grain surfaces until temperatures upward of 100 K are reached, where they sublimate and become observable in the gas phase. The models were expanded to include a larger network of radical reactions (Garrod et al. 2008) that was quite successful in providing a basic framework for the production of many COMs, which has been extended over subsequent years to include newly detected species (Müller et al. 2016a, Belloche et al. 2017, Garrod et al. 2017), especially toward Sgr B2(N).',\n",

       "   'text': 'A major area of new ice-chemistry research involves the production of COMs at very low temperatures without the need for diffusion of large radicals (thermally or otherwise), nor with any initiating energetic process. Fedoseev et al. (2015) found that codeposition of H and CO at low temperatures could produce COMs, which they suggest occurs through the production of glyoxal (HCOCHO) via HCO radical addition, which is subsequently hydrogenated to produce glycolaldehyde and ethylene glycol. In this scheme, the low-temperature chemistry that produces methanol by hydrogen addition would allow more complex species to be formed in tandem. Reactions between HCO radicals would be the result not of diffusive meetings but rather of their occasional production in close enough proximity that little or no diffusion would be required. The HCO radical could also plausibly react with CO itself, mediated by an activation energy barrier but with little need to diffuse. Subsequent studies have highlighted cold pathways to other COMs, through deposition of additional species (Fedoseev et al. 2016, Dulieu et al. 2019, Qasim et al. 2019). In this review, we refer to such processes generically as nondiffusive, although they may indeed be initiated by the diffusion of H atoms, which are mobile even at very low temperatures. It seems likely that nondiffusive mechanisms could make a significant contribution to the COM content of star-forming regions. However, methyl formate does not seem to be produced in sufficient quantities to explain its interstellar abundance, and photolysis may therefore still be required (Chuang et al. 2016) if it originates in the solid phase. Astrochemical models have treated nondiffusive reactions in the past on a case-by-case basis (Garrod & Pauly 2011), but new models are beginning to include more general treatments for this cold chemistry (e.g., Jin & Garrod 2020).',\n",

       "   'text': 'Thanks to its short distance, Orion KL can be studied in greater detail than Sgr B2, and many signs of chemical differentiation have been seen within this source. For example, resolved CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) observations showed that cyanides peak at different locations from other species such as CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Friedel & Snyder 2008). A differentiation between N-bearing COMs (cyanides and NH2CHO) and O-bearing COMs (alcohols, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO) has also been inferred from differences in their excitation temperatures from Herschel observations by Crockett et al. (2015), who found that the former trace hotter gas (200–300 K) than the latter (100–150 K). However, the CH3C(O)CH3 emission detected with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) resembles more the cyanide emission than that of CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Peng et al. 2013, Feng et al. 2015), two COMs that were found to be strongly spatially correlated (Brouillet et al. 2013). To complicate the situation even further, Favre et al. (2017) demonstrated with ALMA that CH3COOH and (CH2OH)2 trace a more compact region located closer to the hot core than other O-bearing COMs. Analyzing a larger sample of O-bearing COMs detected with ALMA, Tercero et al. (2018) confirmed this result and showed that there is in fact a more general spatial segregation between the COMs containing a C-O-C structure and the COMs containing a C-OH bond, the former tracing the compact ridge and the latter the hot core. Tercero et al. (2018) interpret this segregation as resulting from the chemistry being dominated by different radicals in these two regions, methoxy (CH3O·) in the former and hydroxymethyl (·CH2OH) in the latter. One caveat in these discussions is that integrated intensity maps intended to trace a particular transition of a given COM may be contaminated by emission from other species due to the complex velocity structure of the Orion KL region (Pagani et al. 2017). A more reliable method would be to construct column density maps from LTE fits of the spectrum of each pixel (e.g., using the VINE method; Calcutt et al. 2018b).',\n",

       "   'text': \"Around galaxies, Hi exists in the form of highly diffuse, infalling gas that replenishes the disk Hi reservoir and provides an important energy contribution. Cosmological simulations predict diffuse, infalling Hi with column density below 1018 cm−2 and large concentrations originating from galaxy interactions (Stevens et al. 2019). Around the Milky Way, large concentrations of Hi are associated with the Magellanic System, and smaller, dense concentrations are scattered throughout the halo and disk–halo interface as high- and intermediate-velocity clouds. The Milky Way's circumgalactic medium has been well reviewed by D'Onghia & Fox (2016) and Putman et al. (2012). Instead, we focus on the properties of Hi in the disk of the Milky Way, where it is perpetually in the act of flowing between its dense, cold state and its warm, diffuse state. Hi is present over a range of temperatures between ∼20 K and ∼8,000 K (Heiles & Troland 2003b), tracing most of the semiquiescent conditions of a galaxy. While the star formation rate of a galaxy is tightly linked to its molecular hydrogen (H2) content, the star formation rate per unit Hi mass varies widely among and within galaxies (Leroy et al. 2008). The standard interpretation is that star formation in galaxies is separated into two processes: one in which molecular clouds are assembled from Hi and another in which stars form from H2 (Schruba et al. 2011). In fact, the key regulator of star formation appears to be not the formation of H2 itself but rather the formation of gas that is sufficiently shielded to reach very low temperatures so that thermal pressure cannot prevent collapse (Krumholz et al. 2011, Glover & Clark 2012). Hi can therefore be considered the fuel for star formation and the key ingredient responsible for the shielding and survival of molecular gas. The transition from warm, unshielded to cold, UV-shielded Hi might act as a throttle in the process of converting the interstellar medium (ISM) into stars, making it essential to the evolution of galaxies.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Numerical simulations of the ISM are invaluable for understanding how the many, varied physical processes of the ISM shape Hi over a wide range of environments. Huge advances in computational facilities and techniques in recent years have moved from 2D idealized boxes with basic feedback processes driven artificially at a fixed rate (Audit & Hennebelle 2005) to 3D, self-consistent, parsec-scale, multiphase simulations that track the effects of different feedback sources, such as supernovae, stellar winds, cosmic rays, and radiation (Kim et al. 2013, Kim & Ostriker 2017, Rathjen et al. 2021). Even still, numerical simulations are not able to provide the dynamic range needed to self-consistently track the Hi from large-scale, infalling, diffuse gas all the way to molecular clouds within a larger galactic context (outflows, disk–halo interface regions, galactic rotation). However, many simulations have demonstrated the importance of including the large-scale fundamental processes to shape Hi in realistic ways. Hopkins et al. (2012, 2018, 2020) showed that stellar feedback is essential to reproduce realistic Hi morphology observed in the Milky Way and other galaxies; without it, simulated gas density distributions are too high and lead to runaway star formation and unrealistic phase distributions. Similarly, the distribution of spatial power, represented by the spatial power spectrum (SPS), requires stellar feedback to match observations (Iffrig & Hennebelle 2017, Grisdale et al. 2018).',\n",

       "   'text': 'The various observational studies published on Hi supershells throughout the late 1990s and 2000s made it clear that the role of supershells is to order the diffuse Hi into large-scale, filamentary structures visible throughout the Galactic Plane. Does the Hi also cool within these structures? Simulations have shown that supershells sweep up the warm, ambient medium into dense, structured filamentary walls where the gas can cool to form CNM and molecular clumps (Koyama & Inutsuka 2000, Mac Low et al. 2005, Hopkins et al. 2012). From an observational perspective, this role is less well documented, although there have certainly been examples of supershells with associated molecular gas (e.g., Fukui et al. 1999, Dawson et al. 2008). McClure-Griffiths et al. (2003) found clumps of narrow-linewidth Hi in the walls of a large supershell, suggesting that the structures were formed by Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. Both Knee & Brunt (2001) and Moss et al. (2013) used HISA to show that the walls of two supershell structures were dominated by cold gas. The most comprehensive analysis of supershells as collectors and coolers of gas was produced by Dawson et al.

       "   'text': 'Most chemical abundance determinations of stars are based on one-dimensional (1D) model stellar atmosphere analyses that assume hydrostatic equilibrium, flux constancy, and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), and these determinations treat convection in terms of a rudimentary mixing-length theory. To first order, the basic atmospheric parameters that define the model are effective temperature (T\\neff), surface gravity (log g), and chemical composition ([M/H], where M refers to metals). We refer the reader to Gray (2005) and Gustafsson et al. (2008) for the concepts associated with stellar atmosphere modeling. For details of the more realistic and rigorous three-dimensional (3D) model atmosphere and non-LTE (hereafter NLTE) formalisms, rather than the 1D/LTE approximations, see Asplund (2005), and the references therein; examples of recent developments in these areas are found in Lind et al. (2012), Ludwig & Kučinskas (2012), Magic et al. (2013), and Tremblay et al. (2013). We have discussed the corresponding abundance differences that result from these two approaches previously (Frebel & Norris 2013, see their figure 11) to which we refer the reader for details. In brief, differences between LTE and NLTE results, on the one hand, and between 1D and 3D analyses, on the other, are of an order ∼0.5 dex for some atomic species. Three-dimensional corrections for the hydrides of C, N, and O are ∼0.5–1.0 dex, in the sense that 1D abundances are higher. We note also that LTE/NLTE and 1D/3D differences, determined independently, are not always necessarily in the same direction; and, thus, to some extent, the criticisms that apply to 1D/LTE results remain if only one of the two improvements has been made, as opposed to a complete 3D/NLTE analysis. In general the results of the more rigorous, but very computationally challenging, 3D/NLTE formalism are always to be preferred, if available. In what follows, unless otherwise stated, we present abundances from the more widely used 1D/LTE procedures, which have produced results for a much larger sample of stars. The rationale for this is that it is unwise to mix the results of the 1D/LTE and 3D/NLTE formalisms when investigating abundance trends and objects with apparently anomalous compositions. In contrast, one must bear in mind the problems that could occur if 1D/LTE abundances, rather than the more rigorous 3D/NLTE values, are compared with those of, for example, stellar evolution computations, other theoretical predictions, and nonstellar (e.g., Damped Lyα) systems.',\n",

Also shown, as reality checks, are two estimates of predicted lower limits below which one might not expect to find any star—for physical or technical reasons. The higher of the two limits is the prediction by Iben (1983) of [Fe/H] = −5.7 (assuming [Ca/Fe] = 0.3) as the putative surface value a zero heavy-element abundance star would acquire by accretion of the Galactic interstellar material over the past 10 Gyr, assuming a time-averaged accreted abundance of [Fe/H] = −0.6. Insofar as the Iben calculation is a back-of-the-envelope calculation, one should not be surprised that a star has been observed below this limit. The lower line, in contrast, is the more restrictive limit of Frebel & Norris (2013), which is the calcium abundance one might determine for a very low upper limit of the observed Caii K line strength of 20 mÅ in a putative metal-poor red giant having T\\neff=4, 500 K and log g = 0.5. [The Caii K line is the strongest atomic feature in the spectra of metal-poor stars (see \\nFigure 4\\n), and its strength is intrinsically greater in red giants than in near main-sequence dwarfs.] We make two further points about \\nFigure 3\\n. First, steady progress has been made over the past six decades to find stars with lower and lower metallicities (notwithstanding the one to two decade periods without progress). Second, we have most likely come to the point where further progress for identifying stars with lower abundances will be very slow. The spectrum of the most metal-poor star currently known, SM 0313−6708 (Keller et al. 2014) has [Ca/H] = −7.2, and no Fe lines have been observed. The only other elements so far detected are H, C, O, Mg, and Si; the strength of the Caii K line is a mere 90 mÅ. For comparison, the strength of this line in CD−38°245 (which has [Fe/H] = −4.0) is 1,485 mÅ.\\n',\n",

       "   'text': '\\nFrebel et al. (2007b) developed an observer-friendly formulation of early Cii and Oi metal line cooling (Bromm & Loeb 2003). They predicted that all metal-poor stars that formed through this mechanism should have carbon and/or oxygen abundances in excess of the line cooling critical metallicity. To date, all stars with [Fe/H] < −3.0 indeed show sufficiently enhanced levels of carbon and oxygen, with only one exception, SD 1029+1729 (see \\nTable 1\\n and Section 3.4). Instead, the existence of this star has been successfully explained in terms of a dust-cooling mechanism (Klessen et al. 2012, Schneider et al. 2012b, Ji et al. 2014). A more recent study has suggested that, even though both mechanisms may be important for forming the first low-mass stars, they may occur as part of separate formation pathways and/or environments (Ji et al. 2014). Detailed numerical simulations of star formation in atomic cooling halos have already suggested where these pathways may occur, although details so far remain unclear (Wise & Abel 2007, Greif et al. 2008, Ritter et al. 2012).',\n",

       "   'text': \"The Galactic latitude dependence of burst detection rates is of high interest because it would implicate propagation effects, especially interstellar scintillation (ISS), from the MW's ISM in the detectability of FRBs and estimated population sizes. However, the empirical evidence for latitude dependence is murky (Connor et al. 2016a). Early analyses suggested a deficit of mid-latitude FRBs that might be associated with the latitude dependence of ISS (Petroff et al. 2014, Macquart & Johnston 2015), which can more favorably enhance high-latitude detections. More recent analyses corroborate or assume a latitude dependence (Lawrence et al. 2017, Macquart & Ekers 2018b), whereas Bhandari et al. (2018) argue against it. This debate is based largely on studies of less than 20 objects from heterogeneous surveys. FRBs detected in directions through the Galactic plane do not seem to imply a low-latitude deficit. The repeating FRB 121102 (Spitler et al. 2014) and a new candidate FRB 141113 (Patel et al. 2018) were both found in the deep Arecibo pulsar survey, PALFA, covering a small field at low latitudes \\n\\n in the Galactic anticenter direction. Detection of the latter FRB implies a large rate if it was found in the main lobe of the telescope beam, \\n\\n, or a factor of ∼5 smaller rate if instead the burst was found in a sidelobe.

       "   'text': 'The one uniquely identified host galaxy for FRB 121102 is an irregular low-metallicity star-forming dwarf with a strong resemblance to the hosts of long-duration GRBs and SLSNe (Section 4), leading to a unified model for the source of the repeating bursts and the PRS as a young millisecond magnetar embedded in a nebula powered by its relativistic wind (Metzger et al. 2017, Margalit & Metzger 2018). If most FRBs come from repeating sources, Nicholl et al. (2017) find that a source association with GRBs or SLSNe and a burst emission lifetime of 30–300 years makes for a self-consistent picture. Although such a model has many attractive features, the PRS does resemble a typical AGN, and it has been established that dwarf galaxies can have massive BHs (Reines et al. 2011, Seth et al. 2014). The high (and time-varying) RM of the bursts, without a correspondingly large change in DM, argues for an extreme magneto-ionic environment similar to that of our GC (Michilli et al. 2018). Of course, one could require both circumstances (a very young magnetar in the environment of a massive BH) for (repeating) FRBs, a proposition difficult to rule out given a sample of one (as of February 2019).',\n",

       "   'text': \"Until recently, it has always been thought that circumbinary accretion leads to binary orbital decay. Pringle (1991) suggested that the strong gravitational torque from the binary on the CBD prevents accretion, and therefore the binary loses angular momentum to the disk (see Section 2). Gas accretion changes the picture completely. Only a few previous studies addressed the issue of angular momentum transfer in a quantitative way. Examples include MacFadyen & Milosavljević (2008) and Shi et al. (2012), whose simulations excise the inner cavity. MacFadyen & Milosavljević (2008) considered H/r = 0.1 and a disk viscosity with α = 0.01 and adopted a polar grid in the domain between r\\nin = a\\nb and r\\nout = 100a\\nb. They found a reduction of mass accretion onto the binary and the dominance of the gravitational torque relative to advective torque (therefore a negative net torque on the binary). However, with their small α parameter, the “viscous relaxation” radius at t = 4,000P\\nb (the typical duration of their runs) is only about 3a\\nb, and their surface density profile is far from steady state even at r ∼ r\\nin. So it is likely that the result of MacFadyen & Milosavljević (2008) reflects a “transient” phase of their simulations. Shi et al. (2012) obtained a positive value of \\n\\n in their 3D MHD simulations of CBDs (truncated at r\\nin = 0.8a\\nb). However, the duration of their simulations is only ∼100P\\nb, and it is unlikely that a quasi-steady state is reached. Their value of l\\n0, which is too small to cause orbital expansion, may not properly characterize the long-term evolution of the binary. Tang et al. (2017) carried out simulations of accretion onto circular binaries using DISCO (Duffell & MacFadyen 2012, Duffell 2016) with h = 0.1 and α = 0.1. For the accretion prescription, they assumed that inside a “sink” radius (measured from each “star”), the gas is depleted at a rate of dΣ/dt = −Σ/t\\nsink, with t\\nsink being a free parameter. They claimed that the net torque on the binary is negative unless t\\nsink is much less than P\\nb. This result is in contradiction with those of Muñoz et al. (2019) and Moody et al. (2019); the latter adopted a similar accretion prescription and did not find the same behavior as Tang et al. (2017). More recent works using DISCO (Duffell et al. 2020, D'Orazio & Duffell 2021, Dittmann & Ryan 2021) and the Cartesian-grid code Mara3 (Tiede et al. 2020, Zrake et al. 2021) have produced similar results as those of Muñoz et al. (2019, 2020) and Moody et al. (2019), so it appears that different groups have reached agreement (at least for disks with h = 0.1 and α = 0.1). See below for a discussion of the numerical resolution requirement to obtain reliable net torques.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Spatially resolving MBHBs at subparsec separations is difficult. The most compact, directly imaged MBHB on record is the dual AGNs in the radio galaxy 0402+379, with a projected separation of 7.3 pc (Rodriguez et al. 2006). For more compact sources, photometric and spectroscopic techniques can be used to infer the presence of MBHBs. Circumbinary accretion may prove crucial for upcoming multimessenger efforts to identify such compact MBHBs in the form of periodically varying electromagnetic (EM) counterparts (e.g., Bogdanović et al. 2022, Charisi et al. 2022). The sought-after periodic signals in time-variable AGNs include (a) time-variable kinematic offsets of the broad emission lines (Gaskell 1996), (b) Doppler-boosted broad-band emission from the circumsecondary accretion disk (D'Orazio et al. 2015), (c) periodic self-lensing flares (D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018, Hu et al. 2020), and (d) broadband photometric variability due to pulsed/modulated accretion (e.g., Tang et al. 2018). In practice, the kinematics approach is of limited use at subparsec because of the confusion and truncation of the distinct broad-line regions at these separations (Kelley 2021), making the photometric approach a more viable and data-rich technique (e.g., Charisi et al. 2022). Indeed, systematic searches for periodic signals in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (Graham et al. 2015), the Palomar Transient Factory (Charisi et al. 2016), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Liu et al. 2019b) have revealed hundreds of MBHB candidates. Measuring photometric variability is not exempt from systematic uncertainties (Graham et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016, Witt et al. 2022) but has the potential of being a powerful multimessenger tool in combination with simultaneous GW detections (Charisi et al. 2022). At subparsec separations, MBHBs emit GWs in the frequencies suitable for PTAs, which are forecast to provide individual binary detections within the next decade (Mingarelli et al. 2017, Kelley et al. 2018). In this regime, the binary orbit is still essentially Newtonian, and the associated GW waveforms are well understood. Likewise, the known photometric variability mechanisms (accretion/boosting/lensing) are all modulated on timescales commensurate with the binary orbit. Simultaneous GW/photometric detection of these objects would not only conclusively prove their existence but also allow for constraints on the their orbital parameters.\",\n",

       "   'text': \"Although this basic picture remains largely intact, multiwavelength observations over the past decade have increasingly revealed a nonthermal, shock-powered side to novae, which is providing new insights into old mysteries about these events. The shocks occur either as multiple phases of ejecta collide during the eruption or as the ejecta crash into a preexisting medium surrounding the binary. The continuum gamma-ray (≳100 MeV) emission observed by Fermi-LAT is clear evidence of the acceleration of relativistic particles by shocks (Martin & Dubus 2013). Shocks have also long been implied by X-ray observations of hot (∼107–108 K) presumably shock-heated gas in novae (O'Brien et al. 1994), observed weeks to months after eruption (Mukai et al. 2008). These X-rays might be absorbed earlier in the eruption and reprocessed into the ultraviolet–optical–infrared (UVOIR) bands, thus contributing to the optical light curve and its variability (Metzger et al. 2014, Li et al. 2017, Aydi et al. 2020b). Relativistic electrons accelerated at shocks also generate synchrotron radiation, sometimes seen as a distinct early component of radio emission (Taylor et al. 1987, Weston et al. 2016b, Finzell et al. 2018). Shock interaction may also play a crucial role in shaping the complex large-scale morphology of nova ejecta and may—via compression and hydrodynamical instabilities—generate the large densities and inhomogeneities needed for molecule and dust formation (Evans & Rawlings 2008, Derdzinski et al. 2017).\",\n",

       "   'text': 'Novae discovered early in their evolution are generally first seen during a photospheric or fireball phase, in which the nova envelope expands and the optical light curve rises, as the photosphere radius grows and the effective temperature decreases (Gehrz 1988, Hauschildt et al. 1994). This expansion is accompanied by the onset of mass loss, which is variously modeled as an impulsive shell ejection (e.g., Shore 2014, Mason et al. 2018), a continuous wind (Kato & Hachisu 1994), or a combination of the two (e.g., Friedjung 1987). As the nova transitions through optical maximum, most spectral lines show P Cygni profiles [e.g., \\n\\nFigure 4b\\n\\n\\n, subpanel i; see also the sidebar titled Transient Heavy-Element Absorption (THEA) Features]. With time, the emission component strengthens and the absorption weakens, which is consistent with a receding photosphere. Around maximum, the ejecta are dense enough to rapidly recombine, and the Str\\n\\nmgren sphere powered by the nuclear-burning WD is ionization bounded, such that the outer ejecta are neutral (Beck et al. 1990, Williams 1990). The dominant form of opacity is line blanketing by nearly neutral metals (sometimes called the iron curtain, because most of the opacity is from Fe lines; Shore & Aufdenberg 1993, Shore et al. 1994). Modeling of spectra before and around maximum finds that the density profiles of nova ejecta require a sharp outer profile (ρ ∝ r\\n−n\\n with n ≈ 15 for the outermost ejecta; Hauschildt et al. 1994) and a much shallower profile for the inner ejecta (n ≈ 3; Hauschildt et al. 1992). This density profile implies that the optical photospheric radius can vary by over a factor of ∼100 with wavelength and thereby sample a range of temperatures and ionization states (Hauschildt et al. 1995); it is therefore often called a pseudophotosphere.\\n',\n",

These data showed the widespread presence of P Cygni profiles in UV resonance lines, such as carbon iv, silicon iv, and nitrogen v, which were interpreted as stationary outflows that might be sufficiently strong to affect massive star evolution (Morton 1967, Lamers & Morton 1976).

The broad rings around AU Mic and HD 107146 both exhibit surface brightness profiles that increase steeply with radius at millimeter wavelengths (MacGregor et al. 2013, Ricci et al. 2015a), which is consistent with predictions for self-stirred debris disks (which include planetesimals but not necessarily any planets; Kenyon & Bromley 2002, Kennedy & Wyatt 2010), although the timescale required to assemble Pluto-size planetesimals and initiate a collisional cascade at the outer boundaries of these disks is longer than the age of the systems (Kenyon & Bromley 2008). The 49 Cet disk, by contrast, exhibits a deficit of millimeter emission at small radii, with a surface density profile that generally decreases with radius beyond ∼100 AU, extending to radii of more than 300 AU. Given similar difficulties with reconciling the age of the system with the timescale for self-stirring at such large radii, it is likely that at least some parts of the disk are stirred by planets or other mechanisms (Hughes et al. 2017). Narrow rings, however, may require multiple planets shepherding the inner and outer radii of the ring (e.g., Boley et al. 2012) or truncation by external perturbers (e.g., Nesvold et al. 2017), or they may be confined by mechanisms related to the interaction between gas and dust (e.g., Lyra & Kuchner 2013).',\n",

The asymmetric CO disks around β Pic and Fomalhaut both exhibit gas that closely traces the location of dust continuum emission in the system, enhancing the evidence for a common second-generation origin. The edge-on β Pic disk exhibits a weak asymmetry in dust continuum emission between the northeast and southwest disk limbs that is exaggerated in CO (Dent et al. 2014), whereas the location of the CO gas in Fomalhaut's eccentric dust ring corresponds at least approximately with the location of pericenter (Matrà et al. 2017b); however, the dust emission otherwise demonstrates no deviations from axisymmetry (MacGregor et al. 2017). Among the systems with generally axisymmetric gas disks, most that have been imaged at sufficiently high resolution seem to exhibit marked differences between the radial extent of the gas and dust emission (HD 21997, HD 141569, 49 Cet, \\n\\n Crv; Kóspál et al. 2013, White et al. 2016, Hughes et al. 2017, Marshall et al. 2017), although at least one—the only F star—exhibits cospatial gas and dust (HD 181327; Marino et al. 2016). Due to the coarse angular resolution of the survey by Lieman-Sifry et al.

The overall picture that emerges is therefore one in which asymmetric gas disks are observed to closely trace the parent dust distributions, as expected for a common second-generation origin, whereas the relationship between gas and dust in the systems with symmetric (and, typically, extended) gas disks is more ambiguous.\",\n",

       "   'text': 'How appropriate is it to ignore rotation and magnetism when computing stellar models? Both phenomena are closely related, and their importance for stellar evolution depends on the mass of the star. About 10% of intermediate- and high-mass stars have a detectable stable large-scale structured fossil magnetic field left from their formation and previous convective phases at the current threshold of Caii H & K absorption lines or spectropolarimetry based on Zeeman splitting (typically of a few Gauss; Donati & Landstreet 2009, Wade et al. 2016). This percentage agrees with the broad distribution of the measured spectroscopic projected equatorial surface rotation velocity, \\n\\n (e.g., Zorec & Royer 2012). The physical interpretation is that such stars are born without or with only a thin convective envelope, preventing the creation of a magnetic dynamo in their outer layers. In the absence of the latter, they do not experience a strong magnetized wind and therefore do not lose much angular momentum. Although stars born with a mass above some ∼15,Modot; do experience a considerable radiation-driven wind (Kudritzki & Puls 2000) and lose angular momentum efficiently, most stars with \\n\\nM⊙ roughly keep their original J received at birth during the main sequence. Aside from these considerations for the stellar envelope, high- and intermediate-mass stars may have a magnetic dynamo in their convective core region. The strength and properties of such an interior field cannot be measured directly, as it is shielded by the extended overlying radiative envelope. Indirect evidence of the existence of interior fields, with strengths above ∼105 Gauss, was deduced from depressed dipole modes found in Kepler data of hundreds of red giants (Fuller et al. 2015, Cantiello et al. 2016). If these dipole modes undergo suppression by an interior magnetic field in the radiative core, then such a field must occur in about half of the progenitor main-sequence stars (Stello et al. 2016). However, Mosser et al. (2017) argue that mixed modes (i.e., modes with a g-mode character that are not pure p modes) are still detected in these stars and, hence, cannot be fully suppressed in their radiative core. Mosser et al. (2017) postulate the strongly reduced amplitudes of the dipole modes to be due to a yet unknown damping effect. Ongoing research approaches this topic from a complementary angle: The hypothesis that half of the progenitors of red giants must have a strong interior magnetic field in their convective core with properties derived by Cantiello et al. (2016), as deduced by Stello et al. (2016), is currently being tested from the effect of the acting Coriolis and Lorentz forces on the frequencies of detected gravity modes in intermediate-mass stars. Irrespective of the future outcome of this ongoing debate, the best approach for asteroseismology is to ignore core and surface magnetism in the computation of equilibrium models for the mass range of \\n\\nM⊙ and to focus on rotation as the prime cause of complexity in 1D stellar models (e.g., Georgy et al. 2013) and in asteroseismology (Buysschaert et al. 2018). Additional attention must be given to mass loss for \\n\\nM⊙.',\n",

By combining their rotationally split p modes with a high-precision spectroscopic measurement of \\n\\n and stellar models or with the frequency of rotational modulation detected in the Kepler data, Benomar et al. (2015) and Nielsen et al. (2017) achieved the envelope and surface rotation rates of 27 such single stars, covering a mass range from 1.0 to 1.6 M⊙. This revealed nearly uniform radial envelope rotation with average rotation values covering \\n\\nHz for the sample, in agreement with the spectroscopic \\n\\n values. By contrast, Benomar et al. (2018) studied latitudinal differential rotation in 40 low-mass main-sequence stars in this mass range and found 13 of these to reveal significantly slower polar than equatorial rotation, a phenomenon that also occurs for the Sun (Thompson et al. 2003). Asteroseismic inversions to derive the latitudinal rotation law in the envelope, \\n\\n, revealed the magnitude of the angular differentiality to be larger than that for the Sun, with latitudinal shear factors between the equator and at midlatitude ranging from −1.4 to −0.27 (Benomar et al. 2018, their table S3). Such a level of observed latitudinal shear is much larger than predictions from theory and numerical simulations for the Sun and solar-like stars (Hotta et al. 2015, Brun et al. 2017). Although the 13 stars have faster average envelope rotation than the Sun, with \\n\\nHz when adopting a latitudinal rotation law as for the Sun, the asteroseismic inference of these shear values points to large anisotropy in the turbulence, accompanied by efficient angular momentum transport. These asteroseismic results remain unexplained so far. Such a level of shear is not found from the 3D numerical simulations for red giants by Brun & Palacios (2009), who derived antisolar latitudinal differential rotation and strong radial differential rotation in the slowly rotating outer envelope, as it would occur from conservation of specific angular momentum by individual convective flows. Major theoretical uncertainty in the level of radial differentiality of the rotation in convection zones remains for low-mass red giants (e.g., Kissin & Thompson 2015).',\n",

       "   'text': \"The dynamical measurements from AO images allowed the derivation of the mass of the central object with a few percent accuracy. The motion of the stars follow almost perfect Keplerian orbits, even for stars like S2 that passes the central source as close as \\n\\n (Schwarzschild radius: R\\nS = 2GM/c\\n2). Following the pericenter passage of S2 in 2002, it became clear that the first-order general relativity (GR) effects will come in reach with precision observations (Rubilar & Eckart 2001). Despite the fact that a black hole is a genuine prediction of GR, the signatures of GR on the stellar orbits with the leading post-Newtonian terms (O(β2), β = v/c), namely gravitational redshift and Schwarzschild precession, are small perturbations w.r.t. the Keplerian motion (for a review, see Alexander 2005). The gravitational redshift scales with β2 ≈ R\\nS/R. In case of S2, the effect is approximately \\n\\n compared to the maximum velocity of \\n\\n at pericenter passage. The Schwarzschild precession rotates the elliptical orbit by ≈12.1 arcmin per 16 years revolution. In order to measure the effects, a significant improvement (by a factor of 4–10) in astrometry compared to what was possible in 2010 was needed. This posed one of the main science drivers for the development of the GRAVITY instrument (Eisenhauer et al. 2008, Paumard et al. 2008). Since its first light (GRAVITY Collab. et al. 2017a), GRAVITY has been regularly observing the central S-stars and SgrA\\\\*. On May 19, 2018, S2 passed pericenter with 2.6% of the speed of light. By simultaneously monitoring the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2018a) were able to detect the gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect at high significance (later confirmed by Do et al. 2019). The statistical robustness of the redshift detection was further improved by GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2019a) to more than 20σ significance. Amorim et al. (2019) used two atomic transition lines in the spectrum of S2 to test one pillar of the Einstein equivalence principle and, thus, GR and the local position invariance (LPI). By separately measuring the redshift of the hydrogen and helium lines in the stellar spectrum, effectively two independent clocks can be probed, while moving through the black hole's gravitational potential. The results set an upper limit on a violation of the LPI of 5 × 10−2 for a change of potential that is six magnitudes larger than accessible with terrestrial experiments.\",\n",

Subsequent observational work confirmed that this is the dominant impact of intrinsic alignments on weak lensing measurements; but it cannot be eliminated by removing galaxy pairs at the same redshift from the lensing sample. Based on recent observations (e.g., Singh & Mandelbaum 2016), intrinsic alignments will be an important systematic that surveys like LSST must mitigate (\\nFigure 7\\n). Efforts to remove this systematic typically include modeling or self-calibration in a joint cosmological analysis of galaxy–galaxy, galaxy–shear, and shear–shear correlations (DES Collab. et al. 2017, Joudaki et al. 2018, Yao et al. 2017).

This event was followed 1.74 ± 0.05 s later by a burst of γ-rays detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM; Goldstein et al. 2017) and INTEGRAL SPI-ACS (the anti-coincidence system of spectrometer SPI on the International Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory; Savchenko et al. 2017). The subsequent detection of an optical counterpart to GW170817 and GRB 170817A was first made by the One-Meter Two-Hemispheres collaboration using the Swope Telescope at 10.9 h after the merger (Coulter et al. 2017), and within the next hour five other teams independently detected the same source, now known as AT 2017gfo (see the sidebar titled Nomenclature; Arcavi et al. 2017, Lipunov et al. 2017, Soares-Santos et al. 2017, Tanvir et al. 2017, Valenti et al. 2017).

The shock-heated dynamical ejecta can reach sufficiently high velocities to be consistent with the early optical spectra and can be lanthanide poor (Wanajo et al. 2014), but the ejecta masses from this mechanism appear to be too low (≲0.01 M\\n⊙) unless the NS radius is very small (Oechslin et al. 2007, Bauswein et al. 2013, Hotokezaka et al. 2013).

Although EM observations of GW170817 offer no conclusive evidence, and a long-lived or stable NS cannot be entirely ruled out on EM and GW grounds (e.g., Abbott et al. 2017b, 2020b; Piro et al. 2019; Troja et al. 2020), the presence of a blue kilonova component associated with a large mass of lanthanide-free ejecta and \\n\\n (Section 4), together with a successful relativistic jet (Section 5), strongly disfavors a prompt collapse to a BH and argues in favor of an HMNS that collapsed to a BH within a second or so after merger (Granot et al. 2017, Margalit & Metzger 2017, Shibata et al. 2017, Metzger et al. 2018, Rezzolla et al. 2018, Gill et al. 2019b, Ciolfi 2020, Murguia-Berthier et al. 2021). Finally, there is no significant EM observational evidence for long-lived (t > T\\n90) central engine activity in the form of accretion onto a BH or spin down of a rapidly rotating NS (Abbott et al. 2017b, Pooley et al. 2018, Hajela et al. 2019; Section 5.4). EM and GW observations of GW170817 strongly motivate improvements to the high-frequency sensitivity of GW interferometers to directly probe the outcome of the merger and accurately map EM signatures to the properties of their compact remnants.',\n",

For the cosmologist, the IGM has been used to test our models of structure formation on the smallest comoving scales (Viel et al. 2005, Seljak et al. 2005), it induces anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB; Ostriker & Vishniac 1986, Hu 2000), and the astrophysical processes that shape the IGM can bias cosmological parameter inferences from galaxy clustering (Pritchard et al. 2007, Wyithe & Dijkstra 2011). For the large community interested in galaxy formation, the IGM is the trough from which galaxies feed, setting the minimum mass of galaxies (Rees 1986, Efstathiou 1992, Thoul & Weinberg 1996) and feeding some galaxies more than others (e.g., Kereš et al. 2005). In addition, the IGM can be used to measure the total ionizing photon production of galaxies (Haardt & Madau 1996, Miralda-Escudé 2003, Faucher-Giguère et al. 2008b, Becker & Bolton 2013) as well as galaxies' stellar nucleosynthetic yield, as a large fraction is ejected into the IGM (e.g., Peeples et al. 2014). For those who focus on our own Milky Way, aside from the obvious connection that the Milky Way too is fed by the same intergalactic spigot, we note that many of the physical processes at play in the IGM are simplified versions of those encountered in the interstellar medium (ISM).\",\n",

Temperature measurements are interesting because they constrain different energy injection processes into the IGM and because the IGM temperature sets the minimum mass of galaxies (see the sidebar The Minimum Mass of Galaxies). Temperature measurements rely on the width of Lyα absorption features from the low-density IGM being broader with higher temperatures, because of both thermal broadening and, to a lesser extent, the broadening owing to pressure effects. A variety of methods to determine temperature are used, ranging from directly fitting for the width of absorption lines as a function of N\\nHI (Schaye et al. 1999) to measuring the suppression at high wavenumbers in the Lyα forest power spectrum that owes principally to thermal broadening (Theuns et al. 2000, Zaldarriaga et al. 2001). All methods must be calibrated with simulations. The spate of IGM temperature measurements near the turn of the century generally found fairly high temperatures over the range 2<z<4, with temperatures at the mean density of T\\n0=(20–30)×103K, although with a large amount of scatter and large statistical errors of ∼(5–10)×103 K. Recent measurements have led to a more concordant picture with T\\n0=(10–20)×103 K, with the concordance arising because of the general agreement among several studies (Becker et al. 2011, Garzilli et al. 2012, Boera et al. 2014, Bolton et al. 2014; albeit with significant collaborative overlap) and with the past study by Schaye et al. (2000). In addition, led by Becker et al. (2011), some studies have chosen to estimate the temperature at the density where the variance in the estimate is minimized rather than at Δ\\nb\\n=1, resulting in smaller errors. However, there is still some tension among recent measurements (Lidz et al. 2010, Becker et al. 2011).',\n",

This observable has the potential to yield vastly more information about reionization than any other probe (and, with additional effort, the ages that preceded reionization; Furlanetto et al. 2006, Morales & Wyithe 2010, Pritchard & Loeb 2012). Although in principle the 21-cm signal provides a tomographic image of reionization like that shown in \\nFigure 11\\n, the first generations of instruments do not have the sensitivity to make images, and we must hope instead to achieve statistical detections of the signal (McQuinn et al. 2006, although see Zaroubi et al. 2012). There is a worldwide effort to detect the z∼6–10 21-cm signal using both specialized and multipurpose interferometers, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, the Precision Array to Probe Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) primarily in the Netherlands, and the 21-cm Array in China (with planning underway for the next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) instrument and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low in South Africa and Australia, respectively; Paciga et al. 2013, van Haarlem et al. 2013, DeBoer et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2015, Dillon et al. 2015, Koopmans et al. 2015). With the exception of the Netherlands, these locations have been chosen to be as isolated as possible from anthropogenic radio transmissions that can easily contaminate this signal, a signal that from z=6–10 falls in the well-trafficked 130–210 MHz band. There are also efforts afoot attempting to detect the sky-averaged (or global) 21-cm signal from z=6–30 (Bowman & Rogers 2010, Burns et al. 2012, Bernardi et al. 2015).

       "   'text': 'All galaxies formed stars in early cosmological times, and in general the SFR was higher in the past both in individual galaxies (e.g., Heavens et al. 2004, Speagle et al. 2014) and averaged over the entire population (e.g., Madau & Dickinson 2014). However, at low redshift and at least up to z ∼ 1, galaxies present a clear bimodality regarding their SFRs: (a) those that are more actively forming stars [defined broadly as star-forming galaxies (SFGs)], and (b) those that present little or no star-forming activity [defined broadly as passive, quenched, or retired galaxies (RGs); e.g., Stasińska et al. (2008)]. These two groups are well separated in different diagrams that compare either the current SFR or proxies of the age of the stellar population with the integrated stellar mass or absolute magnitude, like the SFR versus mass diagram (SFR–M\\n\\\\*, e.g., Renzini & Peng 2015), the color–magnitude diagram (e.g., Bell et al. 2004), or the D4000–mass diagram (e.g., Blanton & Moustakas 2009; where D4000 is an age tracer). In addition, this bimodality is strongly correlated with the morphological, structural, and dynamical properties of the galaxies (e.g., Drory & Fisher 2007, Blanton & Moustakas 2009, Graham et al. 2018). In general, SFGs are late-type galaxies (LTGs) and disk dominated (e.g., Brinchmann et al. 2004), whereas RGs are usually early type and bulge dominated (e.g., Drory & Fisher 2007). Additionally, we know that the masses of early-type galaxies at low redshift have grown by at least a factor of two in the past ∼8 Gyr (e.g., Bell et al. 2006); however, they show little or no significant SF during the same time period (e.g., López Fernández et al. 2018, Sánchez et al. 2019a). This implies that there should be a population of galaxies transitioning from SFGs to RGs. This event may last only a few gigayears, and it involves profound morphological and structural transformation of those galaxies, as well as dramatic aging of their average stellar populations. Broadly speaking, this process is known as quenching or rapid halting of SF activity (e.g., Casado et al. 2015, Saintonge et al. 2016). Beside that dramatic process, current SFGs have steadily decreased their SFRs along the same time period, showing slightly older stellar populations on average—it is a smooth process generally known as aging (e.g., Casado et al. 2015).',\n",

       "   'text': 'The distribution of SFGs is well characterized by a log-linear, tight relation, observed between the SFR and M\\n\\\\*. This relation, known as the star-formation main sequence (SFMS) of galaxies, has been well studied using both single-aperture and IFS data at low redshift (e.g., Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007, Catalán-Torrecilla et al. 2015, Gavazzi et al. 2015, Renzini & Peng 2015, Cano-Díaz et al. 2016, Sánchez et al. 2018). In general, the SFMS has a scatter of ∼0.2–0.3 dex in SFR at any redshift, with a slope slightly smaller than one at low redshift, ∼0.8 dex/log(M\\n\\\\*). The SFMS presents a clear evolution in the zero point that increases with redshift (e.g., Speagle et al. 2014, Rodríguez-Puebla et al. 2016). By contrast, RGs are distributed well below the SFMS, following a loose relation with the M\\n\\\\* (or a cloud), broadly corresponding to the location expected for an EW(Hα) ∼ 1 Å (e.g., Stasińska et al. 2008). In between the two groups, there is an area with a much lower number density of galaxies, known as the green valley (GV). Galaxies in the GV (or GVGs) are considered in transit between SFGs and RGs, and their limited number has been interpreted as a consequence of a fast process transforming the former to the latter (e.g., Bell et al. 2004, Faber et al. 2007, Schiminovich et al. 2007). More recently, AGN hosts were found located in the GV of the SFR–M\\n\\\\* diagram (e.g., Torres-Papaqui et al. 2012, Schawinski et al. 2014, Cano-Díaz et al. 2016, Sánchez et al. 2018), as shown in \\nFigure 2\\n. Actually, their distribution is spread from the SFMS toward the RGs cloud, covering mostly the GV, and sharing many properties with GVGs (e.g., Sánchez et al. 2018).

The Starburst99 (Leitherer et al. 1999) model grid has recently incorporated a prescription for the inclusion of a limited range of binary evolutionary pathways (Götberg et al. 2019), and also allows use of the Geneva library of rotating star atmosphere models (Ekström et al. 2012, Leitherer et al. 2014). Binary spectral synthesis requires a significantly larger grid of stellar evolution models. Publicly released binary spectral synthesis models are limited to the Yunnan models of Zhang et al.

Wherever possible we have shown average measurements based on large samples of objects, and we quote the ξion,0 as calibrated by the original authors. Where no data for f\\nesc were provided, we assume f\\nesc = 0 (a number of authors themselves assume this). Measurements of this quantity have, perhaps naturally, been concentrated on the most highly ionizing and highly luminous objects at a given redshift—indeed those taken in the very distant Universe are only possible for extremely powerful emission line galaxies. They have also been obtained for samples obtained through a variety of selection methods, which produce overlapping samples. For clarity, in \\nFigure 4b\\n\\n we attempt to classify the samples into four broad categories. The designated “High EW” symbols show reported sample means for galaxies selected as very luminous examples of narrowband or spectroscopically selected emission line galaxies (typically Hα emitters at cosmic noon and Lyα emitters at high redshift) (Stark et al. 2017; Matthee et al. 2018, 2021; De Barros et al. 2019; Maseda et al. 2020). “EELGs” symbols indicate galaxies selected as extreme emission line galaxies either on the basis of broadband photometry excesses or directly through spectroscopy (EELGs) (Schaerer et al. 2016; Berg et al. 2018, 2019; Chisholm et al. 2019; Onodera et al. 2020). “LyC or high [Oiii]/[Oii]” symbols show samples of galaxies identified as Lyman continuum leakers (i.e., with a measured high f\\nesc) or as having very high [Oiii]/[Oii] ratios (Schaerer et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019, 2021; Guseva et al. 2020).

The bulk density of Patroclus and Hector, both Jupiter's Trojans, was determined to be ρ=0.8–1 g cm−3 (Marchis et al. 2014, Buie et al. 2015), which is suggestive of high H2O-ice content and/or high porosity. The Patroclus and (18974) 1998 WR21 equal-size binaries are probably rare survivors of a much larger population of binaries in the outer disk (most binaries were presumably dissociated by collisions and planetary encounters).

       "   'text': 'The luminosity of supernovae (SNe) was the defining feature of these remarkable stellar events and set these apart from less luminous and much more common stellar eruptions such as classical novae. Observed SN populations are invariably dominated by Type Ia events, which are the most luminous of all common SNe (e.g., Gal-Yam et al. 2013). Analyzing the statistics of peak SN luminosities, Richardson et al. (2002) noted a population of rare, overluminous events that are significantly more luminous than SNe Ia (\\n\\n erg s−1; \\n\\n). Following the discovery and detailed studies of a few nearby superluminous events [particularly SN 2005ap (Quimby et al. 2007), SN 2006gy (Ofek et al. 2007, Smith et al. 2007), and SN 2007bi (Gal-Yam et al. 2009)], this population has become a focus of intense study. In particular, Quimby et al. (2011) used observations across a range of redshift in order to unify several fragmented reports and define a spectroscopic class of hydrogen-poor superluminous events. Gal-Yam (2012) reviewed extant observation, provided a detailed historical review, set a fiducial threshold to consider an event as a superluminous supernova (SLSN), and introduced the subclasses of hydrogen-poor (SLSN-I) and hydrogen-rich (SLSN-II) events. More recently, this class of objects was reviewed by Howell (2017) and by Gal-Yam (2017) in the context of SN classification, whereas Moriya et al. (2018) provide a broad theoretical perspective. The goal of this review is to update and expand on the work of Gal-Yam (2012), using a substantially larger data set collected since; 115 SLSNe are currently listed on WISeREP (Yaron & Gal-Yam 2012), a sample >5 times larger than the 18 events available for analysis in 2012.',\n",

(2017) presented a weak bump that was evident in early observations of PTF12dam, as well as an extreme early bump in the light curve of iPTF13dcc. Early bumps for which color information exists indicate the emission is initially very hot (∼25,000 K) and cools rapidly (Nicholl & Smartt 2016, Smith et al. 2016; see \\nFigure 5\\n). Bump durations range from about 10 d to several weeks, and bump luminosities extend from about −19 mag to above −21 mag for the extreme iPTF13dcc, making these bumps brighter than almost all normal SNe and, in some cases, rivaling the main peak of SLSNe in flux and duration. Nicholl & Smartt (2016) undertook a systematic search for such early bumps in the light curves of a literature sample of SLSNe-I. They find evidence for plausible early bumps in 8 of the 14 events with relevant early data and cannot rule out the existence of such a bump in any of the events, suggesting that these bumps may be common or even ubiquitous in SLSNe-I. However, the recent, nearby SN 2018bsz seems to lack a distinct bump, showing instead a long, slowly rising early plateau (Anderson et al. 2018); and the sample of SLSNe from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) also shows that significant early bumps are not ubiquitous (C.

Large-scale structure measurements can be performed either by simply measuring angular clustering in photo-z slices (e.g., Sánchez et al. 2011, Carnero et al. 2012, DES Collab. 2021b) or, for more sensitive results, by using photo-z estimates (or PDFs) for individual objects (e.g., Padmanabhan et al. 2007, Seo et al. 2012, Zhou et al. 2021). The observed amplitude of angular clustering will depend directly on the redshift distribution of the galaxy sample. As was the case for clustering-based studies of galaxy evolution, increasing the performance of photo-zs will improve the SNR for cosmological large-scale structure studies. Characterization of the width of the ensemble redshift distribution is particularly important for minimizing systematic uncertainties in measurements of the clustering amplitude (e.g., Cawthon et al. 2020), while characterization of the mean redshift will be more important for constraints on the BAO distance scale.',\n",

Even 45 years later, this seminal work remains the primary basis of our understanding of accretion onto black holes in X-ray binaries (XRBs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and we refer to this as the standard model of accretion disks.

       "   'text': 'The response to the tilt of thinner disks is qualitatively different than it is to that of thick disks. In fact, when the disk thickness is smaller than the disk viscosity parameter, h/r < α, warps propagate in the disks viscously. Bardeen & Petterson (1975) predicted that this would lead to the inner parts of the accretion disk aligning with the black hole midplane and separating from the outer, misaligned part of the disk by a smooth warp (the Bardeen–Petterson effect or BP). However, at the time it was impossible to take into account the magnetized turbulence responsible for the accretion. And, though such alignment was seen in nonrelativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations (e.g., Nelson & Papaloizou 2000), general relativistic magnetized simulations of tilted disks, as thin as h/r = 0.08, have shown no sign of the BP alignment (Zhuravlev et al. 2014). Liska et al. (2019c) simulated the thinnest disk, with h/r = 0.03, tilted by 10 degrees relative to a rapidly spinning black hole, and found that the inner regions of the disk, r\\n\\n\\n 5r\\ng, aligned with the black hole. This remarkable discovery is the first demonstration of BP alignment in a general relativistic numerical simulation of a magnetized accretion disk. Importantly, the duration of these simulations is long enough for the inner regions of the accretion disk to achieve inflow equilibrium and quasi–steady state. The BP alignment was also seen in shorter nonrelativistic simulations that approximated the effects of black hole rotation via additional torques in MHD equations (Hawley & Krolik 2019) and did not include the effects of apsidal precession, which can qualitatively affect the alignment process (Nealon et al. 2016).',\n",

       "   'text': '\\nDe Vaucouleurs (1964) first suggested a barred Bulge in the MW from the high gas velocities in the central Galaxy. The existence of the bar was put on firm grounds in the 1990s, from modeling the noncircular gas motions in the Bulge region (Binney et al. 1991, Englmaier & Gerhard 1999, Fux 1999); near-IR data, in particular from the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) satellite (Blitz & Spergel 1991, Weiland et al. 1994, Binney et al. 1997); and red clump giant (RCG) star counts (Stanek et al. 1994). Modern data have confirmed the Bulge to have a box/peanut (B/P) shape typical for barred galaxies. With star counts at high latitudes, it was discovered that the Bulge has an X-shaped component (McWilliam & Zoccali 2010, Nataf et al. 2010), which is a manifestation of a B/P bulge as later demonstrated by the reconstruction of the three-dimensional (3D) Bulge density (Wegg & Gerhard 2013) from VVV (Vista Variables in the Via Lactea) data (see \\n\\nTable 1\\n\\n). Because B/P bulges are the inner 3D parts of a longer, flatter bar in the disk (e.g., Bureau & Freeman 1999, Athanassoula 2005, Erwin & Debattista 2013), the definition of “the Bulge” has become somewhat blurred, also affecting estimates of the Bulge mass (see Section 2). General practice is to use a region on the sky with size ±10° in both longitude and latitude (l, b), which, however, poses the problem of separating Bulge stars from foreground and background disk stars.\\n',\n",

At large ages, very massive brown dwarfs can develop small conductive cores (Lunine et al. 1986, Chabrier et al. 2000), but this is far below the atmosphere. Because convection in these dense atmospheres is very efficient, the gradient in the deep thermal temperature profiles, ∇=dlogT/dlogP, is expected to closely follow convective adiabats (i.e., thermal profiles of constant entropy), with ∇=∇ad (Baraffe et al. 2002).

The usual approximation used in modeling this process is that the atmospheric abundance of CO is fixed at the point at which the chemical equilibrium timescale is equal to the mixing timescale, commonly known as the quench approximation (e.g., Fegley & Lodders 1996, Saumon et al. 2000, Lodders & Fegley 2002, Hubeny & Burrows 2007; see the sidebar, Quenching).

Careful selection of lines would favor ionized lines, for which LTE holds better, and high excitation potential lines, for which 1D modeling is more accurate.

With the advent of space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT that provide high-quality photometric data over a long time series, it has now become feasible to detect solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of stars (Stello et al. 2013, 2015). Typically, the power spectrum of a star with solar-like oscillations (\\nFigure 10) shows a regular pattern of modes, characterized by a large frequency separation Δν. The overall amplitude is modulated by a Gaussian envelope, and this is characterized by the frequency of maximum oscillation νmax. Theory suggests that Δν for a given star is related to its density (Ulrich 1986), whereas the νmax is related to its surface gravity and temperature (Brown et al. 1991, Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). Using the above two relations, the mass and the radius of a star can be constrained. The mass of a red giant is sensitive to its age, and this makes asteroseismology very useful for understanding Galactic evolution (Chaplin et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2016).

       "   'text': 'Combining spatially resolved data with spectroscopy can provide information on individual closed coronal structures, the so-called coronal loops (see Reale 2014). When observed in X-rays, the loops were initially found to be long-lived and to have densities and temperatures consistent with steady, uniform heating (e.g., Porter & Klimchuk 1995). However, this result was challenged by observations made at EUV wavelengths (Klimchuk et al. 2010). The densities of the loops are as many as three orders of magnitude larger than predicted by steady heating (e.g., Winebarger et al. 2003a), and the observed pressure stratification does not agree with the expected gravitational scale height (e.g., Aschwanden et al. 2001). In addition, the temperatures along the loops are more uniform than predicted by steady heating (Lenz et al. 1999). Though the loops appear to be relatively cool (Viall & Klimchuk 2012), the loops’ lifetimes are longer than expected for models of radiative and conductive cooling (Winebarger et al. 2003b). Finally, many loops exhibit bulk flows (e.g., Winebarger et al. 2002) and values of the nonthermal velocity (e.g., Brooks & Warren 2016) that do not appear to match those expected for several simple models of uniform heating. We discuss some of the physical processes underlying these phenomena in Section 5.5.',\n",

       "   'text': 'In the weakly magnetized internetwork regions of the Sun (i.e., supergranular cell centers), there is still no agreement about whether the dissipation of acoustic fluctuations is strong enough on its own to heat the chromosphere. Existing observations have sometimes pointed to an affirmative answer (Cuntz et al. 2007, Bello González et al. 2010) and sometimes to a negative answer (Carlsson et al. 2007, Beck et al. 2012). Numerical simulations can reproduce much of the observed structure and time-dependent dynamics in the nonmagnetic chromosphere (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). However, many simulations tend to produce a highly intermittent state, i.e., hot shocks surrounded by larger regions that may be too dark and cool to produce the steady emission seen in many chromospheric spectral lines (Kalkofen 2012). No matter the role of acoustic waves/shocks in the chromospheric energy budget, their dissipation tends not to leave much power available at larger heights to heat the corona (Athay & White 1978, Cranmer et al. 2007). Thus, in recent years the focus has shifted heavily to magnetic fields and MHD fluctuations as a primary heating mechanism for both the chromosphere (Jess et al. 2015) and corona (Section 5.3).',\n",

       "   'text': \"\\nAbbot et al. (2012) discussed how a carbonate-silicate cycle could be maintained with up to 95% of a planet's surface covered by water, suggesting by extrapolation a possible CO2 cycling for Type 2 waterworlds via the rocky ocean floor. Such planet models show a varying timescale for a carbon cycle, depending on their initial carbon inventory and temperature (Foley 2015). However, for Type 1 waterworlds, that is, super-Earths with water mass fractions like those of Earth or higher, the deep oceans are separated from the rocky interior via a layer of high-pressure ices. Therefore, an alternative mechanism to modulate abundant gases like CO2 and CH4 would be required in waterworlds. Such a mechanism would depend on the properties of their clathration in water over a range of very high pressures. Under very high pressures (above 0.6 GPa), common to super-Earth-sized water planets, clathrates undergo a phase transition in their structure to a form known as filled ice that can transport CH4 and CO2 (Levi et al. 2013, 2017). This should enable effective cycling of CO2 through the atmosphere and oceans on water planets residing in the HZ (e.g., with water oceans at the surface) and thus provide an alternative atmospheric concentration feedback mechanism to regulate CO2 on water planets. The timescales and effectiveness of such cycling is still an open question (Kitzmann et al. 2015, Levi et al. 2017). A lively debate in the literature addresses how the interiors of such worlds might work, regarding the ability to cycle gases from the rocky core to the atmosphere (Valencia et al. 2007; Grasset et al. 2009; Fu et al. 2010; Rogers & Seager 2010; Kaltenegger et al. 2013; Tackley et al. 2013; Levi et al. 2013, 2017) and whether such planets could be habitats (Abbot 2016, Abbot et al. 2012, Kaltenegger et al. 2013, Noack et al. 2016). First analyses of what atmospheric spectra of waterworlds might look like and whether they could be distinguished from land-dominated worlds even in transit, where surface albedo would not be detectable, depend strongly on whether long-term CO2 cycling can be maintained (Kaltenegger et al. 2013).\",\n",

       "   'text': 'The opening of ALMA in 2012 heralded a leap forward in the understanding of wind morphologies. Observational evidence was steadily accumulating that AGB and RSG winds exhibit large correlated density structures—including arcs, shells, bipolar structures, tori, rotating disks, and spirals—embedded in a smooth, radially outflowing wind (see \\nFigure 7\\n) (Maercker et al. 2012; Ramstedt et al. 2014, 2018; Decin et al. 2015, 2019; Kim et al. 2015; Kervella et al. 2016; Wong et al. 2016; Bujarrabal et al. 2018; Guélin et al. 2018; Homan et al. 2018a,b; Randall et al. 2020). At the same time, we saw a revival of hydrodynamical simulations for binary systems in which the primary is a mass-losing AGB star. Depending on the parameters of the system—such as binary separation, mass ratio, eccentricity, rotation and pulsations of the AGB star, mass-loss rate, wind velocity, etc.—a wide variety of morphologies is predicted, including the following: (a) a spiral structure caused by the orbital motion of the mass-losing AGB star around the common center of mass, or by the accretion wake of the companion owing to a BHL flow (see \\nFigure 8\\n) that can be bifurcated for a noncircular orbit; (b) a circumbinary disk; (c) an accretion disk around the secondary; (d) a bipolar outflow that can display ripple-like structures if the AGB pulsations are included; (e) an equatorial density enhancement (EDE), with a regular (Keplerian) or complex velocity vector field; and (f) even spider or rose-like structures (see \\nFigure 7\\n; Kim & Taam 2012, Chen et al. 2017, Liu et al. 2017, Saladino et al. 2018, Saladino & Pols 2019, Kim et al. 2019, Chen et al. 2020, El Mellah et al. 2020). In general, smaller values of the orbital separation or wind velocity and larger companion masses induce stronger interaction. These outcomes can be formally expressed in a way similar to Equation 13 or Equation 16, although it is obviously seen that the number of independent parameters is far larger. Therefore, the amount of studies in which the model sensitivities can be tested for a large grid of parameters is still very restricted by the huge demand on CPU time and memory required.\\n',\n",

       "   'text': \"Assuming the monomers are present, the full kinetic models of Boulangier et al. (2019) favor Al2O3 as the primary dust precursor candidate owing to the high temperature at which nucleation can occur (∼1,800 K). However, if one starts from an atomic mixture, an acute problem arises because the concentration of the Al2O3 monomer is almost negligible in the relevant temperature range, and most of the aluminum is in the atomic form. These results suggest that among the possible candidates, TiO2 clusters are the only possible dust precursors. However, the kinetic temperature corresponding to the spatial regions where dust is found is roughly 1,500–2,000 K (Norris et al. 2012, Khouri et al. 2016), well above the formation temperature of (TiO2)\\nN\\n = 10, which is around 1,000–1,200 K. Furthermore, a significantly larger fraction of presolar grains of AGB origin contain Al2O3 rather than TiO2 grains (Choi et al. 1998, Stroud et al. 2004, Bose et al. 2010), although the expected smaller size of TiO2 grains makes them more difficult to detect. So, alternative routes are now being explored to determine whether larger (Al2O3)\\nn\\n clusters can form bypassing the monomer, and using, for example, the (Al2O3)2 dimer as the main building block, where the dimer is formed from oxidation reactions of the abundant Al2O2 molecule with AlO, AlOH, OH, and H2O (D. Gobrecht, J. Plane, and L. Decin, in preparation). Another possibility might be that large clusters can exist at higher kinetic temperatures than currently suggested by the model calculations, because of thermo-ionic electron emission (Demyk et al. 2004), or possibly radiative cooling (potentially via recurrent fluorescence or vibrational radiative cooling) rather than dissociating. The Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman (1959) famously used as the title of his talk presented to the American Physical Society in Pasadena on December 29, 1959, There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.

       "   'question': ' How can interference substructures in fuzzy dark matter halos be detected through gravitational lensing effects?',\n",
       "   'text': 'One generic prediction of wave dark matter is the existence of interference substructures in halos. These are de Broglie scale, order unity density fluctuations. The fluctuation can take the density all the way to zero (complete destructive interference, i.e., vortices; see Section 3.4). There are different ways to probe these interference substructures. One is through the heating and scattering of stars, already discussed in Section 4.3.2. The other is through gravitational lensing by the substructures. For instance, a de Broglie–sized blob in our own Galaxy passing over the line of sight to some distant object would cause the apparent position of that object to shift (Weiner 2019, Hui et al. 2021, Mishra-Sharma et al. 2020, Mondino et al. 2020). The effect is small—Mishra-Sharma et al. (2020) proposed the correlated shifts of many distant objects could be used to look for small signals. Another context in which a gravitational lensing signal can be searched for is cases of strong lensing. The lensing flux anomaly refers to the phenomenon that strongly magnified images of a distant source have flux ratios that are discordant with expectations from a smooth lensing halo (Mao & Schneider 1998, Metcalf & Madau 2001, Chiba 2002, Dalal & Kochanek 2002, Hezaveh et al. 2016a, Alexander et al. 2020, Dai et al. 2020). For instance, two images close to a critical line (corresponding to a fold caustic) are expected to have the same magnification, barring substructures on scales smaller than the image separation. Interference substructures can cause a ∼10% difference in cases of high magnification of ∼100 (Chan et al. 2020, Hui et al. 2021). Because subhalos also give rise to such a flux anomaly, to distinguish between FDM and conventional CDM, a measurement of the anomaly as a function of image separation would be helpful. The anomaly power spectrum of FDM would have a feature around the de Broglie scale.',\n",

Novel observables for the detection of the axion as a field (or wave) rather than as a particle were discussed by Graham & Rajendran (2013). Stochastic properties of the axion field were computed by Derevianko (2018) and Foster et al. (2018).

       "  'text': 'In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the sSFR (sSFR≡SFR/M∗) of galaxies with different masses at different times in the history of the Universe. The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M∗, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M∗ correlation. For the “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a “downsizing” picture first introduced by Cowie et al. (1996). Dwarf galaxies continue to undergo major episodes of activity. The tightness of this SFR-M∗ correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH. Starburst galaxies, whose SFRs are significantly elevated above the main-sequence correlation, contribute only a small fraction of the global SFRD at z⩽2 (Rodighiero et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2012). Instead, the evolution of the cosmic SFR is primarily due to the steadily evolving properties of main-sequence disk galaxies.',\n",

       "  'text': \"The Galactic Corona began with Spitzer's insight that cold clouds could be confined by a hot surrounding medium. This model has matured over the years into a strong line of theoretical research focused on the detailed physics of how the thermal, hydrodynamic, and ionization states of CGM gas evolve in dark matter halos. Placing multiphase gas into the context of the dark matter halo, Maller & Bullock (2004) suggested cold clouds cooled out of thermal instabilities in a hot medium while maintaining rough pressure equilibrium [though see Binney et al. (2009) for a counterpoint]. Accretion may also be seeded by gas ejected from the disk, as in the galactic fountain or precipitation model (e.g., Fraternali & Binney 2008, Voit et al. 2015b). These scenarios start with very simple assumptions—such as hydrostatic hot halos, diffuse clouds in PIE, or particular radial entropy profiles. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because we do not know the large-scale physical state of the CGM as a whole. Photoionization modeling of the low-ionization CGM using only the EUVB (Haardt & Madau 2001) strongly disfavors hydrostatic equilibrium with hot gas at T\\nvir (Werk et al. 2014); the cool and hot phases appear to have similar densities, rather than similar pressures. Furthermore, if Ovi-traced gas follows a hydrostatic profile at the temperature where its ionization fraction peaks, T ∼105.5 K, then its column density profile would be significantly steeper than observed (Tumlinson et al. 2011). There may be other means of supporting this gas, such as turbulence (Fielding et al. 2017), cosmic rays (Salem et al. 2016), or magnetic fields.\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Is the disk maximal? As shown with the illustrative models in \\nFigure 16\\n, the answer to this question largely depends on the disk (mass) scale length. These models include a bulge with dynamical mass fitted to the BRAVA kinematic data and stellar mass corresponding to a Kroupa IMF with ±10% margins (Portail et al. 2015b). The disk has local stellar surface density of \\n\\n (Bovy & Rix 2013) and scale lengths R\\nd=2.15kpc (Bissantz & Gerhard 2002, Bovy & Rix 2013), 2.6kpc (Robin et al. 2003, Jurić et al. 2008), and 3.0kpc (Kent et al. 1991, Gould et al. 1996) and includes a gas disk with surface density of \\n\\n and twice the stellar scale length. A short scale length R\\nd has important implications: The Galaxy's disk (summed over all stellar and gaseous components) is then maximal (Sackett 1997) in the sense that the disk and bulge dominate the rotation curve, i.e., contribute 85% of the rotational velocity and ∼70% of the rotational support at 2.2R\\nd. We included the bulge in the definition here because it mostly originates from the disk (Section 4.2). For the three scale lengths shown, the baryonic component provides a median fraction fv\\n= (86%, 73%, 65%) of the circular velocity and (74%, 53%, 42%) of the radial force at 2.2R\\nd.

       "  'text': 'Many of the most advanced hydrodynamic simulations today have shown that it is possible for baryonic feedback to erase the central cusps shown in the density profiles in \\nFigure 4\\n and produce core-like density profiles as inferred from rotation curves such as those shown in \\nFigure 9\\n (Mashchenko et al. 2008, Pontzen & Governato 2012, Madau et al. 2014, Oñorbe et al. 2015, Read et al. 2016). One key prediction is that the effect of core creation will vary with the mass in stars formed (Governato et al. 2012, Di Cintio et al. 2014). If galaxies form enough stars, there will be enough energy from supernovae to redistribute DM and create significant cores. If too many baryons end up in stars, however, the excess central mass can compensate and drag DM back in. At the other extreme, if too few stars are formed, there will not be enough energy in supernovae to alter halo density structure, and the resultant DM distribution will resemble DM-only simulations. Although the possible importance of supernova-driven blowouts for the central DM structure of dwarf galaxies was already appreciated by Navarro et al. (1996) and Gnedin & Zhao (2002), an important recent development is the understanding that even low-level star formation over an extended period can drive gravitational potential fluctuations that lead to DM core formation.',\n",

The kinematics can be measured from either stars or gas in the vicinity of the black hole. For stellar-dynamical modeling, state-of-the-art codes use Schwarzschild modeling (Schwarzschild 1979) to jointly model the mass density of the central black hole, stars, and dark matter by orbit superposition (e.g., Rix et al. 1997, Gebhardt et al. 2003). The stellar-mass profile is modeled from the light, which is then converted to a mass profile by solving for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and if needed a dark matter halo component is also independently fitted (e.g., Gebhardt & Thomas 2009). The orbit families are weighted to match the spatially resolved stellar kinematical measurements. A major issue for all dynamical models is distinguishing between orbital anisotropy and mass (e.g., a black hole). This mass–anisotropy degeneracy is well known (e.g., Binney & Mamon 1982). Other (related) issues include: (a) degeneracy between the stellar M/L and the black hole mass, (b) incomplete stellar orbit libraries, and (c) the assumption of axisymmetry (van den Bosch & de Zeeuw 2010). The systematic uncertainties for black hole masses from gas dynamics are qualitatively different than they are for stellar dynamics, but given the large systematics for both kinds of analysis, we use them interchangeably in our discussion (although see a more complete discussion in Walsh et al. 2013).',\n",

It appears, therefore, that γ-ray emission from AGNs occurs at a variety of sites, some close to the SMBH and some close to the radio-emitting regions. Nalewajko et al. (2014) have presented an observational plan to locate the sites of synchrotron and Compton emission and argued that spine-sheath jet structure models are not a plausible alternative to external broad emission line photons.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Early papers (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Blandford & Begelman 1999) conjectured that hot accretion flows should have strong winds and, by extension, jets. Observational evidence for such an association has accumulated in recent years, with the recognition that essentially all LLAGNs are radio loud (Falcke et al. 2000, Nagar et al. 2000, Ho 2002) and the parallel discovery that virtually every BHB in a hard state has radio emission (Corbel et al. 2000; Fender 2001, 2006; Fender et al. 2004). Because all these systems may have hot accretion flows (Section 4.2), a direct causal connection between hot flows and radio-emitting jets seems likely. In contrast, jets are much weaker and are often not seen in systems that have cool geometrically thin disks. Although there is no definitive explanation for this dichotomy, three effects likely play a role: (a) Compared with thin disks, geometrically thick disks more easily advect the magnetic field to the black hole (Livio et al. 1999, Guilet & Ogilvie 2012); (b) the Bernoulli parameter of the gas in hot accretion flows is larger, hence enhancing winds in these systems (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Blandford & Begelman 1999); and (c) strong winds help to collimate and stabilize the jet (Appl & Camenzind 1992, 1993; Beskin & Malyshkin 2000).',\n",

All four are transient magnetars, and their radio emission is transient too and associated with an X-ray outburst. In XTE J1810−197 (the first detected radio-emitting magnetar), pulsations were observed after, but not before, its 2003 outburst. The radio pulsations disappeared in late 2008 with no prior secular decrease in radio flux (Camilo et al. 2016). Behavior in the other sources is similar (Camilo et al. 2007a, Levin et al. 2012). The persistent (i.e., nontransient) magnetars and several other transient magnetars have been searched for radio pulsations but with no detections (e.g., Lazarus et al. 2012, Tong et al. 2013b). In the four magnetars with confirmed radio pulsations, the radio emission in all cases is very bright and shows large pulse-to-pulse variability, with pulse morphologies, both single and average, that can be broad and that generally change enormously on timescales of minutes. They can be punctuated by spiky peaks that can be much shorter than the pulse period. This radio emission is also highly linearly polarized, with polarization fractions of 60–100%. No evidence for a radio burst at the epoch of a GF has been seen (Tendulkar et al. 2016).',\n",

In terms of applicability to the SDSS, note that the SDSS spectra can only reliably measure stellar velocity dispersions above σ∼70 km s−1, corresponding to BH masses larger than of order 106M⊙ (depending on which version of M-σ is adopted). A complementary probe of lower-mass SMBHs in the SDSS is provided by using mass estimates based on the broad emission-line width for Type 1 AGNs (Greene & Ho 2007b, Dong et al. 2012, Kormendy & Ho 2013).',\n",

Several aspects of the UFDs make them critical objects to understand, with potentially wide-ranging implications. First, UFDs reside in the smallest dark matter halos yet found. Although only the mass at the very center of the halo is currently measurable, the extrapolated virial masses of UFDs are ∼109 M\\n\\n (e.g., Strigari et al. 2008), and the halo masses at the time when the stars formed may have been ∼108 M\\n\\n (e.g., Bovill & Ricotti 2009, Safarzadeh et al. 2018). UFDs are also the most dark matter–dominated systems known. This combination of small halo mass and negligible baryonic mass makes UFDs extremely valuable laboratories for constraining the nature of dark matter. Simply counting the number of such objects around the Milky Way places a limit on the mass of the dark matter particle (e.g., Jethwa et al. 2018). The census and observed mass function of low-mass halos point the direction toward solving the long-standing and highly contentious missing satellite problem (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999, Moore et al. 1999, Simon & Geha 2007, Brooks et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2018). The measured central densities, and perhaps eventually the density profiles, of UFDs provide significant clues to the behavior of dark matter on small scales (e.g., Calabrese & Spergel 2016, Bozek et al. 2019, Errani et al. 2018).',\n",

Assuming an average inclination angle of 40 deg and R = 2.5kpc, they found that the z ∼ 6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor of 15 more massive than expected from the local BH–bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high-redshift quasars either got a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M–σ relation existed at z ∼ 6, then it would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused on the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang et al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle and/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful dynamic modeling of their \\n\\n observations (including inclination and size). They found a mean dynamical mass of ∼5 × 1010 M⊙ for a sample of luminous z ∼ 6 quasars with ∼109 M⊙ BHs. As shown in \\nFigure 10\\n, this places them about one order of magnitude above the local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly affected by potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Volonteri & Stark 2011, Huang et al. 2018). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower \\n\\n line width (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation.\\n',\n",

This leads to more precise measurements of known PK parameters and the detection of new ones, greatly increasing the sample of NS mass measurements and the number of GR tests in different systems. Furthermore, improved receiver sensitivities and larger bandwidth, together with multibeaming, increase the general sensitivity to all sorts of pulsars, as in the case of the phenomenally successful Parkes multibeam (PMB) surveys (Manchester et al. 2001). Since then, the newer generation of post-PMB surveys like the new HTRU-South (Keith et al. 2010) and North surveys (Barr et al. 2013), the Green Bank drift scan survey (Boyles et al. 2013, Lynch et al. 2013), the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey (Stovall et al. 2014), the Arecibo ALFA survey (Cordes et al. 2006, Lazarus 2013), and the Arecibo 327-MHz drift-scan survey (Deneva et al. 2013) has been making full use of much improved data-handling capabilities and processing power to obtain a large increase in spectral and time resolution (at a cost of 100 times the data rate).

       "  'text': \"Theoretical predictions of LISA event rates for merging massive BHs have been derived from numerous semianalytical models as well as more recently from cosmological galaxy evolution simulations. The predictions span a wide range, from no detectable events in the most pessimistic case up to several tens of events per year per unit redshift at z = 10, and a few events per year even at \\n\\n in the most optimistic models (for recent predictions see, e.g., Klein et al. 2016, Hartwig et al. 2018a, Ricarte & Natarajan 2018; for earlier studies that included the \\n\\n Universe see, e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Tanaka & Haiman 2009 and references therein). The most pessimistic scenario is for stellar-mass BHs to stay below LISA's detection threshold and for massive seed BHs to form inefficiently or to be unable to promptly merge when their hosts merge. The largest rates arise when abundant stellar-mass BH seeds are assumed to grow above LISA's \\n\\n103–4 M⊙ detection threshold by z ∼ 10 or in models in which massive seeds are assumed to form efficiently in a large fraction of ACHs. Aside from the total event rates, the mass spectrum is expected to depend on the seeding and should help disentangle models. LISA data can indeed distinguish between a wide variety of models that include different prescriptions for seed formation, feedback, accretion efficiency, and accretion geometry (Sesana et al. 2011). LISA may also be able to probe SMS star formation itself by measuring mergers of the remnants of binary SMSs (Hartwig et al. 2018a) or directly detecting their formation process, via either the burst accompanying the collapse of a rotating SMS into a single massive BH (Saijo & Hawke 2009, Shibata et al. 2016) or the breakup of such an SMS producing two massive BHs, which subsequently inspiral and merge (Reisswig et al. 2013).\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Redshifted Lyα remains a mainstay for high-redshift spectroscopic confirmations. A small population of galaxies with redshifts 7.5 ≳ z ≳ 8 have been confirmed, often selected from HST CANDELS imaging. These include an early discovery of Lyα emission at z = 7.51 (Finkelstein et al. 2013), which also has a grism continuum measurement of the Lyman break (Tilvi et al. 2016). Over the next few years, this object was followed by a range of Lyα emitters spectroscopically confirmed at z = 7.45–8 (Oesch et al. 2015, Roberts-Borsani et al. 2016, Song et al. 2016b, Hoag et al. 2017, Stark et al. 2017, Larson et al. 2018, Jung et al. 2019), including a gamma-ray burst host galaxy at z = 7.8 (Tanvir et al. 2018) and a primitive galaxy group at z = 7.7 (Tilvi et al. 2020). Recently, a large-scale campaign with Keck/MOSFIRE using 10 nights targeted six dozen systems, achieving 10 detections at redshifts z = 7.1–8.2 (Jung et al. 2020; see also Pentericci et al. 2018). The demonstrated ability to spectroscopically confirm high-redshift galaxies using near-UV emission lines redward of Lyα was a hallmark achievement for the study of early galaxies. As discussed in Section 2.7, the presence of neutral hydrogen in the IGM during the cosmic reionization process can substantially attenuate Lyα. Having other available lines for spectroscopic redshift confirmation may therefore be critical during the reionization process and at earlier times. Stark et al. (2015a) detected Ciii] 1909 Å in galaxies at z ∼ 6.029 and z = 7.213 with known Lyα redshifts. Stark et al. (2015b) detected Civ 1243 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα redshift of z = 7.045. Laporte et al. (2017) detected Lyα and Ciii] in a z ∼ 6.8 galaxy. At slightly lower redshift, an interesting discovery for understanding the internal ionizing spectrum of star-forming galaxies was the confirmation of Civ 1550 Å and Oiii] λ = 1666 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα z = 6.11 (Mainali et al. 2017). The presence of Ciii] has now been confirmed in galaxies at z = 7.51 (Hutchison et al. 2019; same object as Finkelstein et al. 2013), z = 7.73 (Stark et al. 2017; same object as Oesch et al. 2015), and recently z = 7.945 (Topping et al. 2021).',\n",

       "  'text': 'How can gas fragment to small scales? There are at least two possible mechanisms: (a) If the cooling time t\\ncool falls far below the sound-crossing time t\\nsc ∼ R/c\\n\\ns\\n in a cooling cloud, causing it to become strongly underpressured relative to surrounding hot gas, P\\ncloud ≪ P\\nhot, the cloud-crushing shock can shatter the cloud (McCourt et al. 2018). These authors argued that similar to the Jeans instability, where gravitational fragmentation leads to a characteristic scale λJ ∼ c\\ns\\nt\\nff, fragmentation in cooling, pressure-confined clouds imprints a scale ℓcloudlet∼c\\ns\\nt\\ncool ∼ 0.1pc(n/cm−3)−1, where the quantity c\\ns\\nt\\ncool is evaluated at its minimum at T ∼ 104 K. Although this length scale depends on the ambient pressure confining the clouds, the column density through an individual fragment N\\ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 is essentially independent of environment. Cooling of large (R ≫ c\\ns\\nt\\ncool) clouds that subsequently shatter is easily triggered by large nonlinear perturbations (e.g., via turbulence). Shocks are particularly effective at shattering cold gas, via either compression of preexisting cold gas (Mellema et al. 2002) or fragmentation in the radiative shock (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Shattering can also arise during initially isobaric linear thermal instability,\\n24\\n once the cloud loses sonic contact with its surroundings as it cools (Gronke & Oh 2020b, Das et al. 2021). (b) Another avenue for producing small cloudlets is via mixing in KH instabilities; the tails of clouds in winds show a plethora of dense small clumps (Cooper et al. 2009, McCourt et al. 2018, Sparre et al. 2019), which have a column density distribution that peaks at Ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 (Liang & Remming 2020), corresponding to the characteristic scale l ∼ c\\n\\ns\\n\\nt\\ncool suggested for cooling driven fragmentation. \\nFigure 11\\n shows fragmentation by these two respective processes. Shattering due to thermal instability in halo merger shocks can produce very low-metallicity LLSs, far from any galaxy (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Numerical resolution obviously affects the onset and efficiency of shattering, but it can even affect the multiphase nature of gas. Mandelker et al. (2021) find that if c\\ns\\nt\\ncool at T ∼ 105 K is unresolved, gas piles up at T ∼ 105 K as further cooling becomes inefficient.\\n',\n",

The conclusion that most Pop III SNe were CCSNe is consistent with the work of Mapelli et al. (2006), who compute the expected density of intermediate-mass black holes in the Galaxy by assuming they are the relics of higher-mass Pop III stars. This allows them to derive an upper limit from the nondetection of ultraluminous X-ray sources in the Milky Way. The approach has been extended by de Bennassuti et al. (2014, 2017), who also include the Galactic metallicity function and the abundances of EMP stars. Again these data appear inconsistent with PISNe being important (although see Salvadori et al. 2019 for a contrary view). Taken together, these studies suggest that most Pop III stars forming through the standard pathway outlined in Section 3.2 are not likely to reach masses significantly above ∼40M⊙, with more massive objects being extremely rare and possibly being the result of collisions in very dense clusters (see Section 5.3).',\n",

The L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method results in the largest number of measured fC\\n. The second category includes methods that apply to the mean covering factor of the population. This is obtained by classifying a source as either a type-I or a type-II AGN and using the resulting N\\ntype-II,L\\n/N\\ntype-I,L\\n ratio as an estimate of the mean value of fC\\n. One such method measures the X-ray-absorbing column and determines the AGN type relative to a fiducial absorbing column that separates the groups (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003, Gilli et al. 2007, Hasinger 2008, Brightman & Ueda 2012, Malizia et al. 2012). Another method counts the number of broad- and narrow-emission-line AGNs in optical and IR-selected samples. Ideally, all methods should agree but this is not the case (e.g., Lawrence & Elvis 2010; Lusso et al. 2013, 2014; Mayo & Lawrence 2013). Mixed results are due to poorly understood physics of the torus, various selection effects, uncertainties in estimating L\\nAGN, and intrinsic reddening, among others. For example, the L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method is based on dust emission from the torus and has little to do with BLR properties. However, X-ray absorption by gas in the BLR can increase the total measured X-ray column, thus decreasing L\\ndust because the ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust-free gas never interacts with the dusty torus.

The similarity in size-scale with the radial extent of the IMF variations in massive ETGs (\\n\\n2 kpc, e.g., van Dokkum et al. 2017, La Barbera et al. 2019) tempts speculation that the IMF signal is linked specifically to the surviving stars from the in situ formation phase, which are thought still to dominate the innermost regions (<0.1 R\\neff) of their descendent galaxies at z = 0 (e.g., Rodriguez-Gomez et al. 2016). This picture finds support in some rare relic galaxies at low redshift that are thought to have suffered little accretion after the initial phase, and which indeed seem to exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs at all radii (Ferré-Mateu et al. 2017).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Most, if not all, stars form in star clusters and are expected to be temporally and spatially correlated, eventually driving superbubbles with more efficient energy coupling and momentum generation (e.g., Mac Low & McCray 1988, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Sharma et al. 2014). The typical velocity dispersion in newly born star clusters is ∼1 km s−1 or 1 pc Myr−1. Assuming the cluster becomes unbound, massive stars can travel up to 40 pc before they explode (assuming typical supernova delay times for single stellar populations). These walkaway stars can therefore easily leave their dense birthplaces and explode in lower-density regions. As most of the volume of the ISM is not in the cold phase, most supernovae might explode in the warm or hot phase, significantly changing the coupling efficiency (Slyz et al. 2005, Ceverino & Klypin 2009). There is also the runaway star population (Gies & Bolton 1986) (about 45% of O stars and 15% of B stars are runaways) with typical velocities of ∼30–40 km s−1 and maximum velocities as high as a few hundred kilometers per second (e.g., Silva & Napiwotzki 2011). These high-velocity stars originate from close binary systems becoming unbound by a supernova explosion (Zwicky 1957, Blaauw 1961) and/or from dynamical interactions in dense regions of star clusters (Poveda et al. 1967). They can travel up to several hundreds of parsecs away from their birthplaces far into interarm regions or the lower galactic halo. Their explosion locations in galactic disks can therefore be considered as almost random, similar to the explosions of type Ia supernovae, which contribute about 20–25% to the supernova rate in the Solar Neighborhood (Tammann et al. 1994). They explode independently of the gas mass distribution within the ISM, a process approximately taken into account in high-resolution simulations of stratified disks that are most useful to study the launching of outflows and, at the same time, create a realistically structured ISM (e.g., de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Hill et al. 2012, Li et al. 2017). Such detailed small-scale simulations with a realistic ISM structure will help to bridge the gap in scale and physical understanding to galaxy-scale simulations.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The level of realism achieved by state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy population has advanced dramatically in the past decade. Despite this success, the outcomes are particularly sensitive to subgrid implementations of feedback processes. It is thus reasonable to argue that this success suffices only to establish that the basic sketch of galaxy-formation theory within the ΛCDM cosmogony is plausible. The development of simulations that can be used to stress test a truly comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution will require confrontation of the devil in the details. Simulations of the galaxy population do not accurately reproduce the internal and vertical structure of galaxies and their reliance on subgrid methods to approximate the influence of unresolved physics leaves lingering degeneracies that diminish predictive power. Furthermore, the simulations neglect physical processes known to be significant in certain regimes. From our suite of examples, only IllustrisTNG models magnetic fields, which could impact cosmic gas flows and thus affect the evolution of galaxies (Pillepich et al. 2018a, van de Voort et al. 2021). The omission of magnetic fields also precludes realistic modeling of the influence of cosmic rays, which, owing to their ISM energy density being comparable with those of the thermal and magnetic pressures, likely influence galaxy-wide outflows (Uhlig et al. 2012). Similarly, thermal conduction influences the structure of the ICM and cooling onto massive galaxies (Carilli & Taylor 2002) but is generally neglected. Modeling the UVB as a spatially uniform radiation field that “switches on” at a fixed redshift is a particularly crude approximation for the evolution of galaxies during the EoR, when local sources of ionizing radiation can dominate the regulation of galaxy growth (Wise & Cen 2009, Trebitsch et al. 2017, Katz et al. 2020). Locally varying radiation fields, such as those produced by flickering AGNs, can also overionize gas and lead to cooling rates being overestimated by orders of magnitude if equilibrium conditions are assumed (Vasiliev 2011, Richings et al. 2014).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Age-dating stars is a fraught problem (Soderblom et al. 2014), so the conclusions we draw must be regarded as somewhat tentative, though the situation has improved considerably in the past few years. By far the most comprehensively studied region is the Orion complex. The young stars in Orion are spread over several tens of parsecs, but molecular gas and ongoing star formation are limited to a smaller ∼10 pc region around the ONC, which is ≈1 pc in size (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998 find \\n\\n pc) and is centered on \\n\\n Ori C, the most massive star in the complex. The ONC is the densest region, and, despite its small volume, represents a significant fraction of the total number of stars in the complex. We illustrate one recent measurement of the age distribution in Orion in \\nFigure 13\\n, which suggests three important conclusions that apply to other star-forming regions as well (e.g., Tan et al. 2006, Azimlu et al. 2015, Caldwell & Chang 2018, Getman et al. 2018). First, the densest regions show age spreads that are substantially larger than their dynamical times. Using the ages shown in \\nFigure 13\\n, the time over which 90% of the ONC stars formed is ≈6 Myr (other studies give similar results: Reggiani et al. 2011, Da Rio et al. 2016, Beccari et al. 2017), whereas the free-fall time is ≈0.6 Myr (Tan et al. 2006, Da Rio et al. 2014). Consequently, star formation has been ongoing for ≈10 free-fall times. Although the absolute ages and the magnitude of the age spread depend on the choice of age indicator, the conclusion that there is a substantial age spread is robust against this choice and against possible contamination due to photometric variability (Messina et al. 2017) or variable accretion histories (see the sidebar titled False Age Spreads for Accreting Young Stellar Objects?). This conclusion is also bolstered by kinematic observations showing that the ONC is very close to virial equilibrium (Kim et al. 2019), implying that it must have had time to relax dynamically.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\n2.3.1.2. Secular interactions.\\nSecular interactions are slow exchanges of angular momentum between widely separated planets. Secular interactions take place over thousands or even millions of years, depending on the separation and mass of the planets involved. Through secular interactions, a Jupiter can deposit its angular momentum into other planets or stars in the system on a timescale of many orbits. Planets can swap angular momentum periodically (e.g., Petrovich 2015b) or chaotically (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011, Hamers et al. 2017), driving the Jupiter's eccentricity to large values. The latter scenario requires three or more planets and is known as secular chaos. (Chaos can occur in hierarchical two-planet systems as well, but it requires large eccentricities and inclinations; see Wu & Lithwick 2011 for a discussion.) Kozai–Lidov cycles are a type of periodic angular momentum exchange that also trade off mutual inclination and eccentricity (Kozai 1962, Lidov 1962, Naoz 2016). Kozai–Lidov cycles can also occur in an initially coplanar system when the outer body is on a highly elliptical orbit (Li et al. 2014b). Kozai–Lidov cycles driven by a star (e.g., Wu & Murray 2003, Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007, Katz et al. 2011, Naoz et al. 2012, Petrovich 2015a) or planet (e.g., Naoz et al. 2011; see Teyssandier et al. 2013 for distinctions between planet–planet and planet–star Kozai) have been widely hypothesized to trigger high-eccentricity tidal migration of hot Jupiters. In another scenario, multiple secular frequencies within a system coincide, creating a secular resonance that elevates planets' eccentricities (e.g., Minton & Malhotra 2011, Xu & Lai 2016). Examples of several types of secular excitation interactions are shown in \\nFigure 3\\n.\",\n",

The extremely short timescale of only a few years probably hints at severe instability in the final nuclear burning sequences, especially Ne and O burning (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Quataert & Shiode 2012, Shiode & Quataert 2014, Smith & Arnett 2014), each of which lasts about 1 year. These instabilities may be exacerbated in the most massive stars, although much theoretical work remains to be done. The increased instability at very high initial masses is extreme in cases in which pre-SN eruptions result from the PPI (Woosley et al. 2002, 2007), but eruptions may extend to other nuclear burning instabilities as well (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Smith & Arnett 2014). Although the events listed above are just a few lucky cases, they may also be the tip of the iceberg. Undoubtedly, continued work on the flood of new transient discoveries will reveal more of these cases. [Indeed, as this review went to press, Fraser et al. (2013b) reported the recovery in archival data of an outburst one year before the SN IIn-P 2011ht.] The limitation will be the existence of high-quality archival data over long timescales of years before the SNe, but these sorts of archives are becoming more populated and improved as time passes. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope arrives, it may become routine to detect pre-SN outbursts, although constraining their physical nature with spectra will still be a challenge.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'An axiomatic feature of most torus models is that the obscuring gas and dust are broadly symmetric along the rotation axis of the accretion flow. This is motivated by the presence of ionization cones observed in NLR gas (e.g., Zakamska et al. 2006, Fischer et al. 2013) and hidden BLRs in some Seyfert 2 galaxies (see Section 2.1.2). However, recent high-resolution observations of a handful of nearby AGN tori using mid-IR interferometry have revealed the presence of substantial dust emission along the polar direction on parsec scales (e.g., Hönig et al. 2012, Tristram et al. 2014, López-Gonzaga et al. 2016). These polar structures can extend to larger scales, as shown by imaging observations (e.g., Asmus et al. 2016). The physical origin of these features is still unclear but may be associated with an AGN-driven outflow (e.g., Schartmann et al. 2014). In addition, recent observations have cast some doubt on the notion of a compact torus being the sole origin of reflected X-ray emission, as is often assumed in the modeling of obscured AGN (e.g., Murphy & Yaqoob 2009, Brightman & Nandra 2011). Spatially resolved Chandra observations have found evidence for Fe Kα lines produced up to ≈1 kpc away from the nucleus (e.g., Bauer et al. 2015, Fabbiano et al. 2017). Taken together, these results suggest that emission features that have previously been attributed to a compact, axisymmetric torus may often originate from gas and dust with very different geometries. Obscuring material on larger scales may be associated with nuclear starbursts, which are discussed in Section 4.2.',\n",

Cases where lines are likely in non-LTE include millimeter observations of the disk atmosphere and rovibrational lines. A common approach in these cases is to use an LVG (Large Velocity Gradient) approximation (Piétu et al. 2007, van der Tak et al. 2007) or Monte Carlo–based radiative transfer codes (Brinch & Hogerheijde 2010, Hogerheijde & van der Tak 2000) coupled with an observation simulator to extract molecular abundances.

For IR lines, fast line ray tracers can also be coupled to thermochemical codes to predict the rich line emission from disk regions with large velocity gradients (Pontoppidan et al. 2009, Bosman et al. 2017, Woitke et al. 2018).

This became possible also thanks to the availability of large multiwavelength surveys such as SDSS (York et al. 2000), 2MASS (Skrutskie et al. 2006), and Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX; Martin et al. 2005) surveys, which measured stellar masses, star-formation rates (SFRs), and a plethora of other properties that could be used to define representative samples for Hi and CO follow-up. The largest single cold gas surveys in the nearby Universe are xGASS (Catinella et al. 2010, 2012, 2013, 2018) and xCOLD GASS (Saintonge et al. 2011a,b, 2017), which obtained Hi and CO observations for 1,179 and 532 galaxies, respectively, at 0.01 < z < 0.05. The objects were selected from SDSS and are representative of the full galaxy population with M\\n\\\\* > 109 M⊙. The strength of these surveys comes from their sample size, the homogeneity of all the data products, and the depth of the observations. As is shown in Section 4, the latter is of particular importance as it makes it possible to infer the cold gas properties of even the most gas-poor subpopulations, via either spectral stacking or the setting of stringent upper limits. Other notable global cold gas surveys include RESOLVE (Stark et al. 2016), designed to be baryonic mass limited; HRS (Boselli et al. 2010), which includes 322 galaxies (225 of which have CO observations and 315 have Hi data from the literature) that span the full range of environments, from low-density regions to the core of the Virgo cluster; and ALLSMOG (Bothwell et al. 2014, Cicone et al. 2017), which observed CO(2–1) in 88 galaxies in the mass range of 108.5 < M\\n\\\\*/M⊙ < 1010, increasing the coverage of parameter space toward lower-mass galaxies.

       "  'text': 'The regions of lower dark matter density are unable to efficiently acquire gas and therefore grow more slowly and gradually. They form disk galaxies, which at high redshift are observed to have high gas fractions (Daddi et al. 2010, Tacconi et al. 2010), have large velocity dispersions, be turbulent compared with their local counterparts (Förster Schreiber et al. 2006, 2009; Genzel et al. 2006, 2008; Law et al. 2012; Kassin et al. 2012; Stott et al. 2016), and appear unstable to clump formation (Elmegreen et al. 2007, Genzel et al. 2011). These clumps may sink toward the center and start forming the bulge (Bournaud et al. 2007, Dekel et al. 2009), or the gas may simply spiral toward the nucleus to grow the bulge in starbursts. During the initial stages, when the velocity dispersion of their groups is quite small, gas-rich mergers can also happen. Isolated spirals are able to sustain nearly constant star formation for a long time, possibly with the contribution of the so called cosmological fountain effect (Fraternali & Binney 2008, Fraternali 2014). During this phase they lie on the so-called star-formation main sequence (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Salim et al. 2007).',\n",

From this, we infer the required rate of transformation to reproduce the rise in total condensed matter. This is the result of the net conversion of ionized gas from the CGM and IGM reservoirs into cold gas and stars (e.g., Wolfe et al. 2005, Prochaska & Wolfe 2009, Bauermeister et al. 2010, Zafar et al. 2013). This is inclusive of recycling material on galactic scales, with some material previously ejected and ionized by feedback returning to the condensed phases. We plot this net rate of conversion of ionized gas into the condensed phase per unit volume in \\nFigure 6b\\n\\n. The net accretion rate density continuously declines with cosmic time. Also plotted is the baryonic accretion rate onto halos as a function of redshift. We calculate the total mass accretion as the virial mass growth rate of halos from Dekel et al.

The baryon mass accretion rate is the total matter accretion rate scaled by the cosmic baryon fraction (\\n\\n in our adopted cosmology). The baryon and net condensed matter accretion rates have similar shapes; both are high until \\n\\n and then drop significantly through today. The drop in accretion rate at low redshift is caused in part by the expansion of the Universe as galaxies are driven away from each other by the repulsive force of dark energy; accretion and merging are slowed, and galaxies are gradually starved of incoming fuel. This accretion rate includes the effects of both smooth accretion and mergers, whose mix changes with redshift and halo mass (Padmanabhan & Loeb 1999).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Atmospheric retrieval refers to deriving the atmospheric properties of a planet from its observed spectrum. The canonical retrieval method comprises a parametric forward model of an exoplanetary atmosphere coupled with a parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the model parameters given a spectral data set. The free parameters in the model include the dominant chemical species with strong features in the observed spectral bandpass, the temperature profile, and the macroscopic cloud/haze parameters, e.g., the location in the atmosphere, spatial extent, and opacity, besides any other free parameters relevant to the spectrum at hand. The first retrieval codes came out a decade ago (Madhusudhan & Seager 2009, 2010); a number of codes are currently available in the field with applicability over the wide range of observations possible. A recent review of existing retrieval codes and capabilities in the field is available from Madhusudhan (2018). The latest developments in retrievals include incorporation of nonequilibrium phenomena at varying levels of complexity, such as different prescriptions for clouds/hazes (e.g., Line et al. 2016, Barstow et al. 2017, Lavie et al. 2017b, MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017b), deviations from radiative–convective equilibrium (Gandhi & Madhusudhan 2017), and benchmarking with 3D circulation models (Blecic et al. 2017). State-of-the-art codes use a wide range of parameter estimation methods spanning Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Blecic et al. 2017), optimal estimation gradient-descent algorithm (Barstow et al. 2017), and nested sampling algorithm (e.g., Benneke & Seager 2013). More recently, machine learning algorithms have been explored for atmospheric retrieval (e.g., Waldmann 2016). In recent years, state-of-the-art retrieval codes have allowed detailed constraints on the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, and properties of clouds/hazes in a number of exoplanets, both transiting and directly imaged (Madhusudhan 2018).',\n",

       "  'text': 'The broad H\\n\\n emission is well suited to estimate mass outflow rates and energetics. Assuming case B recombination and an electron temperature \\n\\n, the mass of ionized gas in the outflow can be estimated via \\n\\n, where \\n\\n is the intrinsic luminosity in the broad emission component and \\n\\n is the local electron density, from which the mass outflow rate can be computed as \\n\\n, where \\n\\n and \\n\\n are the outflow velocity and extent, respectively (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011, Newman et al. 2012a). Calculations typically assume H dominates the mass, and a 36% mass correction for He is applied. Based on these relationships, \\n\\n estimates in the range of ∼0.1 up to above unity were derived on galactic and subgalactic scales (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2012a,b; Davies et al. 2019; Förster Schreiber et al. 2019; Freeman et al. 2019; Swinbank et al. 2019). Although details in assumptions and samples vary among studies, a key difference lies in the adopted value for \\n\\n, which ranges between ∼50 and ∼400 cm−3. No significant or mildly positive trends of \\n\\n with stellar mass were found in the larger samples spanning \\n\\n, assuming a constant \\n\\n (e.g., Freeman et al. 2019, Förster Schreiber et al. 2019, Swinbank et al. 2019). Estimates based on IS absorption features depend more importantly on geometrical factors, as the absorption strength traces the gas columns along the line of sight, with \\n\\n (where \\n\\n and \\n\\n are the angular and clumpiness covering fractions, respectively, and \\n\\n is the column density), as well as ISM chemistry and radiative transfer effects on the line profiles (e.g., Veilleux et al. 2005). Under reasonable assumptions, \\n\\n was found in outflow studies of SFG samples employing this technique (e.g., Weiner et al. 2009, Kornei et al. 2012). Comparing wind momentum and energy rate, \\n\\n and \\n\\n, to the momentum and luminosity input from star formation, \\n\\n and \\n\\n, most results are in the ranges \\n\\n–1 and \\n\\n and thus are consistent with momentum-driven winds powered by the star-formation activity (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011, Newman et al. 2012a, Förster Schreiber et al. 2019; but see Swinbank et al. 2019 for a contrasting result). Trends of \\n\\n found in other studies from emission and IS absorption diagnostics suggest a possible mixture of momentum and energy driving (e.g., Weiner et al. 2009, Davies et al. 2019).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Using gamma-ray observations, Grenier et al. (2005) found gas that was not seen in either Hi or CO emission. It is now considered to be mainly molecular (Murray et al. 2018a) and is known as the CO-poor or CO-dark molecular gas that was observed earlier in translucent clouds and explained by theoretical models (van Dishoeck & Black 1987, Lada & Blitz 1988, van Dishoeck 1990). The CO-dark layer is located at an A\\nV ∼ 1 in PDRs, where H2 self-shielding creates a layer of H2, whereas CO forms deeper into the cloud (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). Wolfire et al. (2010) constructed theoretical models of the surfaces of illuminated molecular clouds and found, for local Galactic conditions, a CO-dark mass fraction of ∼30%. Values of ∼30–50% are roughly consistent with Galactic observations from gamma-ray observations (Grenier et al. 2005), dust emission from the Planck Surveyor Satellite (Planck Collab. et al. 2011), extinction from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (Paradis et al. 2012), [Cii] line emission from Herschel (Pineda et al. 2013), and mass estimates from numerical simulations of galactic disks where the CO-dark gas is found in interarm filaments (e.g., Smith et al. 2014; see also Kalberla et al. 2020). There is also a significant CO-dark fraction in the diffuse gas discussed in Section 7.3. The [Cii] and [Ci] emission can in principle trace the CO-dark gas but must be calibrated because the [Cii] also arises in Hi gas, and [Ci] misses the C+–H2 regions. Models (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2010, Nordon & Sternberg 2016, Madden et al. 2020) predict the dark gas fraction should increase at lower metallicity because of reduced shielding of the CO, although Hu et al. (2021) suggest the effect of metallicity is not as large as in previous models. The trend is confirmed by observations in the Galactic disk, where the metallicity decreases by a factor of ∼2.6 between 4 kpc and 10 kpc while the CO-dark gas fraction increases by a factor of ∼4 (Pineda et al. 2013, Langer et al. 2014), and also by observations in low-metallicity galaxies (Section 8.4).',\n",

Nevertheless, it is certainly oversimplified to assume that all planetary systems have the same number of planets (e.g., Ballard & Johnson 2016, Mulders et al. 2018). Having a Poisson distribution for the intrinsic multiplicity (e.g., Lissauer et al. 2011, He et al. 2019, Sandford et al. 2019, Zink et al. 2019) is likely not justified either. The underlying assumption behind the Poisson distribution is that occurrences and properties of individual planets around the same host are independent from each other. Although it has not been proved invalid for Kepler planets, there is emerging evidence that the presence and properties of planets inside the same system may be correlated because of the shared formation environment and/or host properties (see Sections 1.1, 2.4, and 2.5). Furthermore, the exponential or power-law (i.e., Zipfian distribution; Sandford et al. 2019) forms can be securely ruled out. These distributions predict overly abundant intrinsic single-planet systems, which is not supported by TTV observations (e.g., Ford et al. 2011).',\n",

The idea is that the properties of the stochastic variations of an AGN light curve are driven by an accretion disk near the central supermassive black hole and that this variability provides an observational probe of the small scale astrophysical processes. The standard approach is to fit a GP model to the light curve—typically using a damped random walk kernel (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012), or the more general CARMA kernel (e.g., Kelly et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2022, Yu et al. 2022), because these permit efficient computations even with large data sets—and then to use the inferred hyperparameter values to constrain the variability amplitudes and timescales of the system (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012; Kelly et al. 2014; Kasliwal et al. 2017; Moreno et al. 2019; Stone et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2022).

For the most part, there is consensus among the varied theoretical efforts. Granato et al. (2000) demonstrated the importance of decoupled sites of emission of UV and IR radiation via consideration of the impact of birth cloud clearing times on their simulations. Similarly, Narayanan et al. (2018b) explicitly calculated the UV optical depths for hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution to arrive at a similar point, whereas Popping et al. (2017b) cast this result in the context of holes in obscuring dust screens, as well as the impact of increased turbulence in the obscuring ISM. In short, increasing optical depths move galaxies along the IRX–β relation (\\n\\nFigure 5\\n\\n) while increasingly decoupled star-dust geometries (i.e., a proxy for varying attenuation curves) displace galaxies vertically in IRX–β space. It is a point of consensus among theoretical models that the scatter in where star-forming galaxies present in IRX–β space is due to the diversity of underlying attenuation laws; this cause for the scatter has also been suggested in the interpretation of various observational data sets (e.g., Boquien et al. 2009, 2012; Mao et al. 2014; Álvarez-Márquez et al. 2019; Salim & Boquien 2019). What is unknown, however, is the root cause of the attenuation law variations. There is a degeneracy between variations in dust extinction curves (i.e., variations in grain sizes and/or the optical properties of grains) and the star-dust geometry in driving attenuation law variations. Both can impact the location of galaxies in the IRX–β space by modifying the attenuation curve.',\n",

       "  'text': 'In PDRs, the gas is primarily heated by photoelectrons ejected from the grains (Draine 1978). The PE heating is most efficient for the smallest sizes, particularly for the carriers of the UIBs (see, e.g., Weingartner & Draine 2001). This heating efficiency therefore depends on the dust properties and thus on the environment. Assuming that [Cii]\\n\\n is the main gas coolant, the PE efficiency, ϵPE, can be approximated by the gas-to-dust cooling ratio: ϵPE≃LCii\\n/L\\nTIR. Detailed studies usually add other lines to the gas cooling rate, such as [Oi]\\n\\n, to have a more complete estimate (see, e.g., Cormier et al. 2015). Overall, Smith et al. (2017) found that 0.1%≲ϵPE≲1%, with an average of 〈ϵPE〉≃0.5%, in a sample of 54 nearby galaxies. It appears that ϵPE is lower when the dust temperature is higher (Rubin et al. 2009, Croxall et al. 2012). This is not likely the result of the destruction of the UIB carriers, as their intensity correlates best with the [Cii]\\n\\n emission (see, e.g., Helou et al. 2001). It is conjectured, rather, to result from the saturation of grain charging in UV-bright regions. The shape of the ISRF also has consequences for the accuracy with which L\\nTIR represents the true UV PE-efficient flux. Indeed, Kapala et al. (2017) showed that the variations of ϵPE in M31 could be explained by the contribution of old stars to \\n\\n. Finally, one of the most puzzling features is that \\n\\n is higher at low metallicity (Poglitsch et al. 1995, Madden et al. 1997, Cormier et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2017), while the UIB strength drops in these systems (see Section 4.3.4). This is currently poorly understood. However, in the extreme case of I Zw 18 (Z≃1/35Z⊙), where no UIB is detected and the PE heating is estimated to be negligible, the gas-cooling-to-TIR ratio is still ≃1% (Lebouteiller et al. 2017).

Planets (see the sidebar What Is a Planet?)? Beginning with Adams et al.

In contrast, Boss (1997) argued that the direct collapse of clumps from GIs can create massive gas giant planets (see also Durisen et al. 2007, and references therein). More recently, a series of papers starting with Nayakshin (2010) have proposed that a combination of GI and tidal stripping can even produce rocky planets. Considering which disks are susceptible to GI and fragmentation reveals parameters unfavorable to the formation of planets but favorable to the formation of more massive wide-orbit companions. In Section 4, we have seen that unstable disks are massive, which leads to large initial masses for fragments; they are often undergoing rapid infall, which can enhance the subsequent growth rates; and they are experiencing rapid angular momentum transport, which can cause rapid migration and destruction of marginally bound objects (which are the most likely to be low in mass in the first place).

For example, resolved CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) observations showed that cyanides peak at different locations from other species such as CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Friedel & Snyder 2008). A differentiation between N-bearing COMs (cyanides and NH2CHO) and O-bearing COMs (alcohols, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO) has also been inferred from differences in their excitation temperatures from Herschel observations by Crockett et al. (2015), who found that the former trace hotter gas (200–300 K) than the latter (100–150 K). However, the CH3C(O)CH3 emission detected with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) resembles more the cyanide emission than that of CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Peng et al. 2013, Feng et al. 2015), two COMs that were found to be strongly spatially correlated (Brouillet et al. 2013). To complicate the situation even further, Favre et al. (2017) demonstrated with ALMA that CH3COOH and (CH2OH)2 trace a more compact region located closer to the hot core than other O-bearing COMs. Analyzing a larger sample of O-bearing COMs detected with ALMA, Tercero et al. (2018) confirmed this result and showed that there is in fact a more general spatial segregation between the COMs containing a C-O-C structure and the COMs containing a C-OH bond, the former tracing the compact ridge and the latter the hot core. Tercero et al. (2018) interpret this segregation as resulting from the chemistry being dominated by different radicals in these two regions, methoxy (CH3O·) in the former and hydroxymethyl (·CH2OH) in the latter. One caveat in these discussions is that integrated intensity maps intended to trace a particular transition of a given COM may be contaminated by emission from other species due to the complex velocity structure of the Orion KL region (Pagani et al. 2017). A more reliable method would be to construct column density maps from LTE fits of the spectrum of each pixel (e.g., using the VINE method; Calcutt et al. 2018b).',\n",

Does the Hi also cool within these structures? Simulations have shown that supershells sweep up the warm, ambient medium into dense, structured filamentary walls where the gas can cool to form CNM and molecular clumps (Koyama & Inutsuka 2000, Mac Low et al. 2005, Hopkins et al. 2012). From an observational perspective, this role is less well documented, although there have certainly been examples of supershells with associated molecular gas (e.g., Fukui et al. 1999, Dawson et al. 2008). McClure-Griffiths et al. (2003) found clumps of narrow-linewidth Hi in the walls of a large supershell, suggesting that the structures were formed by Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. Both Knee & Brunt (2001) and Moss et al. (2013) used HISA to show that the walls of two supershell structures were dominated by cold gas. The most comprehensive analysis of supershells as collectors and coolers of gas was produced by Dawson et al.

       "  'text': '\\nFrebel et al. (2007b) developed an observer-friendly formulation of early Cii and Oi metal line cooling (Bromm & Loeb 2003). They predicted that all metal-poor stars that formed through this mechanism should have carbon and/or oxygen abundances in excess of the line cooling critical metallicity. To date, all stars with [Fe/H] < −3.0 indeed show sufficiently enhanced levels of carbon and oxygen, with only one exception, SD 1029+1729 (see \\nTable 1\\n and Section 3.4). Instead, the existence of this star has been successfully explained in terms of a dust-cooling mechanism (Klessen et al. 2012, Schneider et al. 2012b, Ji et al. 2014). A more recent study has suggested that, even though both mechanisms may be important for forming the first low-mass stars, they may occur as part of separate formation pathways and/or environments (Ji et al. 2014). Detailed numerical simulations of star formation in atomic cooling halos have already suggested where these pathways may occur, although details so far remain unclear (Wise & Abel 2007, Greif et al. 2008, Ritter et al. 2012).',\n",

       "  'text': \"Spatially resolving MBHBs at subparsec separations is difficult. The most compact, directly imaged MBHB on record is the dual AGNs in the radio galaxy 0402+379, with a projected separation of 7.3 pc (Rodriguez et al. 2006). For more compact sources, photometric and spectroscopic techniques can be used to infer the presence of MBHBs. Circumbinary accretion may prove crucial for upcoming multimessenger efforts to identify such compact MBHBs in the form of periodically varying electromagnetic (EM) counterparts (e.g., Bogdanović et al. 2022, Charisi et al. 2022). The sought-after periodic signals in time-variable AGNs include (a) time-variable kinematic offsets of the broad emission lines (Gaskell 1996), (b) Doppler-boosted broad-band emission from the circumsecondary accretion disk (D'Orazio et al. 2015), (c) periodic self-lensing flares (D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018, Hu et al. 2020), and (d) broadband photometric variability due to pulsed/modulated accretion (e.g., Tang et al. 2018). In practice, the kinematics approach is of limited use at subparsec because of the confusion and truncation of the distinct broad-line regions at these separations (Kelley 2021), making the photometric approach a more viable and data-rich technique (e.g., Charisi et al. 2022). Indeed, systematic searches for periodic signals in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (Graham et al. 2015), the Palomar Transient Factory (Charisi et al. 2016), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Liu et al. 2019b) have revealed hundreds of MBHB candidates. Measuring photometric variability is not exempt from systematic uncertainties (Graham et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016, Witt et al. 2022) but has the potential of being a powerful multimessenger tool in combination with simultaneous GW detections (Charisi et al. 2022). At subparsec separations, MBHBs emit GWs in the frequencies suitable for PTAs, which are forecast to provide individual binary detections within the next decade (Mingarelli et al. 2017, Kelley et al. 2018). In this regime, the binary orbit is still essentially Newtonian, and the associated GW waveforms are well understood. Likewise, the known photometric variability mechanisms (accretion/boosting/lensing) are all modulated on timescales commensurate with the binary orbit. Simultaneous GW/photometric detection of these objects would not only conclusively prove their existence but also allow for constraints on the their orbital parameters.\",\n",

This expansion is accompanied by the onset of mass loss, which is variously modeled as an impulsive shell ejection (e.g., Shore 2014, Mason et al. 2018), a continuous wind (Kato & Hachisu 1994), or a combination of the two (e.g., Friedjung 1987). As the nova transitions through optical maximum, most spectral lines show P Cygni profiles [e.g., \\n\\nFigure 4b\\n\\n\\n, subpanel i; see also the sidebar titled Transient Heavy-Element Absorption (THEA) Features]. With time, the emission component strengthens and the absorption weakens, which is consistent with a receding photosphere. Around maximum, the ejecta are dense enough to rapidly recombine, and the Str\\n\\nmgren sphere powered by the nuclear-burning WD is ionization bounded, such that the outer ejecta are neutral (Beck et al. 1990, Williams 1990). The dominant form of opacity is line blanketing by nearly neutral metals (sometimes called the iron curtain, because most of the opacity is from Fe lines; Shore & Aufdenberg 1993, Shore et al. 1994). Modeling of spectra before and around maximum finds that the density profiles of nova ejecta require a sharp outer profile (ρ ∝ r\\n−n\\n with n ≈ 15 for the outermost ejecta; Hauschildt et al. 1994) and a much shallower profile for the inner ejecta (n ≈ 3; Hauschildt et al. 1992). This density profile implies that the optical photospheric radius can vary by over a factor of ∼100 with wavelength and thereby sample a range of temperatures and ionization states (Hauschildt et al. 1995); it is therefore often called a pseudophotosphere.\\n',\n",

The asymmetric CO disks around β Pic and Fomalhaut both exhibit gas that closely traces the location of dust continuum emission in the system, enhancing the evidence for a common second-generation origin. The edge-on β Pic disk exhibits a weak asymmetry in dust continuum emission between the northeast and southwest disk limbs that is exaggerated in CO (Dent et al. 2014), whereas the location of the CO gas in Fomalhaut's eccentric dust ring corresponds at least approximately with the location of pericenter (Matrà et al. 2017b); however, the dust emission otherwise demonstrates no deviations from axisymmetry (MacGregor et al. 2017). Among the systems with generally axisymmetric gas disks, most that have been imaged at sufficiently high resolution seem to exhibit marked differences between the radial extent of the gas and dust emission (HD 21997, HD 141569, 49 Cet, \\n\\n Crv; Kóspál et al. 2013, White et al. 2016, Hughes et al. 2017, Marshall et al. 2017), although at least one—the only F star—exhibits cospatial gas and dust (HD 181327; Marino et al. 2016).

Asteroseismic inversions to derive the latitudinal rotation law in the envelope, \\n\\n, revealed the magnitude of the angular differentiality to be larger than that for the Sun, with latitudinal shear factors between the equator and at midlatitude ranging from −1.4 to −0.27 (Benomar et al. 2018, their table S3). Such a level of observed latitudinal shear is much larger than predictions from theory and numerical simulations for the Sun and solar-like stars (Hotta et al. 2015, Brun et al. 2017). Although the 13 stars have faster average envelope rotation than the Sun, with \\n\\nHz when adopting a latitudinal rotation law as for the Sun, the asteroseismic inference of these shear values points to large anisotropy in the turbulence, accompanied by efficient angular momentum transport. These asteroseismic results remain unexplained so far. Such a level of shear is not found from the 3D numerical simulations for red giants by Brun & Palacios (2009), who derived antisolar latitudinal differential rotation and strong radial differential rotation in the slowly rotating outer envelope, as it would occur from conservation of specific angular momentum by individual convective flows. Major theoretical uncertainty in the level of radial differentiality of the rotation in convection zones remains for low-mass red giants (e.g., Kissin & Thompson 2015).',\n",

       "  'text': \"The dynamical measurements from AO images allowed the derivation of the mass of the central object with a few percent accuracy. The motion of the stars follow almost perfect Keplerian orbits, even for stars like S2 that passes the central source as close as \\n\\n (Schwarzschild radius: R\\nS = 2GM/c\\n2). Following the pericenter passage of S2 in 2002, it became clear that the first-order general relativity (GR) effects will come in reach with precision observations (Rubilar & Eckart 2001). Despite the fact that a black hole is a genuine prediction of GR, the signatures of GR on the stellar orbits with the leading post-Newtonian terms (O(β2), β = v/c), namely gravitational redshift and Schwarzschild precession, are small perturbations w.r.t. the Keplerian motion (for a review, see Alexander 2005). The gravitational redshift scales with β2 ≈ R\\nS/R. In case of S2, the effect is approximately \\n\\n compared to the maximum velocity of \\n\\n at pericenter passage. The Schwarzschild precession rotates the elliptical orbit by ≈12.1 arcmin per 16 years revolution. In order to measure the effects, a significant improvement (by a factor of 4–10) in astrometry compared to what was possible in 2010 was needed. This posed one of the main science drivers for the development of the GRAVITY instrument (Eisenhauer et al. 2008, Paumard et al. 2008). Since its first light (GRAVITY Collab. et al. 2017a), GRAVITY has been regularly observing the central S-stars and SgrA\\\\*. On May 19, 2018, S2 passed pericenter with 2.6% of the speed of light. By simultaneously monitoring the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2018a) were able to detect the gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect at high significance (later confirmed by Do et al. 2019). The statistical robustness of the redshift detection was further improved by GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2019a) to more than 20σ significance. Amorim et al. (2019) used two atomic transition lines in the spectrum of S2 to test one pillar of the Einstein equivalence principle and, thus, GR and the local position invariance (LPI). By separately measuring the redshift of the hydrogen and helium lines in the stellar spectrum, effectively two independent clocks can be probed, while moving through the black hole's gravitational potential. The results set an upper limit on a violation of the LPI of 5 × 10−2 for a change of potential that is six magnitudes larger than accessible with terrestrial experiments.\",\n",

However, intrinsic alignments can coherently antialign well-separated galaxies along the line of sight (Hirata & Seljak 2004). Subsequent observational work confirmed that this is the dominant impact of intrinsic alignments on weak lensing measurements; but it cannot be eliminated by removing galaxy pairs at the same redshift from the lensing sample. Based on recent observations (e.g., Singh & Mandelbaum 2016), intrinsic alignments will be an important systematic that surveys like LSST must mitigate (\\nFigure 7\\n). Efforts to remove this systematic typically include modeling or self-calibration in a joint cosmological analysis of galaxy–galaxy, galaxy–shear, and shear–shear correlations (DES Collab. et al. 2017, Joudaki et al. 2018, Yao et al. 2017). These approaches rely on the fact that the contributing terms have different redshift dependencies, spending some of the statistical constraining power of the data to marginalize over the intrinsic alignments terms.\\n',\n",

All these signatures fundamentally depend on the lifetime of the NS remnant, with bluer, more massive, and more energetic kilonovae without a successful jet pointing to longer-lived NSs. Although EM observations of GW170817 offer no conclusive evidence, and a long-lived or stable NS cannot be entirely ruled out on EM and GW grounds (e.g., Abbott et al. 2017b, 2020b; Piro et al. 2019; Troja et al. 2020), the presence of a blue kilonova component associated with a large mass of lanthanide-free ejecta and \\n\\n (Section 4), together with a successful relativistic jet (Section 5), strongly disfavors a prompt collapse to a BH and argues in favor of an HMNS that collapsed to a BH within a second or so after merger (Granot et al. 2017, Margalit & Metzger 2017, Shibata et al. 2017, Metzger et al. 2018, Rezzolla et al. 2018, Gill et al. 2019b, Ciolfi 2020, Murguia-Berthier et al. 2021).

This observable has the potential to yield vastly more information about reionization than any other probe (and, with additional effort, the ages that preceded reionization; Furlanetto et al. 2006, Morales & Wyithe 2010, Pritchard & Loeb 2012). Although in principle the 21-cm signal provides a tomographic image of reionization like that shown in \\nFigure 11\\n, the first generations of instruments do not have the sensitivity to make images, and we must hope instead to achieve statistical detections of the signal (McQuinn et al. 2006, although see Zaroubi et al. 2012). There is a worldwide effort to detect the z∼6–10 21-cm signal using both specialized and multipurpose interferometers, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, the Precision Array to Probe Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) primarily in the Netherlands, and the 21-cm Array in China (with planning underway for the next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) instrument and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low in South Africa and Australia, respectively; Paciga et al. 2013, van Haarlem et al. 2013, DeBoer et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2015, Dillon et al. 2015, Koopmans et al. 2015). With the exception of the Netherlands, these locations have been chosen to be as isolated as possible from anthropogenic radio transmissions that can easily contaminate this signal, a signal that from z=6–10 falls in the well-trafficked 130–210 MHz band. There are also efforts afoot attempting to detect the sky-averaged (or global) 21-cm signal from z=6–30 (Bowman & Rogers 2010, Burns et al. 2012, Bernardi et al. 2015).

This relation, known as the star-formation main sequence (SFMS) of galaxies, has been well studied using both single-aperture and IFS data at low redshift (e.g., Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007, Catalán-Torrecilla et al. 2015, Gavazzi et al. 2015, Renzini & Peng 2015, Cano-Díaz et al. 2016, Sánchez et al. 2018). In general, the SFMS has a scatter of ∼0.2–0.3 dex in SFR at any redshift, with a slope slightly smaller than one at low redshift, ∼0.8 dex/log(M\\n\\\\*). The SFMS presents a clear evolution in the zero point that increases with redshift (e.g., Speagle et al. 2014, Rodríguez-Puebla et al. 2016). By contrast, RGs are distributed well below the SFMS, following a loose relation with the M\\n\\\\* (or a cloud), broadly corresponding to the location expected for an EW(Hα) ∼ 1 Å (e.g., Stasińska et al. 2008). In between the two groups, there is an area with a much lower number density of galaxies, known as the green valley (GV). Galaxies in the GV (or GVGs) are considered in transit between SFGs and RGs, and their limited number has been interpreted as a consequence of a fast process transforming the former to the latter (e.g., Bell et al. 2004, Faber et al. 2007, Schiminovich et al. 2007). More recently, AGN hosts were found located in the GV of the SFR–M\\n\\\\* diagram (e.g., Torres-Papaqui et al. 2012, Schawinski et al. 2014, Cano-Díaz et al. 2016, Sánchez et al. 2018), as shown in \\nFigure 2\\n. Actually, their distribution is spread from the SFMS toward the RGs cloud, covering mostly the GV, and sharing many properties with GVGs (e.g., Sánchez et al. 2018).

Measurements of this quantity have, perhaps naturally, been concentrated on the most highly ionizing and highly luminous objects at a given redshift—indeed those taken in the very distant Universe are only possible for extremely powerful emission line galaxies. They have also been obtained for samples obtained through a variety of selection methods, which produce overlapping samples. For clarity, in \\nFigure 4b\\n\\n we attempt to classify the samples into four broad categories. The designated “High EW” symbols show reported sample means for galaxies selected as very luminous examples of narrowband or spectroscopically selected emission line galaxies (typically Hα emitters at cosmic noon and Lyα emitters at high redshift) (Stark et al. 2017; Matthee et al. 2018, 2021; De Barros et al. 2019; Maseda et al. 2020). “EELGs” symbols indicate galaxies selected as extreme emission line galaxies either on the basis of broadband photometry excesses or directly through spectroscopy (EELGs) (Schaerer et al. 2016; Berg et al. 2018, 2019; Chisholm et al. 2019; Onodera et al. 2020). “LyC or high [Oiii]/[Oii]” symbols show samples of galaxies identified as Lyman continuum leakers (i.e., with a measured high f\\nesc) or as having very high [Oiii]/[Oii] ratios (Schaerer et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019, 2021; Guseva et al. 2020).

The bulk density of Patroclus and Hector, both Jupiter's Trojans, was determined to be ρ=0.8–1 g cm−3 (Marchis et al. 2014, Buie et al. 2015), which is suggestive of high H2O-ice content and/or high porosity. The Patroclus and (18974) 1998 WR21 equal-size binaries are probably rare survivors of a much larger population of binaries in the outer disk (most binaries were presumably dissociated by collisions and planetary encounters). In summary, Jupiter Trojans may represent the most readily accessible repository of Kuiper belt material.

       "  'text': 'The response to the tilt of thinner disks is qualitatively different than it is to that of thick disks. In fact, when the disk thickness is smaller than the disk viscosity parameter, h/r < α, warps propagate in the disks viscously. Bardeen & Petterson (1975) predicted that this would lead to the inner parts of the accretion disk aligning with the black hole midplane and separating from the outer, misaligned part of the disk by a smooth warp (the Bardeen–Petterson effect or BP). However, at the time it was impossible to take into account the magnetized turbulence responsible for the accretion. And, though such alignment was seen in nonrelativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations (e.g., Nelson & Papaloizou 2000), general relativistic magnetized simulations of tilted disks, as thin as h/r = 0.08, have shown no sign of the BP alignment (Zhuravlev et al. 2014). Liska et al. (2019c) simulated the thinnest disk, with h/r = 0.03, tilted by 10 degrees relative to a rapidly spinning black hole, and found that the inner regions of the disk, r\\n\\n\\n 5r\\ng, aligned with the black hole. This remarkable discovery is the first demonstration of BP alignment in a general relativistic numerical simulation of a magnetized accretion disk. Importantly, the duration of these simulations is long enough for the inner regions of the accretion disk to achieve inflow equilibrium and quasi–steady state. The BP alignment was also seen in shorter nonrelativistic simulations that approximated the effects of black hole rotation via additional torques in MHD equations (Hawley & Krolik 2019) and did not include the effects of apsidal precession, which can qualitatively affect the alignment process (Nealon et al. 2016).',\n",

The former is usually parameterized in models with K\\nh, the eddy diffusivity for heat discussed earlier, whereas the latter depends upon the details of the chemical pathway. The usual approximation used in modeling this process is that the atmospheric abundance of CO is fixed at the point at which the chemical equilibrium timescale is equal to the mixing timescale, commonly known as the quench approximation (e.g., Fegley & Lodders 1996, Saumon et al. 2000, Lodders & Fegley 2002, Hubeny & Burrows 2007; see the sidebar, Quenching). An example is shown in \\nFigure 5\\n. For this model a pure equilibrium calculation would find that C in the atmosphere should be almost entirely in the form of methane above approximately 1 bar when the thermal profile has entered in the methane stability field. However, in the presence of vertical mixing, CO is transported upward and can be the dominant species when mixing is vigorous.

With the advent of space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT that provide high-quality photometric data over a long time series, it has now become feasible to detect solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of stars (Stello et al. 2013, 2015). Typically, the power spectrum of a star with solar-like oscillations (\\nFigure 10) shows a regular pattern of modes, characterized by a large frequency separation Δν. The overall amplitude is modulated by a Gaussian envelope, and this is characterized by the frequency of maximum oscillation νmax. Theory suggests that Δν for a given star is related to its density (Ulrich 1986), whereas the νmax is related to its surface gravity and temperature (Brown et al. 1991, Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). Using the above two relations, the mass and the radius of a star can be constrained. The mass of a red giant is sensitive to its age, and this makes asteroseismology very useful for understanding Galactic evolution (Chaplin et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2016).

Numerical simulations can reproduce much of the observed structure and time-dependent dynamics in the nonmagnetic chromosphere (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). However, many simulations tend to produce a highly intermittent state, i.e., hot shocks surrounded by larger regions that may be too dark and cool to produce the steady emission seen in many chromospheric spectral lines (Kalkofen 2012). No matter the role of acoustic waves/shocks in the chromospheric energy budget, their dissipation tends not to leave much power available at larger heights to heat the corona (Athay & White 1978, Cranmer et al. 2007). Thus, in recent years the focus has shifted heavily to magnetic fields and MHD fluctuations as a primary heating mechanism for both the chromosphere (Jess et al. 2015) and corona (Section 5.3).',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nAbbot et al. (2012) discussed how a carbonate-silicate cycle could be maintained with up to 95% of a planet's surface covered by water, suggesting by extrapolation a possible CO2 cycling for Type 2 waterworlds via the rocky ocean floor. Such planet models show a varying timescale for a carbon cycle, depending on their initial carbon inventory and temperature (Foley 2015). However, for Type 1 waterworlds, that is, super-Earths with water mass fractions like those of Earth or higher, the deep oceans are separated from the rocky interior via a layer of high-pressure ices. Therefore, an alternative mechanism to modulate abundant gases like CO2 and CH4 would be required in waterworlds. Such a mechanism would depend on the properties of their clathration in water over a range of very high pressures. Under very high pressures (above 0.6 GPa), common to super-Earth-sized water planets, clathrates undergo a phase transition in their structure to a form known as filled ice that can transport CH4 and CO2 (Levi et al. 2013, 2017). This should enable effective cycling of CO2 through the atmosphere and oceans on water planets residing in the HZ (e.g., with water oceans at the surface) and thus provide an alternative atmospheric concentration feedback mechanism to regulate CO2 on water planets. The timescales and effectiveness of such cycling is still an open question (Kitzmann et al. 2015, Levi et al. 2017). A lively debate in the literature addresses how the interiors of such worlds might work, regarding the ability to cycle gases from the rocky core to the atmosphere (Valencia et al. 2007; Grasset et al. 2009; Fu et al. 2010; Rogers & Seager 2010; Kaltenegger et al. 2013; Tackley et al. 2013; Levi et al. 2013, 2017) and whether such planets could be habitats (Abbot 2016, Abbot et al. 2012, Kaltenegger et al. 2013, Noack et al. 2016). First analyses of what atmospheric spectra of waterworlds might look like and whether they could be distinguished from land-dominated worlds even in transit, where surface albedo would not be detectable, depend strongly on whether long-term CO2 cycling can be maintained (Kaltenegger et al. 2013).\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Assuming the monomers are present, the full kinetic models of Boulangier et al. (2019) favor Al2O3 as the primary dust precursor candidate owing to the high temperature at which nucleation can occur (∼1,800 K). However, if one starts from an atomic mixture, an acute problem arises because the concentration of the Al2O3 monomer is almost negligible in the relevant temperature range, and most of the aluminum is in the atomic form. These results suggest that among the possible candidates, TiO2 clusters are the only possible dust precursors. However, the kinetic temperature corresponding to the spatial regions where dust is found is roughly 1,500–2,000 K (Norris et al. 2012, Khouri et al. 2016), well above the formation temperature of (TiO2)\\nN\\n = 10, which is around 1,000–1,200 K. Furthermore, a significantly larger fraction of presolar grains of AGB origin contain Al2O3 rather than TiO2 grains (Choi et al. 1998, Stroud et al. 2004, Bose et al. 2010), although the expected smaller size of TiO2 grains makes them more difficult to detect. So, alternative routes are now being explored to determine whether larger (Al2O3)\\nn\\n clusters can form bypassing the monomer, and using, for example, the (Al2O3)2 dimer as the main building block, where the dimer is formed from oxidation reactions of the abundant Al2O2 molecule with AlO, AlOH, OH, and H2O (D. Gobrecht, J. Plane, and L. Decin, in preparation). Another possibility might be that large clusters can exist at higher kinetic temperatures than currently suggested by the model calculations, because of thermo-ionic electron emission (Demyk et al. 2004), or possibly radiative cooling (potentially via recurrent fluorescence or vibrational radiative cooling) rather than dissociating. The Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman (1959) famously used as the title of his talk presented to the American Physical Society in Pasadena on December 29, 1959, There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom. This statement remains a stellar example of physics prognostication; much of that room has yet to be explored.\",\n",

       "  'question': ' How does the specific star formation rate of galaxies evolve with redshift and stellar mass, and what are the implications for galaxy growth and the cosmic star formation history?',\n",
       "  'text': 'In recent years, there has been considerable interest in the sSFR (sSFR≡SFR/M∗) of galaxies with different masses at different times in the history of the Universe. The sSFR describes the fractional growth rate of stellar mass in a galaxy or, equivalently, the ratio of current to past star formation. The inverse of the sSFR is the characteristic stellar mass doubling time (Guzman et al. 1997). At 0<z<2 and quite possibly at higher redshifts, most star-forming galaxies follow a reasonably tight relation between SFR and M∗, whose normalization (e.g., the mean sSFR at some fiducial mass) decreases steadily with cosmic time (decreasing redshift) at least from z = 2 to the present (Brinchmann et al. 2004, Daddi et al. 2007, Elbaz et al. 2007, Noeske et al. 2007). A minority population of starburst galaxies exhibits elevated sSFRs, whereas quiescent or passive galaxies lie below the SFR-M∗ correlation. For the “main sequence” of star-forming galaxies, most studies find that the average sSFR is a mildly declining function of stellar mass (e.g., Karim et al. 2011). This implies that more massive galaxies completed the bulk of their star formation earlier than that did lower-mass galaxies (Brinchmann & Ellis 2000, Juneau et al. 2005), a “downsizing” picture first introduced by Cowie et al. (1996). Dwarf galaxies continue to undergo major episodes of activity. The tightness of this SFR-M∗ correlation has important implications for how star formation is regulated within galaxies and perhaps for the cosmic SFH. Starburst galaxies, whose SFRs are significantly elevated above the main-sequence correlation, contribute only a small fraction of the global SFRD at z⩽2 (Rodighiero et al. 2011, Sargent et al. 2012). Instead, the evolution of the cosmic SFR is primarily due to the steadily evolving properties of main-sequence disk galaxies.',\n",

This model has matured over the years into a strong line of theoretical research focused on the detailed physics of how the thermal, hydrodynamic, and ionization states of CGM gas evolve in dark matter halos. Placing multiphase gas into the context of the dark matter halo, Maller & Bullock (2004) suggested cold clouds cooled out of thermal instabilities in a hot medium while maintaining rough pressure equilibrium [though see Binney et al. (2009) for a counterpoint]. Accretion may also be seeded by gas ejected from the disk, as in the galactic fountain or precipitation model (e.g., Fraternali & Binney 2008, Voit et al. 2015b). These scenarios start with very simple assumptions—such as hydrostatic hot halos, diffuse clouds in PIE, or particular radial entropy profiles. These simplifying assumptions are necessary because we do not know the large-scale physical state of the CGM as a whole. Photoionization modeling of the low-ionization CGM using only the EUVB (Haardt & Madau 2001) strongly disfavors hydrostatic equilibrium with hot gas at T\\nvir (Werk et al. 2014); the cool and hot phases appear to have similar densities, rather than similar pressures. Furthermore, if Ovi-traced gas follows a hydrostatic profile at the temperature where its ionization fraction peaks, T ∼105.5 K, then its column density profile would be significantly steeper than observed (Tumlinson et al. 2011). There may be other means of supporting this gas, such as turbulence (Fielding et al. 2017), cosmic rays (Salem et al. 2016), or magnetic fields.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Many of the most advanced hydrodynamic simulations today have shown that it is possible for baryonic feedback to erase the central cusps shown in the density profiles in \\nFigure 4\\n and produce core-like density profiles as inferred from rotation curves such as those shown in \\nFigure 9\\n (Mashchenko et al. 2008, Pontzen & Governato 2012, Madau et al. 2014, Oñorbe et al. 2015, Read et al. 2016). One key prediction is that the effect of core creation will vary with the mass in stars formed (Governato et al. 2012, Di Cintio et al. 2014). If galaxies form enough stars, there will be enough energy from supernovae to redistribute DM and create significant cores. If too many baryons end up in stars, however, the excess central mass can compensate and drag DM back in. At the other extreme, if too few stars are formed, there will not be enough energy in supernovae to alter halo density structure, and the resultant DM distribution will resemble DM-only simulations. Although the possible importance of supernova-driven blowouts for the central DM structure of dwarf galaxies was already appreciated by Navarro et al. (1996) and Gnedin & Zhao (2002), an important recent development is the understanding that even low-level star formation over an extended period can drive gravitational potential fluctuations that lead to DM core formation.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Dynamical modeling of supermassive black holes has a long history and has been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Kormendy & Richstone 1995, Kormendy & Ho 2013). The kinematics can be measured from either stars or gas in the vicinity of the black hole. For stellar-dynamical modeling, state-of-the-art codes use Schwarzschild modeling (Schwarzschild 1979) to jointly model the mass density of the central black hole, stars, and dark matter by orbit superposition (e.g., Rix et al. 1997, Gebhardt et al. 2003). The stellar-mass profile is modeled from the light, which is then converted to a mass profile by solving for the stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/L), and if needed a dark matter halo component is also independently fitted (e.g., Gebhardt & Thomas 2009). The orbit families are weighted to match the spatially resolved stellar kinematical measurements. A major issue for all dynamical models is distinguishing between orbital anisotropy and mass (e.g., a black hole). This mass–anisotropy degeneracy is well known (e.g., Binney & Mamon 1982). Other (related) issues include: (a) degeneracy between the stellar M/L and the black hole mass, (b) incomplete stellar orbit libraries, and (c) the assumption of axisymmetry (van den Bosch & de Zeeuw 2010). The systematic uncertainties for black hole masses from gas dynamics are qualitatively different than they are for stellar dynamics, but given the large systematics for both kinds of analysis, we use them interchangeably in our discussion (although see a more complete discussion in Walsh et al. 2013).',\n",

In all such cases the centimeter-wavelength radio variations lagged behind the γ-ray variations by about 100 days. The F-GAMMA results also showed that the lag decreases with wavelength, falling to zero by \\n\\n GHz. It is therefore clear that in some AGNs, the γ-ray emission regions are indeed closer to the SMBH than the radio emission regions. However, there are also observations that show that in some AGNs, the γ-ray and radio emission regions are colocated (Jorstad et al. 2001, Marscher et al. 2011, Jorstad & Marscher 2016, Rani et al. 2018). It appears, therefore, that γ-ray emission from AGNs occurs at a variety of sites, some close to the SMBH and some close to the radio-emitting regions. Nalewajko et al.

Observational evidence for such an association has accumulated in recent years, with the recognition that essentially all LLAGNs are radio loud (Falcke et al. 2000, Nagar et al. 2000, Ho 2002) and the parallel discovery that virtually every BHB in a hard state has radio emission (Corbel et al. 2000; Fender 2001, 2006; Fender et al. 2004). Because all these systems may have hot accretion flows (Section 4.2), a direct causal connection between hot flows and radio-emitting jets seems likely. In contrast, jets are much weaker and are often not seen in systems that have cool geometrically thin disks. Although there is no definitive explanation for this dichotomy, three effects likely play a role: (a) Compared with thin disks, geometrically thick disks more easily advect the magnetic field to the black hole (Livio et al. 1999, Guilet & Ogilvie 2012); (b) the Bernoulli parameter of the gas in hot accretion flows is larger, hence enhancing winds in these systems (Narayan & Yi 1994, 1995a; Blandford & Begelman 1999); and (c) strong winds help to collimate and stabilize the jet (Appl & Camenzind 1992, 1993; Beskin & Malyshkin 2000).',\n",

In XTE J1810−197 (the first detected radio-emitting magnetar), pulsations were observed after, but not before, its 2003 outburst. The radio pulsations disappeared in late 2008 with no prior secular decrease in radio flux (Camilo et al. 2016). Behavior in the other sources is similar (Camilo et al. 2007a, Levin et al. 2012). The persistent (i.e., nontransient) magnetars and several other transient magnetars have been searched for radio pulsations but with no detections (e.g., Lazarus et al. 2012, Tong et al. 2013b). In the four magnetars with confirmed radio pulsations, the radio emission in all cases is very bright and shows large pulse-to-pulse variability, with pulse morphologies, both single and average, that can be broad and that generally change enormously on timescales of minutes. They can be punctuated by spiky peaks that can be much shorter than the pulse period. This radio emission is also highly linearly polarized, with polarization fractions of 60–100%.

Several aspects of the UFDs make them critical objects to understand, with potentially wide-ranging implications. First, UFDs reside in the smallest dark matter halos yet found. Although only the mass at the very center of the halo is currently measurable, the extrapolated virial masses of UFDs are ∼109 M\\n\\n (e.g., Strigari et al. 2008), and the halo masses at the time when the stars formed may have been ∼108 M\\n\\n (e.g., Bovill & Ricotti 2009, Safarzadeh et al. 2018). UFDs are also the most dark matter–dominated systems known. This combination of small halo mass and negligible baryonic mass makes UFDs extremely valuable laboratories for constraining the nature of dark matter. Simply counting the number of such objects around the Milky Way places a limit on the mass of the dark matter particle (e.g., Jethwa et al. 2018). The census and observed mass function of low-mass halos point the direction toward solving the long-standing and highly contentious missing satellite problem (e.g., Klypin et al. 1999, Moore et al. 1999, Simon & Geha 2007, Brooks et al. 2013, Kim et al. 2018). The measured central densities, and perhaps eventually the density profiles, of UFDs provide significant clues to the behavior of dark matter on small scales (e.g., Calabrese & Spergel 2016, Bozek et al. 2019, Errani et al. 2018).',\n",

       "  'text': '\\nWang et al. (2010) measured dynamical masses using CO emission from 8 quasar hosts at z ∼ 6. Assuming an average inclination angle of 40 deg and R = 2.5kpc, they found that the z ∼ 6 quasars have, on average, SMBHs a factor of 15 more massive than expected from the local BH–bulge mass relation. This result suggests that BHs in high-redshift quasars either got a major head-start or grew faster than their host galaxies; if the M–σ relation existed at z ∼ 6, then it would show a strong cosmic evolution. Numerous subsequent works have focused on the correlation of SMBH mass and galaxy dynamical mass at these redshifts (e.g., Wang et al. 2016, Decarli et al. 2018). Most of these studies had to assume an inclination angle and/or an average size for the emitting gas. Neeleman et al. (2021) carried out careful dynamic modeling of their \\n\\n observations (including inclination and size). They found a mean dynamical mass of ∼5 × 1010 M⊙ for a sample of luminous z ∼ 6 quasars with ∼109 M⊙ BHs. As shown in \\nFigure 10\\n, this places them about one order of magnitude above the local relation. It is important to note that the relationship could be strongly affected by potential biases from selection and by using gas tracers (Volonteri & Stark 2011, Huang et al. 2018). Indeed, observations of low luminosity quasars show a narrower \\n\\n line width (e.g., Willott et al. 2017, Izumi et al. 2018), placing them close to the local relation.\\n',\n",

This leads to more precise measurements of known PK parameters and the detection of new ones, greatly increasing the sample of NS mass measurements and the number of GR tests in different systems. Furthermore, improved receiver sensitivities and larger bandwidth, together with multibeaming, increase the general sensitivity to all sorts of pulsars, as in the case of the phenomenally successful Parkes multibeam (PMB) surveys (Manchester et al. 2001). Since then, the newer generation of post-PMB surveys like the new HTRU-South (Keith et al. 2010) and North surveys (Barr et al. 2013), the Green Bank drift scan survey (Boyles et al. 2013, Lynch et al. 2013), the Green Bank North Celestial Cap survey (Stovall et al. 2014), the Arecibo ALFA survey (Cordes et al. 2006, Lazarus 2013), and the Arecibo 327-MHz drift-scan survey (Deneva et al. 2013) has been making full use of much improved data-handling capabilities and processing power to obtain a large increase in spectral and time resolution (at a cost of 100 times the data rate).

       "  'text': \"Theoretical predictions of LISA event rates for merging massive BHs have been derived from numerous semianalytical models as well as more recently from cosmological galaxy evolution simulations. The predictions span a wide range, from no detectable events in the most pessimistic case up to several tens of events per year per unit redshift at z = 10, and a few events per year even at \\n\\n in the most optimistic models (for recent predictions see, e.g., Klein et al. 2016, Hartwig et al. 2018a, Ricarte & Natarajan 2018; for earlier studies that included the \\n\\n Universe see, e.g., Sesana et al. 2007, Tanaka & Haiman 2009 and references therein). The most pessimistic scenario is for stellar-mass BHs to stay below LISA's detection threshold and for massive seed BHs to form inefficiently or to be unable to promptly merge when their hosts merge. The largest rates arise when abundant stellar-mass BH seeds are assumed to grow above LISA's \\n\\n103–4 M⊙ detection threshold by z ∼ 10 or in models in which massive seeds are assumed to form efficiently in a large fraction of ACHs. Aside from the total event rates, the mass spectrum is expected to depend on the seeding and should help disentangle models. LISA data can indeed distinguish between a wide variety of models that include different prescriptions for seed formation, feedback, accretion efficiency, and accretion geometry (Sesana et al. 2011). LISA may also be able to probe SMS star formation itself by measuring mergers of the remnants of binary SMSs (Hartwig et al. 2018a) or directly detecting their formation process, via either the burst accompanying the collapse of a rotating SMS into a single massive BH (Saijo & Hawke 2009, Shibata et al. 2016) or the breakup of such an SMS producing two massive BHs, which subsequently inspiral and merge (Reisswig et al. 2013).\",\n",

       "  'text': 'Redshifted Lyα remains a mainstay for high-redshift spectroscopic confirmations. A small population of galaxies with redshifts 7.5 ≳ z ≳ 8 have been confirmed, often selected from HST CANDELS imaging. These include an early discovery of Lyα emission at z = 7.51 (Finkelstein et al. 2013), which also has a grism continuum measurement of the Lyman break (Tilvi et al. 2016). Over the next few years, this object was followed by a range of Lyα emitters spectroscopically confirmed at z = 7.45–8 (Oesch et al. 2015, Roberts-Borsani et al. 2016, Song et al. 2016b, Hoag et al. 2017, Stark et al. 2017, Larson et al. 2018, Jung et al. 2019), including a gamma-ray burst host galaxy at z = 7.8 (Tanvir et al. 2018) and a primitive galaxy group at z = 7.7 (Tilvi et al. 2020). Recently, a large-scale campaign with Keck/MOSFIRE using 10 nights targeted six dozen systems, achieving 10 detections at redshifts z = 7.1–8.2 (Jung et al. 2020; see also Pentericci et al. 2018). The demonstrated ability to spectroscopically confirm high-redshift galaxies using near-UV emission lines redward of Lyα was a hallmark achievement for the study of early galaxies. As discussed in Section 2.7, the presence of neutral hydrogen in the IGM during the cosmic reionization process can substantially attenuate Lyα. Having other available lines for spectroscopic redshift confirmation may therefore be critical during the reionization process and at earlier times. Stark et al. (2015a) detected Ciii] 1909 Å in galaxies at z ∼ 6.029 and z = 7.213 with known Lyα redshifts. Stark et al. (2015b) detected Civ 1243 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα redshift of z = 7.045. Laporte et al. (2017) detected Lyα and Ciii] in a z ∼ 6.8 galaxy. At slightly lower redshift, an interesting discovery for understanding the internal ionizing spectrum of star-forming galaxies was the confirmation of Civ 1550 Å and Oiii] λ = 1666 Å in a galaxy with known Lyα z = 6.11 (Mainali et al. 2017). The presence of Ciii] has now been confirmed in galaxies at z = 7.51 (Hutchison et al. 2019; same object as Finkelstein et al. 2013), z = 7.73 (Stark et al. 2017; same object as Oesch et al. 2015), and recently z = 7.945 (Topping et al. 2021).',\n",

       "  'text': 'How can gas fragment to small scales? There are at least two possible mechanisms: (a) If the cooling time t\\ncool falls far below the sound-crossing time t\\nsc ∼ R/c\\n\\ns\\n in a cooling cloud, causing it to become strongly underpressured relative to surrounding hot gas, P\\ncloud ≪ P\\nhot, the cloud-crushing shock can shatter the cloud (McCourt et al. 2018). These authors argued that similar to the Jeans instability, where gravitational fragmentation leads to a characteristic scale λJ ∼ c\\ns\\nt\\nff, fragmentation in cooling, pressure-confined clouds imprints a scale ℓcloudlet∼c\\ns\\nt\\ncool ∼ 0.1pc(n/cm−3)−1, where the quantity c\\ns\\nt\\ncool is evaluated at its minimum at T ∼ 104 K. Although this length scale depends on the ambient pressure confining the clouds, the column density through an individual fragment N\\ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 is essentially independent of environment. Cooling of large (R ≫ c\\ns\\nt\\ncool) clouds that subsequently shatter is easily triggered by large nonlinear perturbations (e.g., via turbulence). Shocks are particularly effective at shattering cold gas, via either compression of preexisting cold gas (Mellema et al. 2002) or fragmentation in the radiative shock (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Shattering can also arise during initially isobaric linear thermal instability,\\n24\\n once the cloud loses sonic contact with its surroundings as it cools (Gronke & Oh 2020b, Das et al. 2021). (b) Another avenue for producing small cloudlets is via mixing in KH instabilities; the tails of clouds in winds show a plethora of dense small clumps (Cooper et al. 2009, McCourt et al. 2018, Sparre et al. 2019), which have a column density distribution that peaks at Ncloudlet ∼ 1017cm−2 (Liang & Remming 2020), corresponding to the characteristic scale l ∼ c\\n\\ns\\n\\nt\\ncool suggested for cooling driven fragmentation. \\nFigure 11\\n shows fragmentation by these two respective processes. Shattering due to thermal instability in halo merger shocks can produce very low-metallicity LLSs, far from any galaxy (Mandelker et al. 2019b). Numerical resolution obviously affects the onset and efficiency of shattering, but it can even affect the multiphase nature of gas. Mandelker et al. (2021) find that if c\\ns\\nt\\ncool at T ∼ 105 K is unresolved, gas piles up at T ∼ 105 K as further cooling becomes inefficient.\\n',\n",

The conclusion that most Pop III SNe were CCSNe is consistent with the work of Mapelli et al. (2006), who compute the expected density of intermediate-mass black holes in the Galaxy by assuming they are the relics of higher-mass Pop III stars. This allows them to derive an upper limit from the nondetection of ultraluminous X-ray sources in the Milky Way. The approach has been extended by de Bennassuti et al. (2014, 2017), who also include the Galactic metallicity function and the abundances of EMP stars. Again these data appear inconsistent with PISNe being important (although see Salvadori et al. 2019 for a contrary view). Taken together, these studies suggest that most Pop III stars forming through the standard pathway outlined in Section 3.2 are not likely to reach masses significantly above ∼40M⊙, with more massive objects being extremely rare and possibly being the result of collisions in very dense clusters (see Section 5.3).',\n",

       "  'text': 'As explained above, two categories of methods are used to estimate fC\\n. The first category includes all methods for measuring the covering factor of individual objects (see Section 3): the L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method, the EW(K\\nα\\n) method, and the method based on the scattered X-ray continuum. The L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method results in the largest number of measured fC\\n. The second category includes methods that apply to the mean covering factor of the population. This is obtained by classifying a source as either a type-I or a type-II AGN and using the resulting N\\ntype-II,L\\n/N\\ntype-I,L\\n ratio as an estimate of the mean value of fC\\n. One such method measures the X-ray-absorbing column and determines the AGN type relative to a fiducial absorbing column that separates the groups (e.g., Ueda et al. 2003, Gilli et al. 2007, Hasinger 2008, Brightman & Ueda 2012, Malizia et al. 2012). Another method counts the number of broad- and narrow-emission-line AGNs in optical and IR-selected samples. Ideally, all methods should agree but this is not the case (e.g., Lawrence & Elvis 2010; Lusso et al. 2013, 2014; Mayo & Lawrence 2013). Mixed results are due to poorly understood physics of the torus, various selection effects, uncertainties in estimating L\\nAGN, and intrinsic reddening, among others. For example, the L\\ndust/L\\nAGN method is based on dust emission from the torus and has little to do with BLR properties. However, X-ray absorption by gas in the BLR can increase the total measured X-ray column, thus decreasing L\\ndust because the ionizing radiation absorbed by the dust-free gas never interacts with the dusty torus. Here I focus on the large-sample approach, in particular on X-ray based studies.',\n",

       "  'text': 'Most, if not all, stars form in star clusters and are expected to be temporally and spatially correlated, eventually driving superbubbles with more efficient energy coupling and momentum generation (e.g., Mac Low & McCray 1988, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Sharma et al. 2014). The typical velocity dispersion in newly born star clusters is ∼1 km s−1 or 1 pc Myr−1. Assuming the cluster becomes unbound, massive stars can travel up to 40 pc before they explode (assuming typical supernova delay times for single stellar populations). These walkaway stars can therefore easily leave their dense birthplaces and explode in lower-density regions. As most of the volume of the ISM is not in the cold phase, most supernovae might explode in the warm or hot phase, significantly changing the coupling efficiency (Slyz et al. 2005, Ceverino & Klypin 2009). There is also the runaway star population (Gies & Bolton 1986) (about 45% of O stars and 15% of B stars are runaways) with typical velocities of ∼30–40 km s−1 and maximum velocities as high as a few hundred kilometers per second (e.g., Silva & Napiwotzki 2011). These high-velocity stars originate from close binary systems becoming unbound by a supernova explosion (Zwicky 1957, Blaauw 1961) and/or from dynamical interactions in dense regions of star clusters (Poveda et al. 1967). They can travel up to several hundreds of parsecs away from their birthplaces far into interarm regions or the lower galactic halo. Their explosion locations in galactic disks can therefore be considered as almost random, similar to the explosions of type Ia supernovae, which contribute about 20–25% to the supernova rate in the Solar Neighborhood (Tammann et al. 1994). They explode independently of the gas mass distribution within the ISM, a process approximately taken into account in high-resolution simulations of stratified disks that are most useful to study the launching of outflows and, at the same time, create a realistically structured ISM (e.g., de Avillez & Breitschwerdt 2005, Joung & Mac Low 2006, Hill et al. 2012, Li et al. 2017). Such detailed small-scale simulations with a realistic ISM structure will help to bridge the gap in scale and physical understanding to galaxy-scale simulations.',\n",

       "  'text': 'The level of realism achieved by state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the galaxy population has advanced dramatically in the past decade. Despite this success, the outcomes are particularly sensitive to subgrid implementations of feedback processes. It is thus reasonable to argue that this success suffices only to establish that the basic sketch of galaxy-formation theory within the ΛCDM cosmogony is plausible. The development of simulations that can be used to stress test a truly comprehensive theory of galaxy formation and evolution will require confrontation of the devil in the details. Simulations of the galaxy population do not accurately reproduce the internal and vertical structure of galaxies and their reliance on subgrid methods to approximate the influence of unresolved physics leaves lingering degeneracies that diminish predictive power. Furthermore, the simulations neglect physical processes known to be significant in certain regimes. From our suite of examples, only IllustrisTNG models magnetic fields, which could impact cosmic gas flows and thus affect the evolution of galaxies (Pillepich et al. 2018a, van de Voort et al. 2021). The omission of magnetic fields also precludes realistic modeling of the influence of cosmic rays, which, owing to their ISM energy density being comparable with those of the thermal and magnetic pressures, likely influence galaxy-wide outflows (Uhlig et al. 2012). Similarly, thermal conduction influences the structure of the ICM and cooling onto massive galaxies (Carilli & Taylor 2002) but is generally neglected. Modeling the UVB as a spatially uniform radiation field that “switches on” at a fixed redshift is a particularly crude approximation for the evolution of galaxies during the EoR, when local sources of ionizing radiation can dominate the regulation of galaxy growth (Wise & Cen 2009, Trebitsch et al. 2017, Katz et al. 2020). Locally varying radiation fields, such as those produced by flickering AGNs, can also overionize gas and lead to cooling rates being overestimated by orders of magnitude if equilibrium conditions are assumed (Vasiliev 2011, Richings et al. 2014).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Age-dating stars is a fraught problem (Soderblom et al. 2014), so the conclusions we draw must be regarded as somewhat tentative, though the situation has improved considerably in the past few years. By far the most comprehensively studied region is the Orion complex. The young stars in Orion are spread over several tens of parsecs, but molecular gas and ongoing star formation are limited to a smaller ∼10 pc region around the ONC, which is ≈1 pc in size (Hillenbrand & Hartmann 1998 find \\n\\n pc) and is centered on \\n\\n Ori C, the most massive star in the complex. The ONC is the densest region, and, despite its small volume, represents a significant fraction of the total number of stars in the complex. We illustrate one recent measurement of the age distribution in Orion in \\nFigure 13\\n, which suggests three important conclusions that apply to other star-forming regions as well (e.g., Tan et al. 2006, Azimlu et al. 2015, Caldwell & Chang 2018, Getman et al. 2018). First, the densest regions show age spreads that are substantially larger than their dynamical times. Using the ages shown in \\nFigure 13\\n, the time over which 90% of the ONC stars formed is ≈6 Myr (other studies give similar results: Reggiani et al. 2011, Da Rio et al. 2016, Beccari et al. 2017), whereas the free-fall time is ≈0.6 Myr (Tan et al. 2006, Da Rio et al. 2014). Consequently, star formation has been ongoing for ≈10 free-fall times. Although the absolute ages and the magnitude of the age spread depend on the choice of age indicator, the conclusion that there is a substantial age spread is robust against this choice and against possible contamination due to photometric variability (Messina et al. 2017) or variable accretion histories (see the sidebar titled False Age Spreads for Accreting Young Stellar Objects?). This conclusion is also bolstered by kinematic observations showing that the ONC is very close to virial equilibrium (Kim et al. 2019), implying that it must have had time to relax dynamically.\\n',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\n2.3.1.2. Secular interactions.\\nSecular interactions are slow exchanges of angular momentum between widely separated planets. Secular interactions take place over thousands or even millions of years, depending on the separation and mass of the planets involved. Through secular interactions, a Jupiter can deposit its angular momentum into other planets or stars in the system on a timescale of many orbits. Planets can swap angular momentum periodically (e.g., Petrovich 2015b) or chaotically (e.g., Wu & Lithwick 2011, Hamers et al. 2017), driving the Jupiter's eccentricity to large values. The latter scenario requires three or more planets and is known as secular chaos. (Chaos can occur in hierarchical two-planet systems as well, but it requires large eccentricities and inclinations; see Wu & Lithwick 2011 for a discussion.) Kozai–Lidov cycles are a type of periodic angular momentum exchange that also trade off mutual inclination and eccentricity (Kozai 1962, Lidov 1962, Naoz 2016). Kozai–Lidov cycles can also occur in an initially coplanar system when the outer body is on a highly elliptical orbit (Li et al. 2014b). Kozai–Lidov cycles driven by a star (e.g., Wu & Murray 2003, Fabrycky & Tremaine 2007, Katz et al. 2011, Naoz et al. 2012, Petrovich 2015a) or planet (e.g., Naoz et al. 2011; see Teyssandier et al. 2013 for distinctions between planet–planet and planet–star Kozai) have been widely hypothesized to trigger high-eccentricity tidal migration of hot Jupiters. In another scenario, multiple secular frequencies within a system coincide, creating a secular resonance that elevates planets' eccentricities (e.g., Minton & Malhotra 2011, Xu & Lai 2016). Examples of several types of secular excitation interactions are shown in \\nFigure 3\\n.\",\n",

Some of these simulations are beginning to find Milky Way look-alikes in terms of their merger history, as reported, for example, by Fattahi et al. (2019). Large, fully cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, such as the Illustris suite and its successor IllustrisTNG (Naiman et al. 2018, Nelson et al. 2019) also contain Milky Way–like galaxies. The largest EAGLE cosmological simulation (Schaye et al. 2015), for example, contains 100 objects that are close analogs to the Milky Way in terms of stellar and dark mass, SFR, and bulge-to-disk ratio, of which a handful have dynamically similar stellar halos (see Bignone et al. 2019).',\n",

       "  'text': \"These direct detections of LBV-like progenitors and of pre-SN outbursts provide unambiguous evidence for violent eruptive mass loss associated with the latest phases in a massive star's life. This only occurs in ∼9% of core-collapse SNe (Smith et al. 2011b). The extremely short timescale of only a few years probably hints at severe instability in the final nuclear burning sequences, especially Ne and O burning (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Quataert & Shiode 2012, Shiode & Quataert 2014, Smith & Arnett 2014), each of which lasts about 1 year. These instabilities may be exacerbated in the most massive stars, although much theoretical work remains to be done. The increased instability at very high initial masses is extreme in cases in which pre-SN eruptions result from the PPI (Woosley et al. 2002, 2007), but eruptions may extend to other nuclear burning instabilities as well (Arnett & Meakin 2011, Smith & Arnett 2014). Although the events listed above are just a few lucky cases, they may also be the tip of the iceberg. Undoubtedly, continued work on the flood of new transient discoveries will reveal more of these cases. [Indeed, as this review went to press, Fraser et al. (2013b) reported the recovery in archival data of an outburst one year before the SN IIn-P 2011ht.] The limitation will be the existence of high-quality archival data over long timescales of years before the SNe, but these sorts of archives are becoming more populated and improved as time passes. When the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope arrives, it may become routine to detect pre-SN outbursts, although constraining their physical nature with spectra will still be a challenge.\",\n",

       "  'text': 'An axiomatic feature of most torus models is that the obscuring gas and dust are broadly symmetric along the rotation axis of the accretion flow. This is motivated by the presence of ionization cones observed in NLR gas (e.g., Zakamska et al. 2006, Fischer et al. 2013) and hidden BLRs in some Seyfert 2 galaxies (see Section 2.1.2). However, recent high-resolution observations of a handful of nearby AGN tori using mid-IR interferometry have revealed the presence of substantial dust emission along the polar direction on parsec scales (e.g., Hönig et al. 2012, Tristram et al. 2014, López-Gonzaga et al. 2016). These polar structures can extend to larger scales, as shown by imaging observations (e.g., Asmus et al. 2016). The physical origin of these features is still unclear but may be associated with an AGN-driven outflow (e.g., Schartmann et al. 2014). In addition, recent observations have cast some doubt on the notion of a compact torus being the sole origin of reflected X-ray emission, as is often assumed in the modeling of obscured AGN (e.g., Murphy & Yaqoob 2009, Brightman & Nandra 2011). Spatially resolved Chandra observations have found evidence for Fe Kα lines produced up to ≈1 kpc away from the nucleus (e.g., Bauer et al. 2015, Fabbiano et al. 2017). Taken together, these results suggest that emission features that have previously been attributed to a compact, axisymmetric torus may often originate from gas and dust with very different geometries. Obscuring material on larger scales may be associated with nuclear starbursts, which are discussed in Section 4.2.',\n",

Cases where lines are likely in non-LTE include millimeter observations of the disk atmosphere and rovibrational lines. A common approach in these cases is to use an LVG (Large Velocity Gradient) approximation (Piétu et al. 2007, van der Tak et al. 2007) or Monte Carlo–based radiative transfer codes (Brinch & Hogerheijde 2010, Hogerheijde & van der Tak 2000) coupled with an observation simulator to extract molecular abundances.

For IR lines, fast line ray tracers can also be coupled to thermochemical codes to predict the rich line emission from disk regions with large velocity gradients (Pontoppidan et al. 2009, Bosman et al. 2017, Woitke et al. 2018).

The largest single cold gas surveys in the nearby Universe are xGASS (Catinella et al. 2010, 2012, 2013, 2018) and xCOLD GASS (Saintonge et al. 2011a,b, 2017), which obtained Hi and CO observations for 1,179 and 532 galaxies, respectively, at 0.01 < z < 0.05. The objects were selected from SDSS and are representative of the full galaxy population with M\\n\\\\* > 109 M⊙. The strength of these surveys comes from their sample size, the homogeneity of all the data products, and the depth of the observations. As is shown in Section 4, the latter is of particular importance as it makes it possible to infer the cold gas properties of even the most gas-poor subpopulations, via either spectral stacking or the setting of stringent upper limits. Other notable global cold gas surveys include RESOLVE (Stark et al. 2016), designed to be baryonic mass limited; HRS (Boselli et al. 2010), which includes 322 galaxies (225 of which have CO observations and 315 have Hi data from the literature) that span the full range of environments, from low-density regions to the core of the Virgo cluster; and ALLSMOG (Bothwell et al. 2014, Cicone et al. 2017), which observed CO(2–1) in 88 galaxies in the mass range of 108.5 < M\\n\\\\*/M⊙ < 1010, increasing the coverage of parameter space toward lower-mass galaxies.

Making the assumption (Bloom et al. 2007) that the required kick velocities are roughly the geometric mean between the minimum required velocity (v\\nkick,min=δR/τ∗) and the host velocity dispersion (v\\ndisp≈120 km s−1 for late-type hosts and ≈ 250 km s−1 for the more massive early-type hosts; Battaglia et al. 2005, Xue et al. 2008), the resulting projected kick velocities span v\\nkick∼20–140 km s−1 with a median value of about 60 km s−1 (Fong & Berger 2013). This range is consistent with the kick velocities derived for Galactic NS-NS binaries based on population synthesis models, v\\nkick≈5–500 km s−1 (Fryer & Kalogera 1997; Fryer, Burrows & Benz 1998; Wang, Lai & Han 2006; Wong, Willems & Kalogera 2010). It is important to note that the inferred distribution of kicks for short GRBs is consistent with some progenitors having negligible kicks, and it does not strictly require velocities that will unbind the progenitors from their hosts.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Measuring the SN rate in galaxy clusters as a function of redshift is probably the most direct way to recover the DTD. Optical spectroscopy and multiwavelength photometry of cluster galaxies has shown that most of their stars were formed within short episodes (∼100 Myr) at high redshift (z ∼ 3; Jimenez et al. 2007, Rettura et al. 2011), a good approximation to the δ-function burst defining the DTD. Thus, an almost-direct measurement of the DTD is provided by the observed SN Ia rate per unit stellar mass in galaxy clusters as a function of the time since the cluster's star-formation epoch (i.e., the cosmic epoch at the observed cluster redshift minus the stellar formation epoch). Cluster SN Ia rates have been measured over the past decade in the redshift range 0<z<1.5, corresponding to DTD delays of 2–10 Gyr (Gal-Yam, Maoz & Sharon 2002; Germany et al. 2004; Maoz & Gal-Yam 2004; Sharon et al. 2007; Gal-Yam et al. 2008; Graham et al. 2008; Mannucci et al. 2008; Dawson et al. 2009; Dilday et al. 2010a; Maoz, Sharon & Gal-Yam 2010; Barbary et al. 2012; Sand et al. 2008, 2012).

These clumps may sink toward the center and start forming the bulge (Bournaud et al. 2007, Dekel et al. 2009), or the gas may simply spiral toward the nucleus to grow the bulge in starbursts. During the initial stages, when the velocity dispersion of their groups is quite small, gas-rich mergers can also happen. Isolated spirals are able to sustain nearly constant star formation for a long time, possibly with the contribution of the so called cosmological fountain effect (Fraternali & Binney 2008, Fraternali 2014).

The drop in accretion rate at low redshift is caused in part by the expansion of the Universe as galaxies are driven away from each other by the repulsive force of dark energy; accretion and merging are slowed, and galaxies are gradually starved of incoming fuel.

       "  'text': 'Atmospheric retrieval refers to deriving the atmospheric properties of a planet from its observed spectrum. The canonical retrieval method comprises a parametric forward model of an exoplanetary atmosphere coupled with a parameter estimation algorithm to estimate the model parameters given a spectral data set. The free parameters in the model include the dominant chemical species with strong features in the observed spectral bandpass, the temperature profile, and the macroscopic cloud/haze parameters, e.g., the location in the atmosphere, spatial extent, and opacity, besides any other free parameters relevant to the spectrum at hand. The first retrieval codes came out a decade ago (Madhusudhan & Seager 2009, 2010); a number of codes are currently available in the field with applicability over the wide range of observations possible. A recent review of existing retrieval codes and capabilities in the field is available from Madhusudhan (2018). The latest developments in retrievals include incorporation of nonequilibrium phenomena at varying levels of complexity, such as different prescriptions for clouds/hazes (e.g., Line et al. 2016, Barstow et al. 2017, Lavie et al. 2017b, MacDonald & Madhusudhan 2017b), deviations from radiative–convective equilibrium (Gandhi & Madhusudhan 2017), and benchmarking with 3D circulation models (Blecic et al. 2017). State-of-the-art codes use a wide range of parameter estimation methods spanning Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (Blecic et al. 2017), optimal estimation gradient-descent algorithm (Barstow et al. 2017), and nested sampling algorithm (e.g., Benneke & Seager 2013). More recently, machine learning algorithms have been explored for atmospheric retrieval (e.g., Waldmann 2016). In recent years, state-of-the-art retrieval codes have allowed detailed constraints on the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, and properties of clouds/hazes in a number of exoplanets, both transiting and directly imaged (Madhusudhan 2018).',\n",

Calculations typically assume H dominates the mass, and a 36% mass correction for He is applied. Based on these relationships, \\n\\n estimates in the range of ∼0.1 up to above unity were derived on galactic and subgalactic scales (e.g., Genzel et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2012a,b; Davies et al. 2019; Förster Schreiber et al. 2019; Freeman et al. 2019; Swinbank et al. 2019).

       "  'text': 'Using gamma-ray observations, Grenier et al. (2005) found gas that was not seen in either Hi or CO emission. It is now considered to be mainly molecular (Murray et al. 2018a) and is known as the CO-poor or CO-dark molecular gas that was observed earlier in translucent clouds and explained by theoretical models (van Dishoeck & Black 1987, Lada & Blitz 1988, van Dishoeck 1990). The CO-dark layer is located at an A\\nV ∼ 1 in PDRs, where H2 self-shielding creates a layer of H2, whereas CO forms deeper into the cloud (van Dishoeck & Black 1988). Wolfire et al. (2010) constructed theoretical models of the surfaces of illuminated molecular clouds and found, for local Galactic conditions, a CO-dark mass fraction of ∼30%. Values of ∼30–50% are roughly consistent with Galactic observations from gamma-ray observations (Grenier et al. 2005), dust emission from the Planck Surveyor Satellite (Planck Collab. et al. 2011), extinction from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (Paradis et al. 2012), [Cii] line emission from Herschel (Pineda et al. 2013), and mass estimates from numerical simulations of galactic disks where the CO-dark gas is found in interarm filaments (e.g., Smith et al. 2014; see also Kalberla et al. 2020). There is also a significant CO-dark fraction in the diffuse gas discussed in Section 7.3. The [Cii] and [Ci] emission can in principle trace the CO-dark gas but must be calibrated because the [Cii] also arises in Hi gas, and [Ci] misses the C+–H2 regions. Models (e.g., Wolfire et al. 2010, Nordon & Sternberg 2016, Madden et al. 2020) predict the dark gas fraction should increase at lower metallicity because of reduced shielding of the CO, although Hu et al. (2021) suggest the effect of metallicity is not as large as in previous models. The trend is confirmed by observations in the Galactic disk, where the metallicity decreases by a factor of ∼2.6 between 4 kpc and 10 kpc while the CO-dark gas fraction increases by a factor of ∼4 (Pineda et al. 2013, Langer et al. 2014), and also by observations in low-metallicity galaxies (Section 8.4).',\n",

The depths of the 3.0-μm H2O and 4.67-μm CO bands (McFadzean et al. 1989, Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2005) and the 4.62-μm XCN feature (Moneti et al. 2001, Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2009) vary with factors of ∼4 between these sources. As much as 60–80% of the H2O ices may be local to the inner parsec of the Galaxy, possibly in dense clumps in the circumnuclear ring or mini-spiral (Chiar et al. 2002, Moultaka et al. 2005). The foreground contamination is less certain for CO ices (Moultaka et al. 2009), but in any case the total column relative to H2O is small (<10%). Although not much CO has frozen out, there is little evidence for thermal processing. The CO profile has a strong apolar component (Moneti et al. 2001, Moultaka et al. 2005), and the 15.2-μm CO2 bending mode, observed in the ISO beam of ∼20 arcsec encompassing a number of IRS sources, shows a lack of thermal processing as well (Gerakines et al. 1999). Other detected ice species include NH3 and CH4, whereas solid CH3OH is notably underabundant (<5%; Chiar et al. 2000, 2002). The detection of the stretch mode of NH3 at 2.96 μm in ISO and high spatial resolution ground-based observations, supported by the presence of NH3.H2O hydrates at 3.2–3.7 μm and by the 6.2-μm bend mode, is unusual and implies a large NH3 abundance of up to 30% relative to solid H2O. An N-rich environment is also reflected in a high OCN− abundance of 3% toward GC IRS 19 (Chiar et al. 2002; recalculated using the band strength by van Broekhuizen et al. 2005).',\n",

Nevertheless, it is certainly oversimplified to assume that all planetary systems have the same number of planets (e.g., Ballard & Johnson 2016, Mulders et al. 2018). Having a Poisson distribution for the intrinsic multiplicity (e.g., Lissauer et al. 2011, He et al. 2019, Sandford et al. 2019, Zink et al. 2019) is likely not justified either. The underlying assumption behind the Poisson distribution is that occurrences and properties of individual planets around the same host are independent from each other. Although it has not been proved invalid for Kepler planets, there is emerging evidence that the presence and properties of planets inside the same system may be correlated because of the shared formation environment and/or host properties (see Sections 1.1, 2.4, and 2.5). Furthermore, the exponential or power-law (i.e., Zipfian distribution; Sandford et al. 2019) forms can be securely ruled out. These distributions predict overly abundant intrinsic single-planet systems, which is not supported by TTV observations (e.g., Ford et al. 2011).',\n",

The idea is that the properties of the stochastic variations of an AGN light curve are driven by an accretion disk near the central supermassive black hole and that this variability provides an observational probe of the small scale astrophysical processes. The standard approach is to fit a GP model to the light curve—typically using a damped random walk kernel (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012), or the more general CARMA kernel (e.g., Kelly et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2022, Yu et al. 2022), because these permit efficient computations even with large data sets—and then to use the inferred hyperparameter values to constrain the variability amplitudes and timescales of the system (e.g., Kozłowski et al. 2010; MacLeod et al. 2010, 2012; Kelly et al. 2014; Kasliwal et al. 2017; Moreno et al. 2019; Stone et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2022; Yu et al. 2022).

These include analytic models (Ferrara et al. 2017, Popping et al. 2017b), SAMs (e.g., Granato et al. 2000), idealized galaxy evolution simulations (Safarzadeh et al. 2017), and cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy-formation simulations (Mancini et al. 2016, Cullen et al. 2017, Narayanan et al. 2018b). For the most part, there is consensus among the varied theoretical efforts. Granato et al. (2000) demonstrated the importance of decoupled sites of emission of UV and IR radiation via consideration of the impact of birth cloud clearing times on their simulations. Similarly, Narayanan et al. (2018b) explicitly calculated the UV optical depths for hydrodynamic simulations of galaxy evolution to arrive at a similar point, whereas Popping et al. (2017b) cast this result in the context of holes in obscuring dust screens, as well as the impact of increased turbulence in the obscuring ISM. In short, increasing optical depths move galaxies along the IRX–β relation (\\n\\nFigure 5\\n\\n) while increasingly decoupled star-dust geometries (i.e., a proxy for varying attenuation curves) displace galaxies vertically in IRX–β space. It is a point of consensus among theoretical models that the scatter in where star-forming galaxies present in IRX–β space is due to the diversity of underlying attenuation laws; this cause for the scatter has also been suggested in the interpretation of various observational data sets (e.g., Boquien et al. 2009, 2012; Mao et al. 2014; Álvarez-Márquez et al. 2019; Salim & Boquien 2019). What is unknown, however, is the root cause of the attenuation law variations. There is a degeneracy between variations in dust extinction curves (i.e., variations in grain sizes and/or the optical properties of grains) and the star-dust geometry in driving attenuation law variations. Both can impact the location of galaxies in the IRX–β space by modifying the attenuation curve.',\n",

       "  'text': 'In PDRs, the gas is primarily heated by photoelectrons ejected from the grains (Draine 1978). The PE heating is most efficient for the smallest sizes, particularly for the carriers of the UIBs (see, e.g., Weingartner & Draine 2001). This heating efficiency therefore depends on the dust properties and thus on the environment. Assuming that [Cii]\\n\\n is the main gas coolant, the PE efficiency, ϵPE, can be approximated by the gas-to-dust cooling ratio: ϵPE≃LCii\\n/L\\nTIR. Detailed studies usually add other lines to the gas cooling rate, such as [Oi]\\n\\n, to have a more complete estimate (see, e.g., Cormier et al. 2015). Overall, Smith et al. (2017) found that 0.1%≲ϵPE≲1%, with an average of 〈ϵPE〉≃0.5%, in a sample of 54 nearby galaxies. It appears that ϵPE is lower when the dust temperature is higher (Rubin et al. 2009, Croxall et al. 2012). This is not likely the result of the destruction of the UIB carriers, as their intensity correlates best with the [Cii]\\n\\n emission (see, e.g., Helou et al. 2001). It is conjectured, rather, to result from the saturation of grain charging in UV-bright regions. The shape of the ISRF also has consequences for the accuracy with which L\\nTIR represents the true UV PE-efficient flux. Indeed, Kapala et al. (2017) showed that the variations of ϵPE in M31 could be explained by the contribution of old stars to \\n\\n. Finally, one of the most puzzling features is that \\n\\n is higher at low metallicity (Poglitsch et al. 1995, Madden et al. 1997, Cormier et al. 2015, Smith et al. 2017), while the UIB strength drops in these systems (see Section 4.3.4). This is currently poorly understood. However, in the extreme case of I Zw 18 (Z≃1/35Z⊙), where no UIB is detected and the PE heating is estimated to be negligible, the gas-cooling-to-TIR ratio is still ≃1% (Lebouteiller et al. 2017).

Planets (see the sidebar What Is a Planet?)? Beginning with Adams et al.

In contrast, Boss (1997) argued that the direct collapse of clumps from GIs can create massive gas giant planets (see also Durisen et al. 2007, and references therein). More recently, a series of papers starting with Nayakshin (2010) have proposed that a combination of GI and tidal stripping can even produce rocky planets. Considering which disks are susceptible to GI and fragmentation reveals parameters unfavorable to the formation of planets but favorable to the formation of more massive wide-orbit companions. In Section 4, we have seen that unstable disks are massive, which leads to large initial masses for fragments; they are often undergoing rapid infall, which can enhance the subsequent growth rates; and they are experiencing rapid angular momentum transport, which can cause rapid migration and destruction of marginally bound objects (which are the most likely to be low in mass in the first place).

       "  'text': 'Thanks to its short distance, Orion KL can be studied in greater detail than Sgr B2, and many signs of chemical differentiation have been seen within this source. For example, resolved CARMA (Combined Array for Research in Millimeter-wave Astronomy) observations showed that cyanides peak at different locations from other species such as CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Friedel & Snyder 2008). A differentiation between N-bearing COMs (cyanides and NH2CHO) and O-bearing COMs (alcohols, CH3OCH3, and CH3OCHO) has also been inferred from differences in their excitation temperatures from Herschel observations by Crockett et al. (2015), who found that the former trace hotter gas (200–300 K) than the latter (100–150 K). However, the CH3C(O)CH3 emission detected with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI) resembles more the cyanide emission than that of CH3OCH3 and CH3OCHO (Peng et al. 2013, Feng et al. 2015), two COMs that were found to be strongly spatially correlated (Brouillet et al. 2013). To complicate the situation even further, Favre et al. (2017) demonstrated with ALMA that CH3COOH and (CH2OH)2 trace a more compact region located closer to the hot core than other O-bearing COMs. Analyzing a larger sample of O-bearing COMs detected with ALMA, Tercero et al. (2018) confirmed this result and showed that there is in fact a more general spatial segregation between the COMs containing a C-O-C structure and the COMs containing a C-OH bond, the former tracing the compact ridge and the latter the hot core. Tercero et al. (2018) interpret this segregation as resulting from the chemistry being dominated by different radicals in these two regions, methoxy (CH3O·) in the former and hydroxymethyl (·CH2OH) in the latter. One caveat in these discussions is that integrated intensity maps intended to trace a particular transition of a given COM may be contaminated by emission from other species due to the complex velocity structure of the Orion KL region (Pagani et al. 2017). A more reliable method would be to construct column density maps from LTE fits of the spectrum of each pixel (e.g., using the VINE method; Calcutt et al. 2018b).',\n",

       "  'text': 'The various observational studies published on Hi supershells throughout the late 1990s and 2000s made it clear that the role of supershells is to order the diffuse Hi into large-scale, filamentary structures visible throughout the Galactic Plane. Does the Hi also cool within these structures? Simulations have shown that supershells sweep up the warm, ambient medium into dense, structured filamentary walls where the gas can cool to form CNM and molecular clumps (Koyama & Inutsuka 2000, Mac Low et al. 2005, Hopkins et al. 2012). From an observational perspective, this role is less well documented, although there have certainly been examples of supershells with associated molecular gas (e.g., Fukui et al. 1999, Dawson et al. 2008). McClure-Griffiths et al. (2003) found clumps of narrow-linewidth Hi in the walls of a large supershell, suggesting that the structures were formed by Rayleigh–Taylor instabilities. Both Knee & Brunt (2001) and Moss et al. (2013) used HISA to show that the walls of two supershell structures were dominated by cold gas. The most comprehensive analysis of supershells as collectors and coolers of gas was produced by Dawson et al. (2011), who showed that within two supershells the walls were dominated by cold gas with estimated temperatures and densities of T\\nk ∼ 100 K and n\\nH ∼ 10 cm−3. Comparing the walls with the surrounding medium, they found statistically significant indicators of narrow linewidths consistent with enhanced CNM fraction as well as molecular fraction.',\n",

       "  'text': \"Spatially resolving MBHBs at subparsec separations is difficult. The most compact, directly imaged MBHB on record is the dual AGNs in the radio galaxy 0402+379, with a projected separation of 7.3 pc (Rodriguez et al. 2006). For more compact sources, photometric and spectroscopic techniques can be used to infer the presence of MBHBs. Circumbinary accretion may prove crucial for upcoming multimessenger efforts to identify such compact MBHBs in the form of periodically varying electromagnetic (EM) counterparts (e.g., Bogdanović et al. 2022, Charisi et al. 2022). The sought-after periodic signals in time-variable AGNs include (a) time-variable kinematic offsets of the broad emission lines (Gaskell 1996), (b) Doppler-boosted broad-band emission from the circumsecondary accretion disk (D'Orazio et al. 2015), (c) periodic self-lensing flares (D'Orazio & Di Stefano 2018, Hu et al. 2020), and (d) broadband photometric variability due to pulsed/modulated accretion (e.g., Tang et al. 2018). In practice, the kinematics approach is of limited use at subparsec because of the confusion and truncation of the distinct broad-line regions at these separations (Kelley 2021), making the photometric approach a more viable and data-rich technique (e.g., Charisi et al. 2022). Indeed, systematic searches for periodic signals in the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (Graham et al. 2015), the Palomar Transient Factory (Charisi et al. 2016), and the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Liu et al. 2019b) have revealed hundreds of MBHB candidates. Measuring photometric variability is not exempt from systematic uncertainties (Graham et al. 2015, Liu et al. 2016, Witt et al. 2022) but has the potential of being a powerful multimessenger tool in combination with simultaneous GW detections (Charisi et al. 2022). At subparsec separations, MBHBs emit GWs in the frequencies suitable for PTAs, which are forecast to provide individual binary detections within the next decade (Mingarelli et al. 2017, Kelley et al. 2018). In this regime, the binary orbit is still essentially Newtonian, and the associated GW waveforms are well understood. Likewise, the known photometric variability mechanisms (accretion/boosting/lensing) are all modulated on timescales commensurate with the binary orbit. Simultaneous GW/photometric detection of these objects would not only conclusively prove their existence but also allow for constraints on the their orbital parameters.\",\n",

This expansion is accompanied by the onset of mass loss, which is variously modeled as an impulsive shell ejection (e.g., Shore 2014, Mason et al. 2018), a continuous wind (Kato & Hachisu 1994), or a combination of the two (e.g., Friedjung 1987). As the nova transitions through optical maximum, most spectral lines show P Cygni profiles [e.g., \\n\\nFigure 4b\\n\\n\\n, subpanel i; see also the sidebar titled Transient Heavy-Element Absorption (THEA) Features]. With time, the emission component strengthens and the absorption weakens, which is consistent with a receding photosphere. Around maximum, the ejecta are dense enough to rapidly recombine, and the Str\\n\\nmgren sphere powered by the nuclear-burning WD is ionization bounded, such that the outer ejecta are neutral (Beck et al. 1990, Williams 1990). The dominant form of opacity is line blanketing by nearly neutral metals (sometimes called the iron curtain, because most of the opacity is from Fe lines; Shore & Aufdenberg 1993, Shore et al. 1994). Modeling of spectra before and around maximum finds that the density profiles of nova ejecta require a sharp outer profile (ρ ∝ r\\n−n\\n with n ≈ 15 for the outermost ejecta; Hauschildt et al. 1994) and a much shallower profile for the inner ejecta (n ≈ 3; Hauschildt et al. 1992). This density profile implies that the optical photospheric radius can vary by over a factor of ∼100 with wavelength and thereby sample a range of temperatures and ionization states (Hauschildt et al. 1995); it is therefore often called a pseudophotosphere.\\n',\n",

The star-formation efficiency (SFE) can be used to distinguish enhanced SF due to increased gas density from an enhancement of the SFR relative to density: Studies of the SFE of disks suggest it does not vary much from arm to interarm (Foyle et al. 2010), although Yu et al. (2021) demonstrate a correlation of SFE (or gas depletion timescales) with spiral arm strength in a large sample.',\n",

       "  'text': \"As for the comparison of the spatial distribution between dust and gas, several different configurations emerge. The asymmetric CO disks around β Pic and Fomalhaut both exhibit gas that closely traces the location of dust continuum emission in the system, enhancing the evidence for a common second-generation origin. The edge-on β Pic disk exhibits a weak asymmetry in dust continuum emission between the northeast and southwest disk limbs that is exaggerated in CO (Dent et al. 2014), whereas the location of the CO gas in Fomalhaut's eccentric dust ring corresponds at least approximately with the location of pericenter (Matrà et al. 2017b); however, the dust emission otherwise demonstrates no deviations from axisymmetry (MacGregor et al. 2017). Among the systems with generally axisymmetric gas disks, most that have been imaged at sufficiently high resolution seem to exhibit marked differences between the radial extent of the gas and dust emission (HD 21997, HD 141569, 49 Cet, \\n\\n Crv; Kóspál et al. 2013, White et al. 2016, Hughes et al. 2017, Marshall et al. 2017), although at least one—the only F star—exhibits cospatial gas and dust (HD 181327; Marino et al. 2016). Due to the coarse angular resolution of the survey by Lieman-Sifry et al. (2016), it is not yet clear how the extent of the gas and dust disks (i.e., HD 110058, HD 131835, HD 138813, HD 146897, HD 156623) in the sample compare. The overall picture that emerges is therefore one in which asymmetric gas disks are observed to closely trace the parent dust distributions, as expected for a common second-generation origin, whereas the relationship between gas and dust in the systems with symmetric (and, typically, extended) gas disks is more ambiguous.\",\n",

By combining their rotationally split p modes with a high-precision spectroscopic measurement of \\n\\n and stellar models or with the frequency of rotational modulation detected in the Kepler data, Benomar et al. (2015) and Nielsen et al. (2017) achieved the envelope and surface rotation rates of 27 such single stars, covering a mass range from 1.0 to 1.6 M⊙. This revealed nearly uniform radial envelope rotation with average rotation values covering \\n\\nHz for the sample, in agreement with the spectroscopic \\n\\n values. By contrast, Benomar et al. (2018) studied latitudinal differential rotation in 40 low-mass main-sequence stars in this mass range and found 13 of these to reveal significantly slower polar than equatorial rotation, a phenomenon that also occurs for the Sun (Thompson et al. 2003). Asteroseismic inversions to derive the latitudinal rotation law in the envelope, \\n\\n, revealed the magnitude of the angular differentiality to be larger than that for the Sun, with latitudinal shear factors between the equator and at midlatitude ranging from −1.4 to −0.27 (Benomar et al. 2018, their table S3). Such a level of observed latitudinal shear is much larger than predictions from theory and numerical simulations for the Sun and solar-like stars (Hotta et al. 2015, Brun et al. 2017). Although the 13 stars have faster average envelope rotation than the Sun, with \\n\\nHz when adopting a latitudinal rotation law as for the Sun, the asteroseismic inference of these shear values points to large anisotropy in the turbulence, accompanied by efficient angular momentum transport. These asteroseismic results remain unexplained so far. Such a level of shear is not found from the 3D numerical simulations for red giants by Brun & Palacios (2009), who derived antisolar latitudinal differential rotation and strong radial differential rotation in the slowly rotating outer envelope, as it would occur from conservation of specific angular momentum by individual convective flows. Major theoretical uncertainty in the level of radial differentiality of the rotation in convection zones remains for low-mass red giants (e.g., Kissin & Thompson 2015).',\n",

       "  'text': \"The dynamical measurements from AO images allowed the derivation of the mass of the central object with a few percent accuracy. The motion of the stars follow almost perfect Keplerian orbits, even for stars like S2 that passes the central source as close as \\n\\n (Schwarzschild radius: R\\nS = 2GM/c\\n2). Following the pericenter passage of S2 in 2002, it became clear that the first-order general relativity (GR) effects will come in reach with precision observations (Rubilar & Eckart 2001). Despite the fact that a black hole is a genuine prediction of GR, the signatures of GR on the stellar orbits with the leading post-Newtonian terms (O(β2), β = v/c), namely gravitational redshift and Schwarzschild precession, are small perturbations w.r.t. the Keplerian motion (for a review, see Alexander 2005). The gravitational redshift scales with β2 ≈ R\\nS/R. In case of S2, the effect is approximately \\n\\n compared to the maximum velocity of \\n\\n at pericenter passage. The Schwarzschild precession rotates the elliptical orbit by ≈12.1 arcmin per 16 years revolution. In order to measure the effects, a significant improvement (by a factor of 4–10) in astrometry compared to what was possible in 2010 was needed. This posed one of the main science drivers for the development of the GRAVITY instrument (Eisenhauer et al. 2008, Paumard et al. 2008). Since its first light (GRAVITY Collab. et al. 2017a), GRAVITY has been regularly observing the central S-stars and SgrA\\\\*. On May 19, 2018, S2 passed pericenter with 2.6% of the speed of light. By simultaneously monitoring the star's radial velocity and motion on the sky, GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2018a) were able to detect the gravitational redshift and transverse Doppler effect at high significance (later confirmed by Do et al. 2019). The statistical robustness of the redshift detection was further improved by GRAVITY Collab. et al. (2019a) to more than 20σ significance. Amorim et al. (2019) used two atomic transition lines in the spectrum of S2 to test one pillar of the Einstein equivalence principle and, thus, GR and the local position invariance (LPI). By separately measuring the redshift of the hydrogen and helium lines in the stellar spectrum, effectively two independent clocks can be probed, while moving through the black hole's gravitational potential. The results set an upper limit on a violation of the LPI of 5 × 10−2 for a change of potential that is six magnitudes larger than accessible with terrestrial experiments.\",\n",

Subsequent observational work confirmed that this is the dominant impact of intrinsic alignments on weak lensing measurements; but it cannot be eliminated by removing galaxy pairs at the same redshift from the lensing sample. Based on recent observations (e.g., Singh & Mandelbaum 2016), intrinsic alignments will be an important systematic that surveys like LSST must mitigate (\\nFigure 7\\n). Efforts to remove this systematic typically include modeling or self-calibration in a joint cosmological analysis of galaxy–galaxy, galaxy–shear, and shear–shear correlations (DES Collab. et al. 2017, Joudaki et al. 2018, Yao et al. 2017).

All these signatures fundamentally depend on the lifetime of the NS remnant, with bluer, more massive, and more energetic kilonovae without a successful jet pointing to longer-lived NSs. Although EM observations of GW170817 offer no conclusive evidence, and a long-lived or stable NS cannot be entirely ruled out on EM and GW grounds (e.g., Abbott et al. 2017b, 2020b; Piro et al. 2019; Troja et al. 2020), the presence of a blue kilonova component associated with a large mass of lanthanide-free ejecta and \\n\\n (Section 4), together with a successful relativistic jet (Section 5), strongly disfavors a prompt collapse to a BH and argues in favor of an HMNS that collapsed to a BH within a second or so after merger (Granot et al. 2017, Margalit & Metzger 2017, Shibata et al. 2017, Metzger et al. 2018, Rezzolla et al. 2018, Gill et al. 2019b, Ciolfi 2020, Murguia-Berthier et al. 2021).

This observable has the potential to yield vastly more information about reionization than any other probe (and, with additional effort, the ages that preceded reionization; Furlanetto et al. 2006, Morales & Wyithe 2010, Pritchard & Loeb 2012). Although in principle the 21-cm signal provides a tomographic image of reionization like that shown in \\nFigure 11\\n, the first generations of instruments do not have the sensitivity to make images, and we must hope instead to achieve statistical detections of the signal (McQuinn et al. 2006, although see Zaroubi et al. 2012). There is a worldwide effort to detect the z∼6–10 21-cm signal using both specialized and multipurpose interferometers, such as the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India, the Mileura Widefield Array (MWA) in Australia, the Precision Array to Probe Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa, the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) primarily in the Netherlands, and the 21-cm Array in China (with planning underway for the next-generation Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) instrument and the Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-low in South Africa and Australia, respectively; Paciga et al. 2013, van Haarlem et al. 2013, DeBoer et al. 2014, Ali et al. 2015, Dillon et al. 2015, Koopmans et al. 2015).

There are also efforts afoot attempting to detect the sky-averaged (or global) 21-cm signal from z=6–30 (Bowman & Rogers 2010, Burns et al. 2012, Bernardi et al. 2015).

In general, the SFMS has a scatter of ∼0.2–0.3 dex in SFR at any redshift, with a slope slightly smaller than one at low redshift, ∼0.8 dex/log(M\\n\\\\*). The SFMS presents a clear evolution in the zero point that increases with redshift (e.g., Speagle et al. 2014, Rodríguez-Puebla et al. 2016). By contrast, RGs are distributed well below the SFMS, following a loose relation with the M\\n\\\\* (or a cloud), broadly corresponding to the location expected for an EW(Hα) ∼ 1 Å (e.g., Stasińska et al. 2008). In between the two groups, there is an area with a much lower number density of galaxies, known as the green valley (GV). Galaxies in the GV (or GVGs) are considered in transit between SFGs and RGs, and their limited number has been interpreted as a consequence of a fast process transforming the former to the latter (e.g., Bell et al. 2004, Faber et al. 2007, Schiminovich et al. 2007). More recently, AGN hosts were found located in the GV of the SFR–M\\n\\\\* diagram (e.g., Torres-Papaqui et al. 2012, Schawinski et al. 2014, Cano-Díaz et al. 2016, Sánchez et al. 2018), as shown in \\nFigure 2\\n. Actually, their distribution is spread from the SFMS toward the RGs cloud, covering mostly the GV, and sharing many properties with GVGs (e.g., Sánchez et al. 2018). This result suggests that there is a connection (or coevolution) between the AGN activity and the quenching of SF in galaxies.',\n",

       "  'text': 'In \\nFigure 4b\\n\\n, we present a compilation of ξion estimates drawn from the literature. Wherever possible we have shown average measurements based on large samples of objects, and we quote the ξion,0 as calibrated by the original authors. Where no data for f\\nesc were provided, we assume f\\nesc = 0 (a number of authors themselves assume this). Measurements of this quantity have, perhaps naturally, been concentrated on the most highly ionizing and highly luminous objects at a given redshift—indeed those taken in the very distant Universe are only possible for extremely powerful emission line galaxies. They have also been obtained for samples obtained through a variety of selection methods, which produce overlapping samples. For clarity, in \\nFigure 4b\\n\\n we attempt to classify the samples into four broad categories. The designated “High EW” symbols show reported sample means for galaxies selected as very luminous examples of narrowband or spectroscopically selected emission line galaxies (typically Hα emitters at cosmic noon and Lyα emitters at high redshift) (Stark et al. 2017; Matthee et al. 2018, 2021; De Barros et al. 2019; Maseda et al. 2020). “EELGs” symbols indicate galaxies selected as extreme emission line galaxies either on the basis of broadband photometry excesses or directly through spectroscopy (EELGs) (Schaerer et al. 2016; Berg et al. 2018, 2019; Chisholm et al. 2019; Onodera et al. 2020). “LyC or high [Oiii]/[Oii]” symbols show samples of galaxies identified as Lyman continuum leakers (i.e., with a measured high f\\nesc) or as having very high [Oiii]/[Oii] ratios (Schaerer et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2019, 2021; Guseva et al. 2020). Other star-forming galaxy samples, including both Lyman break galaxies and typical Lyα emitters are shown by “SFGs” symbols (Shim et al. 2011, Bouwens et al. 2016, Mármol-Queraltó et al. 2016, Harikane et al. 2018, Shivaei et al. 2018, Faisst et al. 2019, Lam et al. 2019, Emami et al. 2020, Naidu et al. 2020, Nanayakkara et al. 2020, Endsley et al. 2021). To illustrate the scatter within samples, we also shown individual galaxy measurements for an EELG sample (Chisholm et al. 2019) at z ∼ 1.6–3, Lyman continuum leakers (Schaerer et al. 2018) at z ∼ 0.3, high [Oiii]/[Oii] galaxies (Nakajima et al. 2016) at z ∼ 3, and emission line galaxy samples at z > 6.5 (Endsley et al. 2021) and z ∼ 3.1–3.6 (Onodera et al. 2020).

The bulk density of Patroclus and Hector, both Jupiter's Trojans, was determined to be ρ=0.8–1 g cm−3 (Marchis et al. 2014, Buie et al. 2015), which is suggestive of high H2O-ice content and/or high porosity. The Patroclus and (18974) 1998 WR21 equal-size binaries are probably rare survivors of a much larger population of binaries in the outer disk (most binaries were presumably dissociated by collisions and planetary encounters).

       "  'text': 'The response to the tilt of thinner disks is qualitatively different than it is to that of thick disks. In fact, when the disk thickness is smaller than the disk viscosity parameter, h/r < α, warps propagate in the disks viscously. Bardeen & Petterson (1975) predicted that this would lead to the inner parts of the accretion disk aligning with the black hole midplane and separating from the outer, misaligned part of the disk by a smooth warp (the Bardeen–Petterson effect or BP). However, at the time it was impossible to take into account the magnetized turbulence responsible for the accretion. And, though such alignment was seen in nonrelativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations (e.g., Nelson & Papaloizou 2000), general relativistic magnetized simulations of tilted disks, as thin as h/r = 0.08, have shown no sign of the BP alignment (Zhuravlev et al. 2014). Liska et al. (2019c) simulated the thinnest disk, with h/r = 0.03, tilted by 10 degrees relative to a rapidly spinning black hole, and found that the inner regions of the disk, r\\n\\n\\n 5r\\ng, aligned with the black hole. This remarkable discovery is the first demonstration of BP alignment in a general relativistic numerical simulation of a magnetized accretion disk. Importantly, the duration of these simulations is long enough for the inner regions of the accretion disk to achieve inflow equilibrium and quasi–steady state. The BP alignment was also seen in shorter nonrelativistic simulations that approximated the effects of black hole rotation via additional torques in MHD equations (Hawley & Krolik 2019) and did not include the effects of apsidal precession, which can qualitatively affect the alignment process (Nealon et al. 2016).',\n",

       "  'text': 'Solar-like oscillations, which are excited and damped in the outer convective envelopes of a star, are seen in stars like the Sun and red giants. With the advent of space-based missions like Kepler and CoRoT that provide high-quality photometric data over a long time series, it has now become feasible to detect solar-like oscillations in tens of thousands of stars (Stello et al. 2013, 2015). Typically, the power spectrum of a star with solar-like oscillations (\\nFigure 10) shows a regular pattern of modes, characterized by a large frequency separation Δν. The overall amplitude is modulated by a Gaussian envelope, and this is characterized by the frequency of maximum oscillation νmax. Theory suggests that Δν for a given star is related to its density (Ulrich 1986), whereas the νmax is related to its surface gravity and temperature (Brown et al. 1991, Kjeldsen & Bedding 1995). Using the above two relations, the mass and the radius of a star can be constrained. The mass of a red giant is sensitive to its age, and this makes asteroseismology very useful for understanding Galactic evolution (Chaplin et al. 2011, Sharma et al. 2016). For further details on solar-type oscillations see the review by Chaplin & Miglio (2013).\\n',\n",

Existing observations have sometimes pointed to an affirmative answer (Cuntz et al. 2007, Bello González et al. 2010) and sometimes to a negative answer (Carlsson et al. 2007, Beck et al. 2012). Numerical simulations can reproduce much of the observed structure and time-dependent dynamics in the nonmagnetic chromosphere (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). However, many simulations tend to produce a highly intermittent state, i.e., hot shocks surrounded by larger regions that may be too dark and cool to produce the steady emission seen in many chromospheric spectral lines (Kalkofen 2012). No matter the role of acoustic waves/shocks in the chromospheric energy budget, their dissipation tends not to leave much power available at larger heights to heat the corona (Athay & White 1978, Cranmer et al. 2007). Thus, in recent years the focus has shifted heavily to magnetic fields and MHD fluctuations as a primary heating mechanism for both the chromosphere (Jess et al. 2015) and corona (Section 5.3).',\n",

       "  'text': \"\\nAbbot et al. (2012) discussed how a carbonate-silicate cycle could be maintained with up to 95% of a planet's surface covered by water, suggesting by extrapolation a possible CO2 cycling for Type 2 waterworlds via the rocky ocean floor. Such planet models show a varying timescale for a carbon cycle, depending on their initial carbon inventory and temperature (Foley 2015). However, for Type 1 waterworlds, that is, super-Earths with water mass fractions like those of Earth or higher, the deep oceans are separated from the rocky interior via a layer of high-pressure ices. Therefore, an alternative mechanism to modulate abundant gases like CO2 and CH4 would be required in waterworlds. Such a mechanism would depend on the properties of their clathration in water over a range of very high pressures. Under very high pressures (above 0.6 GPa), common to super-Earth-sized water planets, clathrates undergo a phase transition in their structure to a form known as filled ice that can transport CH4 and CO2 (Levi et al. 2013, 2017). This should enable effective cycling of CO2 through the atmosphere and oceans on water planets residing in the HZ (e.g., with water oceans at the surface) and thus provide an alternative atmospheric concentration feedback mechanism to regulate CO2 on water planets. The timescales and effectiveness of such cycling is still an open question (Kitzmann et al. 2015, Levi et al. 2017). A lively debate in the literature addresses how the interiors of such worlds might work, regarding the ability to cycle gases from the rocky core to the atmosphere (Valencia et al. 2007; Grasset et al. 2009; Fu et al. 2010; Rogers & Seager 2010; Kaltenegger et al. 2013; Tackley et al. 2013; Levi et al. 2013, 2017) and whether such planets could be habitats (Abbot 2016, Abbot et al. 2012, Kaltenegger et al. 2013, Noack et al. 2016). First analyses of what atmospheric spectra of waterworlds might look like and whether they could be distinguished from land-dominated worlds even in transit, where surface albedo would not be detectable, depend strongly on whether long-term CO2 cycling can be maintained (Kaltenegger et al. 2013).\",\n",

       "  'text': \"Assuming the monomers are present, the full kinetic models of Boulangier et al. (2019) favor Al2O3 as the primary dust precursor candidate owing to the high temperature at which nucleation can occur (∼1,800 K). However, if one starts from an atomic mixture, an acute problem arises because the concentration of the Al2O3 monomer is almost negligible in the relevant temperature range, and most of the aluminum is in the atomic form. These results suggest that among the possible candidates, TiO2 clusters are the only possible dust precursors. However, the kinetic temperature corresponding to the spatial regions where dust is found is roughly 1,500–2,000 K (Norris et al. 2012, Khouri et al. 2016), well above the formation temperature of (TiO2)\\nN\\n = 10, which is around 1,000–1,200 K. Furthermore, a significantly larger fraction of presolar grains of AGB origin contain Al2O3 rather than TiO2 grains (Choi et al. 1998, Stroud et al. 2004, Bose et al. 2010), although the expected smaller size of TiO2 grains makes them more difficult to detect. So, alternative routes are now being explored to determine whether larger (Al2O3)\\nn\\n clusters can form bypassing the monomer, and using, for example, the (Al2O3)2 dimer as the main building block, where the dimer is formed from oxidation reactions of the abundant Al2O2 molecule with AlO, AlOH, OH, and H2O (D. Gobrecht, J. Plane, and L. Decin, in preparation). Another possibility might be that large clusters can exist at higher kinetic temperatures than currently suggested by the model calculations, because of thermo-ionic electron emission (Demyk et al. 2004), or possibly radiative cooling (potentially via recurrent fluorescence or vibrational radiative cooling) rather than dissociating. The Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman (1959) famously used as the title of his talk presented to the American Physical Society in Pasadena on December 29, 1959, There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom.
