      "The bright radio source S5 0716+714, which is usually classified as a BL Lac object, is one of the most intensively studied blazar. S5 0716+714 demonstrates extremely peculiar properties, such as the shortest time-scale of optical and polarimetric variations observed in blazars. In this paper, we present the results of a 9-h polarimetric monitoring of S5 0716+714 with a ∼70-s resolution carried out using the 6-m telescope BTA of the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences (SAO RAS). An anaysis of the observations reveals variability in both the total and the polarized light on a time-scale of 1-1.5 hr. Because polarization is generated by plasma motion in the magnetic field, the variations of the polarization vector are bound to the magnetic field configuration and the average time-scales specify the size of the emitting region, which cannot be resolved directly. We present a numerically processed model of the polarization in the jet with a precessing helical magnetic field. Fitting the model reveals that the observed short-term variations, with a complicated trajectory of polarization vector, could be induced by a magnetic field precession with a period T ≈ 15 d.\n"

       " (\"['Analyzing interferometric observations of strong gravitational lenses with recurrent and convolutional neural networks']\\n\\nWe use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to estimate the parameters of strong gravitational lenses from interferometric observations. We explore multiple strategies and find that the best results are obtained when the effects of the dirty beam are first removed from the images with a deconvolution performed with an RNN-based structure before estimating the parameters. For this purpose, we use the recurrent inference machine (RIM) introduced in Putzky &amp; Welling (2017). This provides a fast and automated alternative to the traditional CLEAN algorithm. We obtain the uncertainties of the estimated parameters using variational inference with Bernoulli distributions. We test the performance of the networks with a simulated test dataset as well as with five ALMA observations of strong lenses. For the observed ALMA data we compare our estimates with values obtained from a maximum-likelihood lens modeling method which operates in the visibility space and find consistent results. We show that we can estimate the lensing parameters with high accuracy using a combination of an RNN structure performing image deconvolution and a CNN performing lensing analysis, with uncertainties less than a factor of two higher than those achieved with maximum-likelihood methods. Including the deconvolution procedure performed by RIM, a single evaluation can be done in about a second on a single GPU, providing a more than six orders of magnitude increase in analysis speed while using about eight orders of magnitude less computational resources compared to maximum-likelihood lens modeling in the uv-plane. We conclude that this is a promising method for the analysis of mm and cm interferometric data from current facilities (e.g., ALMA, JVLA) and future large interferometric observatories (e.g., SKA), where an analysis in the uv-plane could be difficult or unfeasible.\",\n",

Future large-scale surveys with high-resolution imaging will provide us with approximately 10<SUP>5</SUP> new strong galaxy-scale lenses. These strong-lensing systems will be contained in large data amounts, however, which are beyond the capacity of human experts to visually classify in an unbiased way. Aim. We present a new strong gravitational lens finder based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The method was applied to the strong-lensing challenge organized by the Bologna Lens Factory. It achieved first and third place, respectively, on the space-based data set and the ground-based data set. The goal was to find a fully automated lens finder for ground-based and space-based surveys that minimizes human inspection. <BR /> Methods: We compared the results of our CNN architecture and three new variations (\"invariant\" \"views\" and \"residual\") on the simulated data of the challenge. Each method was trained separately five times on 17 000 simulated images, cross-validated using 3000 images, and then applied to a test set with 100 000 images. We used two different metrics for evaluation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score, and the recall with no false positive (Recall<SUB>0FP</SUB>). <BR /> Results: For ground-based data, our best method achieved an AUC score of 0.977 and a Recall<SUB>0FP</SUB> of 0.50. For space-based data, our best method achieved an AUC score of 0.940 and a Recall<SUB>0FP</SUB> of 0.32. Adding dihedral invariance to the CNN architecture diminished the overall score on space-based data, but achieved a higher no-contamination recall. We found that using committees of five CNNs produced the best recall at zero contamination and consistently scored better AUC than a single CNN. <BR /> Conclusions: We found that for every variation of our CNN lensfinder, we achieved AUC scores close to 1 within 6%. A deeper network did not outperform simpler CNN models either. This indicates that more complex networks are not needed to model the simulated lenses. To verify this, more realistic lens simulations with more lens-like structures (spiral galaxies or ring galaxies) are needed to compare the performance of deeper and shallower networks.',\n",

       " (\"['The use of convolutional neural networks for modelling large optically-selected strong galaxy-lens samples']\\n\\nWe explore the effectiveness of deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for estimating strong gravitational lens mass model parameters. We have investigated a number of practicalities faced when modelling real image data, such as how network performance depends on the inclusion of lens galaxy light, the addition of colour information, and varying signal-to-noise. Our CNN was trained and tested with strong galaxy-galaxy lens images simulated to match the imaging characteristics of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) and Euclid. For images including lens galaxy light, the CNN can recover the lens model parameters with an acceptable accuracy, although a 34 per cent average improvement in accuracy is obtained when lens light is removed. However, the inclusion of colour information can largely compensate for the drop in accuracy resulting from the presence of lens light. While our findings show similar accuracies for single epoch Euclid VIS and LSST r-band data sets, we find a 24 per cent increase in accuracy by adding g- and i-band images to the LSST r-band without lens light and a 20 per cent increase with lens light. The best network performance is obtained when it is trained and tested on images where lens light exactly follows the mass, but when orientation and ellipticity of the light are allowed to differ from those of the mass, the network performs most consistently when trained with a moderate amount of scatter in the difference between the mass and light profiles.\",\n",

For this to happen, images of billions of galaxies will have to be inspected to identify potential candidates. In this context, deep-learning techniques are particularly suitable for finding patterns in large data sets, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in particular can efficiently process large volumes of images. We assess and compare the performance of three network architectures in the classification of strong-lensing systems on the basis of their morphological characteristics. In particular, we implemented a classical CNN architecture, an inception network, and a residual network. We trained and tested our networks on different subsamples of a data set of 40 000 mock images whose characteristics were similar to those expected in the wide survey planned with the ESA mission Euclid, gradually including larger fractions of faint lenses. We also evaluated the importance of adding information about the color difference between the lens and source galaxies by repeating the same training on single- and multiband images. Our models find samples of clear lenses with ≳90% precision and completeness. Nevertheless, when lenses with fainter arcs are included in the training set, the performance of the three models deteriorates with accuracy values of ~0.87 to ~0.75, depending on the model. Specifically, the classical CNN and the inception network perform similarly in most of our tests, while the residual network generally produces worse results. Our analysis focuses on the application of CNNs to high-resolution space-like images, such as those that the Euclid telescope will deliver. Moreover, we investigated the optimal training strategy for this specific survey to fully exploit the scientific potential of the upcoming observations. We suggest that training the networks separately on lenses with different morphology might be needed to identify the faint arcs. We also tested the relevance of the color information for the detection of these systems, and we find that it does not yield a significant improvement. The accuracy ranges from ~0.89 to ~0.78 for the different models. The reason might be that the resolution of the Euclid telescope in the infrared bands is lower than that of the images in the visual band.\",\n",

Neural network inference of strong-lens parameters and uncertainties from ground-based images\\']\\n\\nModeling of strong gravitational lenses is a necessity for further applications in astrophysics and cosmology. With the large number of detections in current and upcoming surveys, such as the Rubin Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), it is pertinent to investigate automated and fast analysis techniques beyond the traditional and time-consuming Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling methods. Building upon our (simple) convolutional neural network (CNN), we present here another CNN, specifically a residual neural network (ResNet), that predicts the five mass parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) profile (lens center x and y, ellipticity e<SUB>x</SUB> and e<SUB>y</SUB>, Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB>) and the external shear (γ<SUB>ext, 1</SUB>, γ<SUB>ext, 2</SUB>) from ground-based imaging data. In contrast to our previous CNN, this ResNet further predicts the 1σ uncertainty for each parameter. To train our network, we use our improved pipeline to simulate lens images using real images of galaxies from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey (HSC) and from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field as lens galaxies and background sources, respectively. We find very good recoveries overall for the SIE parameters, especially for the lens center in comparison to our previous CNN, while significant differences remain in predicting the external shear. From our multiple tests, it appears that most likely the low ground-based image resolution is the limiting factor in predicting the external shear. Given the run time of milli-seconds per system, our network is perfectly suited to quickly predict the next appearing image and time delays of lensed transients. Therefore, we use the network-predicted mass model to estimate these quantities and compare to those values obtained from our simulations. Unfortunately, the achieved precision allows only a first-order estimate of time delays on real lens systems and requires further refinement through follow-up modeling. Nonetheless, our ResNet is able to predict the SIE and shear parameter values in fractions of a second on a single CPU, meaning that we are able to efficiently process the huge amount of galaxy-scale lenses expected in the near future. <P />The network code is available under <A href=\"https://github.com/shsuyu/HOLISMOKES-public/tree/main/HOLISMOKES_IX\">https://github.com/shsuyu/HOLISMOKES-public/tree/main/HOLISMOKES_IX</A>',\n",

Efficient mass modeling of strong lenses through deep learning']\\n\\nModeling the mass distributions of strong gravitational lenses is often necessary in order to use them as astrophysical and cosmological probes. With the large number of lens systems (≳10<SUP>5</SUP>) expected from upcoming surveys, it is timely to explore efficient modeling approaches beyond traditional Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques that are time consuming. We train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on images of galaxy-scale lens systems to predict the five parameters of the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model (lens center x and y, complex ellipticity e<SUB>x</SUB> and e<SUB>y</SUB>, and Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB>). To train the network we simulate images based on real observations from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey for the lens galaxies and from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field as lensed galaxies. We tested different network architectures and the effect of different data sets, such as using only double or quad systems defined based on the source center and using different input distributions of θ<SUB>E</SUB>. We find that the CNN performs well, and with the network trained on both doubles and quads with a uniform distribution of θ<SUB>E</SUB> &gt; 0.5″ we obtain the following median values with 1σ scatter: Δx = (0.00<SUB>-0.30</SUB><SUP>+0.30</SUP>)″, Δy = (0.00<SUB>-0.29</SUB><SUP>+0.30</SUP>)″, Δθ<SUB>E</SUB> = (0.07<SUB>-0.12</SUB><SUP>+0.29</SUP>)″, Δe<SUB>x</SUB> = -0.01<SUB>-0.09</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP>, and Δe<SUB>y</SUB> = 0.00<SUB>-0.09</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP>. The bias in θ<SUB>E</SUB> is driven by systems with small θ<SUB>E</SUB>. Therefore, when we further predict the multiple lensed image positions and time-delays based on the network output, we apply the network to the sample limited to θ<SUB>E</SUB> &gt; 0.8″. In this case the offset between the predicted and input lensed image positions is (0.00<SUB>-0.29</SUB><SUP>+0.29</SUP>)″ and (0.00<SUB>-0.31</SUB><SUP>+0.32</SUP>)″ for the x and y coordinates, respectively. For the fractional difference between the predicted and true time-delay, we obtain 0.04<SUB>-0.05</SUB><SUP>+0.27</SUP>. Our CNN model is able to predict the SIE parameter values in fractions of a second on a single CPU, and with the output we can predict the image positions and time-delays in an automated way, such that we are able to process efficiently the huge amount of expected galaxy-scale lens detections in the near future.\",\n",

Comparison between neural network and semi-automated traditional modeling of strong lenses']\\n\\nModeling of strongly gravitationally lensed galaxies is often required in order to use them as astrophysical or cosmological probes. With current and upcoming wide-field imaging surveys, the number of detected lenses is increasing significantly such that automated and fast modeling procedures for ground-based data are urgently needed. This is especially pertinent to short-lived lensed transients in order to plan follow-up observations. Therefore, we present in a companion paper a neural network predicting the parameter values with corresponding uncertainties of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass profile with external shear. In this work, we also present a newly developed pipeline glee_auto.py that can be used to model any galaxy-scale lensing system consistently. In contrast to previous automated modeling pipelines that require high-resolution space-based images, glee_auto.py is optimized to work well on ground-based images such as those from the Hyper-Suprime-Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program or the upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time. We further present glee_tools.py, a flexible automation code for individual modeling that has no direct decisions and assumptions implemented on the lens system setup or image resolution. Both pipelines, in addition to our modeling network, minimize the user input time drastically and thus are important for future modeling efforts. We applied the network to 31 real galaxy-scale lenses of HSC and compare the results to traditional, Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling-based models obtained from our semi-autonomous pipelines. In the direct comparison, we find a very good match for the Einstein radius. The lens mass center and ellipticity show reasonable agreement. The main discrepancies pretrain to the external shear, as is expected from our tests on mock systems where the neural network always predicts values close to zero for the complex components of the shear. In general, our study demonstrates that neural networks are a viable and ultra fast approach for measuring the lens-galaxy masses from ground-based data in the upcoming era with ~10<SUP>5</SUP> lenses expected.\",\n",

Evaluation of supervised neural networks for strong-lens searches in ground-based imaging surveys']\\n\\nWhile supervised neural networks have become state of the art for identifying the rare strong gravitational lenses from large imaging data sets, their selection remains significantly affected by the large number and diversity of nonlens contaminants. This work evaluates and compares systematically the performance of neural networks in order to move towards a rapid selection of galaxy-scale strong lenses with minimal human input in the era of deep, wide-scale surveys. We used multiband images from PDR2 of the HSC Wide survey to build test sets mimicking an actual classification experiment, with 189 strong lenses previously found over the HSC footprint and 70,910 nonlens galaxies in COSMOS. Multiple networks were trained on different sets of realistic strong-lens simulations and nonlens galaxies, with various architectures and data pre-processing. The overall performances strongly depend on the construction of the ground-truth training data and they typically, but not systematically, improve using our baseline residual network architecture. Improvements are found when applying random shifts to the image centroids and square root stretches to the pixel values, adding z band, or using random viewpoints of the original images, but not when adding difference images to subtract emission from the central galaxy. The most significant gain is obtained with committees of networks trained on different data sets, and showing a moderate overlap between populations of false positives. Nearly-perfect invariance to image quality can be achieved by training networks either with large number of bands, or jointly with the PSF and science frames. Overall, we show the possibility to reach a TPR0 as high as 60% for the test sets under consideration, which opens promising perspectives for pure selection of strong lenses without human input using the Rubin Observatory and other forthcoming ground-based surveys.\",\n",

Identifying galaxy-scale strong gravitational lenses in Pan-STARRS using convolutional neural networks\\']\\n\\nWe present a systematic search for wide-separation (with Einstein radius θ<SUB>E</SUB> ≳ 1.5″), galaxy-scale strong lenses in the 30 000 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the Pan-STARRS 3π survey on the Northern sky. With long time delays of a few days to weeks, these types of systems are particularly well-suited for catching strongly lensed supernovae with spatially-resolved multiple images and offer new insights on early-phase supernova spectroscopy and cosmography. We produced a set of realistic simulations by painting lensed COSMOS sources on Pan-STARRS image cutouts of lens luminous red galaxies (LRGs) with redshift and velocity dispersion known from the sloan digital sky survey (SDSS). First, we computed the photometry of mock lenses in gri bands and applied a simple catalog-level neural network to identify a sample of 1 050 207 galaxies with similar colors and magnitudes as the mocks. Second, we trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) on Pan-STARRS gri image cutouts to classify this sample and obtain sets of 105 760 and 12 382 lens candidates with scores of p<SUB>CNN</SUB> &gt; 0.5 and &gt; 0.9, respectively. Extensive tests showed that CNN performances rely heavily on the design of lens simulations and the choice of negative examples for training, but little on the network architecture. The CNN correctly classified 14 out of 16 test lenses, which are previously confirmed lens systems above the detection limit of Pan-STARRS. Finally, we visually inspected all galaxies with p<SUB>CNN</SUB> &gt; 0.9 to assemble a final set of 330 high-quality newly-discovered lens candidates while recovering 23 published systems. For a subset, SDSS spectroscopy on the lens central regions proves that our method correctly identifies lens LRGs at z ∼ 0.1-0.7. Five spectra also show robust signatures of high-redshift background sources, and Pan-STARRS imaging confirms one of them as a quadruply-imaged red source at z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.185, which is likely a recently quenched galaxy strongly lensed by a foreground LRG at z<SUB>d</SUB> = 0.3155. In the future, high-resolution imaging and spectroscopic follow-up will be required to validate Pan-STARRS lens candidates and derive strong lensing models. We also expect that the efficient and automated two-step classification method presented in this paper will be applicable to the ∼4 mag deeper gri stacks from the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with minor adjustments. <P />Full Table 1 is only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href=\"http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/644/A163\">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/644/A163</A>',\n",

Its formation mechanism is still debated, however. Observations of formamide, related species, and their isopotologues may provide useful clues to the chemical pathways leading to their formation.

While this molecule has been observed in space, most of its detections correspond to high-mass star-forming regions. Motivated by this lack of investigation in the low-mass regime, we searched for formamide, as well as isocyanic acid (HNCO), in 10 low- and intermediate-mass pre-stellar and protostellar objects. The present work is part of the IRAM Large Programme ASAI (Astrochemical Surveys At IRAM), which makes use of unbiased broad-band spectral surveys at millimetre wavelengths. We detected HNCO in all the sources and NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO in five of them. We derived their abundances and analysed them together with those reported in the literature for high-mass sources. For those sources with formamide detection, we found a tight and almost linear correlation between HNCO and NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO abundances, with their ratio being roughly constant - between 3 and 10 - across 6 orders of magnitude in luminosity. This suggests the two species are chemically related. The sources without formamide detection, which are also the coldest and devoid of hot corinos, fall well off the correlation, displaying a much larger amount of HNCO relative to NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO. Our results suggest that, while HNCO can be formed in the gas-phase during the cold stages of star formation, NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO forms most efficiently on the mantles of dust grains at these temperatures, where it remains frozen until the temperature rises enough to sublimate the icy grain mantles.

The detection of formamide in comets, which are believed to have --at least partially-- inherited their current chemical composition during the birth of the Solar System, raises the question whether a non-negligible amount of formamide may have been exogenously delivered onto a very young Earth about four billion years ago. A crucial part of the effort to answer this question involves searching for formamide in regions where stars and planets are forming today in our Galaxy, as this can shed light on its formation, survival, and chemical re-processing along the different evolutionary phases leading to a star and planetary system like our own. The present review primarily addresses the chemistry of formamide in the interstellar medium, from the point of view of (i) astronomical observations, (ii) experiments, and (iii) theoretical calculations.

Although detected in the interstellar medium for decades, its formation route is still debated, whether in the gas phase or on the dust grain surfaces. Molecular deuteration has proven to be, in other cases, an efficient way to identify how a molecule is synthesized. For formamide, new published observations towards the IRAS16293-2422 B hot corino show that its three deuterated forms have all the same deuteration ratio, 2-5 per cent and that this is a factor of 3-8 smaller than that measured for H<SUB>2</SUB>CO towards the IRAS16293-2422 protostar. Following a previous work on the gas-phase formamide formation via the reaction NH<SUB>2</SUB> + H<SUB>2</SUB>CO → HCONH<SUB>2</SUB> + H, we present here new calculations of the rate coefficients for the production of monodeuterated formamide through the same reaction, starting from monodeuterated NH<SUB>2</SUB> or H<SUB>2</SUB>CO. Some misconceptions regarding our previous treatment of the reaction are also cleared up. The results of the new computations show that, at the 100 K temperature of the hot corino, the rate of deuteration of the three forms is the same, within 20 per cent. On the contrary, the reaction between non-deuterated species proceeds three times faster than that with deuterated ones.

The relative apparent band strengths, positions, and full width half maxima (FWHM) of these features in mixtures at various temperatures were also determined. All of the laboratory spectra are available to the community on the Leiden Ice Database for Astrochemistry (LIDA) for use in the interpretation of both observations (e.g., from JWST) and laboratory spectroscopic data.

A comparison between the formamide CH bend in laboratory data and the 7.24 μm band in the observations tentatively indicates that, if formamide ice is contributing significantly to the observed absorption, it is more likely in a polar matrix.

The aim of this study is to provide accurate spectroscopic parameters and rotational transition frequencies for thioformamide to enable astronomical searches for this molecule using radio telescope arrays at millimeter wavelengths. <BR /> Methods: The rotational spectrum of thioformamide was measured and analyzed in the frequency range 150-660 GHz using the Lille spectrometer. We searched for thioformamide toward the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius (Sgr) B2(N) using the ReMoCA spectral line survey carried out with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array. <BR /> Results: Accurate rigid rotor and centrifugal distortion constants were obtained from the analysis of the ground state of parent, <SUP>34</SUP>S, <SUP>13</SUP>C, and <SUP>15</SUP>N singly substituted isotopic species of thioformamide.

Thioformamide was not detected toward the hot cores Sgr B2(N1S) and Sgr B2(N2).

This is markedly different from methanethiol, which is only about two orders of magnitude less abundant than methanol in both sources. <BR /> Conclusions: The different behavior shown by methanethiol versus thioformamide may be caused by the preferential formation of the latter (on grains) at late times and low temperatures, when CS abundances are depressed.

       "  \"['Formation of the Simplest Amide in Molecular Clouds: Formamide (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO) and Its Derivatives in H<SUB>2</SUB>O-rich and CO-rich Interstellar Ice Analogs upon VUV Irradiation']\\n\\nThe astronomical detection of formamide (NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO) toward various star-forming regions and in cometary material implies that the simplest amide might have an early origin in dark molecular clouds at low temperatures. Laboratory studies have proven the efficient NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO formation in interstellar CO:NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice analogs upon energetic processing. However, it is still under debate, whether the proposed radical-radical recombination reactions forming complex organic molecules remain valid in an abundant H<SUB>2</SUB>O environment. The aim of this work was to investigate the formation of NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO in H<SUB>2</SUB>O- and CO-rich ices under conditions prevailing in molecular clouds. Therefore, different ice mixtures composed of H<SUB>2</SUB>O:CO:NH<SUB>3</SUB> (10:5:1), CO:NH<SUB>3</SUB> (4:1), and CO:NH<SUB>3</SUB> (0.6:1) were exposed to vacuum ultraviolet photons in an ultra-high vacuum chamber at 10 K. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy was utilized to monitor in situ the initial and newly formed species as a function of photon fluence. The infrared spectral identifications are complementarily secured by a temperature-programmed desorption experiment combined with a quadrupole mass spectrometer. The energetic processing of CO:NH<SUB>3</SUB> ice mixtures mainly leads to the formation of NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO, along with its chemical derivatives such as isocyanic acid (HNCO) and cyanate ion (OCN<SUP>-</SUP>). The formation kinetics of NH<SUB>2</SUB>CHO shows an explicit dependency on ice ratios and compositions; the highest yield is found in H<SUB>2</SUB>O-rich ice. The astronomical relevance of the resulting reaction network is discussed.\",\n",
